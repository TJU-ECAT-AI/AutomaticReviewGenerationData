Abstract
Two samples of silica with different surface area have been used in the preparation of silica-supported tungsten oxide
catalysts with W loading ranging from 0.8 to 15.8 wt%. Both catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of
methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure. It has been shown that both surface area and
tungsten loading affect the nature and dispersion of the tungsten oxide species and, therefore, the catalytic behavior of the
samples. Poor dispersion and high reducibility of the tungsten oxide phase is observed for the low surface area catalysts, thus
leading to a high activity per unit area in methane conversion. High surface catalysts show a well-dispersed and hardly
reducible tungsten oxide overlayer that covers the active sites of the silica surface. Consequently, a negative effect on the
catalytic activity is observed. Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active
sites present on the W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites and W±O±W functionalities. These
results agree with those previously reported by the authors for W/HZSM-5 catalysts. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
The partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates at
atmospheric pressures has been widely studied in the
last years. Among a great variety of catalysts
employed, silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 have been
reported to be the most active in formaldehyde pro-
duction [1]. Likewise, other carriers such as TiO2 [2±
4] and SnO2 [4] have been used, the results achieved
being poorer. One of the reasons for the good catalytic
performance of silica based catalysts is the ability of
the bare silica to yield HCOH in methane oxidation.
Among different commercial silica, the best yields
have been obtained with ``precipitated'' SiO2 [5,6].
Several works have focused on the establishment of
the relationship between metal oxide overlayer struc-
ture and its role in the reaction mechanism. Thus,
some factors such as catalyst reducibility [7±10] and
density of different type of active sites [2,3,11±13]
have been correlated to the catalytic behavior. It has
been shown that the catalytic properties of silica
supported MoO3 and V2O5 are strongly affected by
the interaction between metal oxide species and sup-
port which in turn controls both reducibility and
dispersion of the active phase. Recently, Parmaliana
et al. [10] have shown the in¯uence of metal oxide

loading on the mechanism of the reaction. However,
despite the literature reported, there is practically no
paper in which the simultaneous in¯uence of both
silica surface area and metal oxide loading on the
catalytic pattern is speci®cally studied.
On the other hand, several authors have shown the
chemical similarities existing between MoO3 and
WO3 overlayers in silica and alumina supported cat-
alysts [15±17]. Speci®cally, Salvati et al. [15] showed
that WO3/Al2O3 catalysts were structurally similar to
MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts and that the WO4
2ÿ interaction
species closely resembled the molybdenum±alumina
surface complex. In spite of this fact and the high
stability of tungsten oxide, there are, however, few
works reporting the use of tungsten oxide based
catalysts in the methane partial oxidation. Ban
Äares
et al. [7] employed MOx/SiO2 catalysts (MV, Mo, W
and Re) in the title reaction showing that tungsten
oxide phase was active in formaldehyde production. In
a previous work [14], the partial oxidation of methane
to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as an oxi-
dant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts. Three
different types of supported species were detected:
tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric
species and WO3 crystallites. Furthermore, it was
shown that HCOH selectivity seemed to be dependent
on both dispersion and nature of the tungsten species
over the catalyst.
The aim of this paper is
1. to check the effect of surface area of the silica
carrier and tungsten loading on the structure of the
supported oxide phase;
2. to relate it to the observed catalytic behavior; and
3. to compare the results obtained to those previously
reported for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Two precipitated silica samples were used in this
work. One with surface area of 55 m2/g (Probus) will
be named as LSiO2 and another one with surface area
of 400 m2/g (BDH) will be referred to as HSiO2. Both
samples were used as received. Two series of tungsten
catalysts were respectively prepared by aqueous
impregnation of the silica powder with different
amounts of ammonium metatungstate (Aldrich) to
give tungsten loading in the range 0.8±15.8 wt%.
After water removal from a rotary evaporator, the
impregnated were calcined in air at 6758C for 2.5 h.
The catalysts prepared from low and high surface area
silica are named as LSiWx and HSiWx, respectively, x
indicating the weight percentage of tungsten in the
catalyst.
2.2. Catalytic runs
Methane conversion tests were performed at atmo-
spheric pressure in a quartz tubular ¯ow reactor (the
dimensions of the reaction zone were i.d. 21.4 mm,
length 60 mm). Other components of the reaction
system were a gas feed system for each reactive
(methane and oxygen), with an individual control
by mass ¯ow meters and an exit gas ¯ow meter. Three
heating zones surrounded the reactor. The temperature
of each zone was independently controlled within
18C by temperature controllers. A thermocouple
was placed in the center of the bed in order to measure
the reaction temperature. With this reactor design, a
variation of only 58C was observed along the cat-
alytic bed. All the products were analyzed using a
Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector and two columns:
a Porapak Q column to separate CH4, CO2, COO2,
HCOH and water and a molecular sieve 5A packed
column to separate CO and O2. Formaldehyde cali-
bration was obtained with 40% HCOH aqueous solu-
tion.
In all experiments catalyst samples were pretreated
``in situ'' in an oxygen ¯ow from the ambient tem-
perature to the reaction temperature, 6508C, and held
at the latter approximately for 1 h. Space velocity of
the feed was 7.41 g h molÿ1 and the CH4:O2 molar
ratio was 5.3:1. It was proven that approximately 2 h
were required to reach apparently steady conditions.
Sampling of the product stream was repeated until the
analytical results were reproducible. In the present
research, the carbon balance is always better than
97%.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area and micropore volumes of the
calcined samples were measured by using a Quanta-
144

chrome Autosorb-1 apparatus with nitrogen as the
adsorbate (N2 molecule surface16.2 A
Ê 2). X-ray
powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a Philips
PW1710 diffractometer using Cu K radiation. H2-
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measure-
ments were performed on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR
analyzer. The samples (usually 0.035 g) were pre-
treated from ambient temperature to 6758C in argon
¯ow. Following pretreatment, the samples were
cooled at room temperature and the gas switched
to 17% H2 in argon mixture. The gas ¯ow was
50 Ncm3/min and the temperature was raised at
108C/min from ambient temperature to 9008C. During
this time the exit gas was monitored using a TCD
detector. The unique area under the curve was
integrated to evaluate the hydrogen consumption.
The relative reducibility values of the samples,
expressed as (mol H2 consumed/mol W of sample)/
(mol H2 consumed/mol W of WO3), were calculated
by comparison with the amount of hydrogen con-
sumed by a WO3 sample (Merck). UV diffuse re¯ec-
tance spectra (UV DRS) were performed by using
Spectralon as a reference on a Perkin Elmer Lambda-
20 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse re¯ectance
accessory. The spectra were recorded immediately
after calcination of the samples. The scanning wave-
length range was 198±500 nm and the scan speed was
120 nm/min.
3. Results
3.1. Structure of the supported tungsten species
BET surface areas of the two series of W/SiO2
catalysts are listed in Table 1, showing a surface area
decrease with increasing amounts of tungsten in both
catalyst series. This fact is analogous to that observed
for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14]. Likewise, in Table 1
are shown the surface concentration values of the
catalysts in terms of atoms of tungsten per nm2,
assuming 100% dispersion. According to Salvati
et al. [15], the theoretical monolayer coverage in
tungsten oxide catalysts is reached for 4.3 W atoms
per nm2. It can be seen for LSiW catalyst series that
silica surface would be completely covered for
7.1 wt% W loading and above. In contrast, for the
high area silica the theoretical monolayer coverage is
not reached in any case.
The UV diffuse re¯ectance spectra of the LSiWand
HSiW catalyst series are shown in Figs. 1 and 2,
respectively. The spectrum of LSiW 0.8 catalyst is
not shown in Fig. 1 because of the low absorbance
values obtained. Three bands can be seen in these
spectra. A major band in the range 250±325 nm can be
observed for all the catalysts with W loading higher
than 0.8 wt%. This band is more intense for HSiW
samples. The UV DRS spectrum of HSiW 0.8 shows a
single band at 220 nm, this band appearing as a
shoulder for the rest of the samples. Finally, a third
band at about 375±400 nm can be seen for W loading
above 4.0 and 7.1 wt% in the LSiW and in HSiW
catalysts, respectively. The relative intensity of the
different bands is dependent on both the support and
W loading. According to a previous work [14] these
three bands can be assigned as follows: the 220 nm
band, to tetrahedral monomeric tungstate species; the
250±325 nm one, to octahedral polytungstate species;
and the 375±400 nm band, to WO3 crystallites. There-
fore, it can be said that these three types of tungsten
species exist in W/SiO2 catalysts. Several authors have
described these three tungsten species in silica, alu-

In Figs. 3 and 4 the XRD patterns of the two
catalyst series are shown. In both the ®gures, the
XRD pattern of crystalline WO3 is included for com-
parison. For LSiW catalysts, peaks corresponding to
the presence of a crystalline WO3 phase begin to
appear at W loading of 4.0 wt%, their intensity
increasing with the tungsten loading. In HSiW cata-
lysts, the presence of crystallites of WO3 is only
detected for the highest W loading. Since a minimum
size of the crystal (50 A
Ê ) is required for XRD
detection these results are in good agreement with
those obtained by diffuse re¯ectance.
The TPR curves for the two catalyst series and the
bulk WO3 in the range 300±9008C are comparatively
shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The TPR pro®le of bulk WO3
exhibits two peaks with maxima at 6558C and 7408C.

These peaks may be assigned to the step-wise reduc-
tion of WO3 to W0 (WVI ! WIV ! W0). As seen in
Fig. 5, the TPR patterns of LSiW catalysts (with
except of LSiW 0.8) present two peaks at 6308C
and 710±7508C which monotonically increase in
intensity with W loading. These peaks seem to corre-
spond with the peaks of the WO3 TPR pro®le. This
fact would indicate a poor dispersion of the tungsten
oxide species on the low surface silica [3]. This idea is
supported by the high relative reducibility values
obtained (Fig. 7) which are very similar to that of
the bulk tungsten oxide. These results agree with those
obtained with UV diffuse re¯ectance spectroscopy
and XRD.
On the other hand, the TPR patterns of HSiW
catalysts
(Fig. 6)
with
tungsten
loading
up
to
7.1 wt% do not show any hydrogen consumption up
to ca. 8508C. For the HSiW 4.0 and HSiW 7.1
catalysts a broad peak with very low intensity can
be seen at 8708C and 8508C, respectively. The TPR
curve of the HSiW 11.9 catalyst shows three unre-
solved weak peaks at 530±6058C, 7048C, 8038C. The
HSiW 15.8 catalyst exhibit a TPR pro®le consisting of
two major overlapped peaks at 520±6058C and 6988C
together with a small peak at 8078C. Peaks at 520±
6058C and 7008C of the HSiW 11.9 and HSiW 15.8
catalysts seem to correspond again with those of the
bulk WO3. The highest temperature peak may be
attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed tungsten
species [3]. The shift of this peak towards lower
temperatures, occurring at higher W loading, re¯ects
an improved reducibility of dispersed species, likely
enabled by the ``autocatalytic effect'' exerted by the
increased tungsten concentration [3]. The low relative
reducibility values of the HSiW catalysts (Fig. 7)
would indicate the existence of a strong interaction
between the supported phase and the silica surface
leading to a good dispersion of the tungsten species.

3.2. Methane oxidation
Formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and
water are the unique products obtained in the partial
oxidation of methane over W/SiO2 catalysts. Catalytic
results for the LSiW and HSiW catalysts are summar-
ized in Table 2.
A blank experiment using a CSi bed was performed
in order to evaluate the signi®cance of the homoge-
neous reaction in the pre-heated zone of the reactor. A
methane conversion of 0.8 mol% was obtained,
carbon oxides being the unique products formed
(mainly CO2). The contribution of the homogeneous
reaction was not taken into account in the methane
conversion values since it is equal for all the runs.
The two bare precipitated silica samples lead to
similar methane conversion values, although the high
surface area silica exhibits a higher selectivity to
formaldehyde. Likewise, it can be noted that for the
LSiW catalysts methane conversion changes slightly
with the tungsten loading.
Fig. 8 shows the selectivity of HCOH, CO and CO2
vs. methane conversion. Despite the great variation in
surface area, both tungsten catalyst series show several
common features:
1. formaldehyde selectivity values are quite similar;
2. carbon dioxide is the predominant oxidation pro-
duct; and
3. HCOH and CO2 selectivity exhibit a similar trend
that it is complementary to that of the CO one,
indicating that CO proceeds in some extent from a
further oxidation of HCOH.
This latter finding has been reported by several authors
for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [20±22]. Nevertheless, a
remarkable difference can be noted: while for the
LSiW series HCOH and CO2 selectivities increase
with methane conversion, for the HSiW catalysts an
opposite effect is seen.
Although the formaldehyde selectivity and STY
(space±time yield) values obtained are too low for a
possible industrial application of the process, they are
in the same order of magnitude than other data pre-
viously reported for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [1,4,6,9,27].
4. Discussion
4.1. Nature of the supported tungsten oxide phase
As noted in Section 1 the similarity existing
between WO3 and MoO3 is re¯ected in the structure
of the overlayers that both oxides form over supported
catalysts [15±17]. Several authors have reported that
the structure of the supported phase of W/SiO2 and
Mo/SiO2 catalysts follows the metal oxide aqueous
chemistry as a function of the net surface pH at point

of zero charge (PZC) [17,23,24]. Above a W concen-
tration of 0.1 M, aqueous tungstate anions exist in two
structures: a tetrahedrally coordinated WO4

and an octahedrally coordinated W12 polyoxoanion.

In alkaline solutions the tungstate monomer is the
predominant species and is stable in neutral solutions.
The polytungstate species is present at pH 7±8 and is
the predominant one in acidic solutions. The silica
support possesses an acidic pH at PZC (pH4) and the
addition of the tungsten oxide leads to a further
decrease of the surface net pH at PZC for the W/
SiO2 catalyst [17]. According to this, the polytungstate
must be the predominant species in the catalysts used
here.
The band assigned to octahedral polytungstate spe-
cies in the UV diffuse re¯ectance spectra is for W
loading higher than 0.8 wt% the most intense in the
two catalyst series. In the LSiW catalysts, both the
agglomeration of these species with increasing W
loading and the calcination step lead to W loading
of 4.0 wt% and above, to the formation of WO3
crystallites. This fact can be clearly observed in the
XRD patterns of these catalysts (Fig. 3). On the other
hand, in the high surface area silica this picture only
occurs, although to a minor extent, for the highest W
loading (Fig. 4). Therefore, the difference existing in
the surface area of the two silica supports seems to be
responsible for the better dispersion of tungsten oxide
species in HSiW catalysts. The relative reducibility
values showed in Fig. 7 demonstrate this ®nding.
As noted in Figs. 1 and 2, together with the bands
corresponding to polymeric W(VI) species, a band
appeared at 220 nm. This band, attributed to the
formation of tetrahedrally coordinated species, is
the only one in the HSiW 0.8 catalyst. Although the
existence of this kind of species is in discrepancy with
a previous work by Kim and coworkers [17], other
authors have reported for low-loaded Mo/SiO2 cata-
lysts the presence of tetrahedral species [21,22,25,26].
The following general picture can be concluded
from the characterization results of the two catalyst
series:
1. LSiW series: for the lowest W loading catalysts, a
dispersed tungsten oxide phase constituted of both
tetrahedral and polytungstate species exists. For
higher loading, 4.0 wt% and above, the silica
surface is progressively covered by polytungstate
species that agglomerate forming WO3 clusters.
Since the similar reducibility and UV DRS spectra
of the LSiW catalysts with tungsten loading higher
than 4.0%, it may be drawn that for 7.1 wt%
loading and above the silica surface is completely
covered. This ®nding is in good agreement with
the theoretical monolayer coverage data reported
in literature [15].
2. HSiW series: HSiW 0.8 catalyst possesses only
tetrahedral tungsten species. A well-dispersed
tungsten oxide phase mainly consisting of poly-
tungstate species is formed up to 11.9 wt% loading,

gradually covering the silica surface. For the high-
est loading WO3 aggregates begins to be formed to
some extent.
4.2. Nature of the active sites for methane oxidation
Although there is a slight difference in the catalytic
performance of both tungsten catalyst series (Table 2),
a more detailed analysis of the results must be made on
the basis of the great variation in the surface area of the
supports. For this purpose, the catalytic results have
been de®ned in terms of speci®c surface activity (SSA,
mol CH4 converted/m2 s) and formaldehyde surface
productivity (SPHCOH, mol HCOH obtained/m2 s). It
can be seen in Fig. 9 that the SSA values of the LSiW
catalysts are about one order of magnitude higher than
those of the HSiW series. This fact can be explained
taking into account the difference existing between the
SSA of the two bare silica samples. The results
obtained show that the density of the active sites
for methane activation on the low surface silica is
about one order of magnitude higher than that on
HSiO2 support. On the other hand, the SPHCOH value
(Fig. 10) for this latter sample is only about half of that
for LSiO2 support. In the same way, this fact suggests
that the density of active sites for HCOH production is
higher on the high surface silica. According to Miceli
et al. [27], precipitated silica possesses two kinds of
active sites in reaction conditions: reduced sites and
siloxane bridges (Si±O±Si) which are effective in
activating O2 and CH4 molecules, respectively. The
activated oxygen species react with methane activated
molecules mainly yielding HCOH and CO2 [8,9].
Therefore, a higher number of the ®rst type of sites
would explain the higher selectivity to HCOH and
CO2 exhibited for HSiO2 sample (Table 2).
The effect of the tungsten oxide phase as a promot-
ing of the catalytic activity of the silica surface is quite
different in the two catalyst series. In the LSiW series,
the tungsten overlayer enhances for any W loading
both the SSA and SPHCOH of the silica (Figs. 9 and
10). On the other hand, in the HSiW catalysts with
tungsten contents up to 7.1 wt%, the SSA of the bare
silica is improved whereas higher W loading induces a
negative effect (Fig. 9). Likewise, tungsten addition
causes a decrease in the SPHCOH of the unpromoted
high surface area silica (Fig. 10).
As observed there are catalysts with similar type of
tungsten species belonging to different series that,
however, present quite a different catalytic perfor-
mance, i.e. LSiW 4.0 and HSiW 11.9. It may be
suggested that in addition to the kind of tungsten
species, other factors like the reducibility of the
supported oxide phase would be responsible for the

opposite catalytic activity showed by the two catalyst
series. In fact, this reducibility would allow one to
suppose how reduced the catalyst would be during the
reaction conditions and therefore its catalytic behavior
[7]. The gas-phase oxygen is activated in the reduced
sites under reaction conditions and enables methane
activation [7,28]. Parmaliana et al. [8±10] have cor-
related the density of reduced sites of the MoO3/SiO2
and V2O5/SiO2 and its catalytic performance in the
partial oxidation of methane. According to them, the
presence of ``highly reducible'' tungsten oxide phase
in the low surface silica (Fig. 7) produces an increase
in the number of active sites up to 7.1 wt% tungsten
loading. For higher loading, the silica surface is
supposed to be completely covered by the tungsten
oxide overlayer, which does not change in nature but
only in the number of layers of tungsten atoms. UV
DRS spectra (Fig. 1) and reducibility values (Fig. 7)
of these catalysts support this hypothesis.
On the other hand, for the HSiW catalysts the
progressive covering of the silica surface by ``hardly
reducible'' dispersed polytungstate phase (Fig. 7)
leads to an approximately linear decrease in the
SSA from 0.8 to 11.9 wt% tungsten loading. This
trend is not observed in the highest loaded catalyst
because the aggregation of tungsten species increases
its reducibility (Fig. 7). The apparent improvement in
the SSA of the unpromoted silica for W loading up to
7.1 wt% can be attributed to the marked decrease in
BET area that induces an increase in the number of
active sites per unit area.
Nowadays, a general agreement about the speci®-
city of the M=O sites (M=Mo, V) of terminal atoms in
metal oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species
in the selective production of HCOH from methane
over MoO3/SiO2 and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts seems to
exist [2,3,11±13]. Our results seem to agree with this
idea. Thus, the presence of the LSiW catalysts with W
loading higher than 4.0 wt% of W=O terminal sites in
WO3 crystallites would be responsible for the high
HCOH
selectivity
exhibited
by
these
catalysts
(Table 2). For the HSiW catalysts, on account of
the high surface area of the support, the SPHCOH will
be a function of both density and activity of three types
of surface sites, namely: active sites of silica surface;
W±O±W bridging funcionalities, that enable total
oxidation of either CH4 or CO [3,12,13,26]; and
W=O terminal sites. Thus, the SPHCOH progressively
decreases with increasing W loading up to 11.9 wt%
due to an increased polytungstate formation which
induces the covering of the active sites of the silica
surface and providing of the W±O±W sites. For the
highest tungsten loading the presence of certain num-
ber of WO3 crystallites with terminal W=O bonds
causes a slight improvement on the HCOH selectivity.
4.3. Comparison between catalytic performance of
W/SiO2 and W/HZSM-5 catalyst
In this section, a comparison between the results
obtained in the present work and those previously
reported for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14] has been estab-
lished.
The
characterization
of
W/HZSM-5
catalysts
yielded the following picture [14]:
1. For tungsten loading lower than 4.0%, tetrahedral
tungsten species (grafted to Brùnsted acid sites of
the zeolite) were predominant though polytung-
state species and WO3 crystallites were present to
a minor extent (these latter for W loading higher
than 2.4%). Because of their high dispersion on
the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, the tungsten
oxide overlayer was hardly reducible.
2. For higher tungsten, loading the external surface of
the zeolite was gradually covered by polymeric
species and WO3 aggregates leading to a lesser-
dispersed tungsten oxide phase. Consequently, a
significant improvement of the reducibility was
observed.
As seen in Fig. 9, the SSA values achieved with W/
HZSM-5 catalysts are between those of the HSiW and
LSiW catalyst series. These results strongly support
the fact concerning the in¯uence of the catalyst redu-
cibility on methane activation. In fact, the relative
reducibility values owing to W/HZSM-5 catalysts are
higher than those of the HSiW catalysts but lower than
those of the LSiW series (Fig. 7). Since acid sites of
HZSM-5 were reported to be active sites for methane
activation [14], their progressive covering by tungsten
species would lead to a decrease in the SSA of the
zeolite. However, the observed increase in tungsten
oxide overlayer reducibility with increasing W load-
ing, mainly for contents higher than 4.0 wt%, leads to
a signi®cant improvement in the SSA of the HZSM-5.
The formaldehyde surface productivity values
obtained for W/HZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 10) are in
A. de Lucas et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 184 (1999) 143±152
151
the same order of magnitude than those of HSiW
series, therefore being lower than those of LSiW ones
(Fig. 10). This fact is a consequence of the high
activity showed by the acid sites of HZSM-5 zeolite
towards the total oxidation of methane to carbon
oxides (mainly CO) [14]. Up to 2.4% W loading
the presence of monomeric tungsten species with
W=O sites increases sharply the SPHCOH. For higher
contents, the simultaneous increase for polytungstate
species and WO3 crystallites leads to a slight increase
in the SPHCOH. This fact is in agreement with the
different activity of W±O±W bridges and terminal
W=O sites pointed out above for W/SiO2 catalysts.
5. Conclusions
It has been shown that both surface area of the
precipitated silica and tungsten loading play a funda-
mental role in the nature of the tungsten oxide over-
layer
and,
as
a
consequence,
in
the
catalytic
performance of W/SiO2 catalysts. For the low surface
catalyst series, the supported tungsten oxide phase
consists of polytungstate species and WO3 crystallites,
which for W loading higher than 7.1 wt% completely
cover the silica surface. For the high surface catalyst
series a well-dispersed tungsten oxide overlayer
mainly consisting of polytungstate species is formed.
A close relationship between the dispersion of the
tungsten species and the catalyst reducibility is
observed. Thus, highly reducible tungsten oxide phase
of the low surface catalysts enhances the activity of the
bare silica whereas hardly reducible tungsten species
of the high surface catalysts exert a negative effect on
the silica activity. Formaldehyde production has been
related to the density and activity of three types of
active sites present in W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of
silica surface, terminal W=O sites, both leading to
HCOH formation, and W±O±W bridging funcional-
ities that enable total oxidation of either CH4 or CO.
These ®ndings are in good agreement with those
reported by the authors for W/HZSM-5 catalysts.
