Abstract
Single reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and dehydrogenation of propane with CO2
(DH-CO2) reactions in the presence and absence of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst have
been studied between 673 and 873 K. It was found that the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is
active both in the dehydrogenation of propane and in the RWGS reactions. The
obtained results suggest that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the
presence of CO2 on CrOx/SiO2 can be facilitated by the RWGS reaction.

INTRODUCTION
 
Propene is one of the most important substrates for chemical industry. It is
used mainly for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and
polypropylene. Industrially, propene is obtained predominantly from steam
cracking of natural gas or naphtha and from fluid catalytic cracking of liquid
petroleum products. An alternative commercialized technology is the catalytic
propane dehydrogenation. This process has however several disadvantages. The
dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic process which requires relatively
high temperatures and low pressures to obtain high propane conversion. For example,

an equilibrium propane conversion of 50 % under atmospheric pressure is
reached at around 868 K [1].  The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence
of CO2 is an attractive method to overcome the equilibrium limitation. As
shown by thermodynamic considerations, the conversion of propane can be
improved by coupling the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water-
gas shift reaction. For example, at 873 K and at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5,
the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92 %, while in the presence of an
inert gas, only 75 % conversion can be achieved under the same conditions [2].
 
Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have
been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most
promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic
performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and
CrOx/Diamond [5] systems.
 
The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of
hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the
catalyst surface. However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear. It
is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to make the
water gas (CO + H2O) or can act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative
dehydrogenation. It is difficult to determine which of the pathways
predominates. The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of
hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron
[10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is
more likely [12].
 
In the present paper, the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over the
CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is reported. We investigate the role of CO2 in this reaction
on the basis of the results obtained in the catalyzed and non-catalyzed RWGS
and DH-CO2 reactions.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst preparation and characterization
 
The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method
[13]. Silica (POCH, Poland) with a BET area 304 m2g-1, a pore volume of 0.74
cm3g-1 and an average pore diameter of 9.6 nm was used as the catalyst support.
The standard preparation procedure was as follows: 1.5 g of silica and 150 cm3
of 0.05 M chromium (III) nitrate (POCH, Poland) were placed in a 250 cm3
Erlenmeyer flask with a stirring bar. Enough NH3aq was added to the flask to
bring pH to 4.5.  The solution was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. After
that time the precipitate was filtered off, washed with distilled water, dried at
room temperature and calcinated at 923 K for 3 h in air.

The mass of Cr supported on SiO2 was determined with a Perkin Elmer
PLASMA 40 ICP emission spectrometer. The specific surface area (BET
method) of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was determined at 77 K using nitrogen as the
adsorbate.
For the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst obtained by the equilibrium adsorption method
the chromium loading and the SBET are 0.9 wt% Cr and 273 m2g-1, respectively.
Catalytic tests
 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence and absence of
CO2 was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a flow-type reactor. The feed
was a mixture of 12.5 vol % of  propane and 87.5 vol % of carbon dioxide (or
helium). The total flow rate was 30 cm3min-1. The catalyst was first preheated in
a helium stream at 873 K and then the reaction was started between 673 and 873
K. The reactants and products were analysed on-line using two gas
chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a 3 m glass column (3 mm
i.d.), packed with Porapak Q and a flame ionization detector. This
chromatograph was used to analyse hydrocarbons C1-C3. The second
chromatograph was equipped with a 3 m stainless steel column of the same
diameter packed with Carboxen 1000, and a thermal conductivity detector (for
CO, H2 and CO2 analyses).
 
The reverse water-gas shift reaction was conducted under the same
conditions, by replacing propane with hydrogen.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Promoting effect of CO2
 
A comparison of the results obtained in the dehydrogenation of propane to
propene in the presence and absence of CO2 on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst are listed
in Table 1. It can be seen that the use of CO2 increases the conversion of
propane and the yield of propene in comparison to helium. Under CO2
atmosphere the propene yield and the propane conversion reached 33.5 % and
36.3 %, respectively, while under He 26.1 % and 28.7 %. The selectivities of
propene in both cases were between 91 % and 92.5 %.
 
In addition to propene, a small amount of by-products attributed to cracking
such as ethane, ethene and methane were also found   in the product flow.

The molar ratio of CO/H2 in the process with CO2 was close to unity. The
appearance of hydrogen could confirm the two-step pathway of propane
dehydrogenation, in which hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation (1), reacts
with CO2 in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2).

A trace of carbon monoxide was also formed in the reaction carried out without
CO2. This by-product was observed only at the initial step of dehydrogenation
of propane and was probably formed as a result of Cr6+ (presented on the
surface of the fresh catalyst) reduction by propane.
Figure 1 shows the catalyst performance in the dehydrogenation of propane
in the presence and absence of CO2 as a function of time-on-stream at 873 K. In
both atmospheres the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibit deactivation with similar
conversion-time patterns. After 4 h on-stream, the conversion of propane
decreased to 22.5 % in the presence of CO2, while that in the presence of He
decreased to 11.4 %.

Single RWGS and dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 reactions
 
In order to clarify the effect of CO2 on the catalyst performance, the single
RWGS and the dehydrogenation with CO2 reactions were conducted under the
same conditions in the presence and absence of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst. As
shown in Figs 2a and b, the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the RWGS and
the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 reactions. With increase of the
reaction temperature, propane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide conversions
increased. Much lower conversions were observed in the non-catalyzed
(homogeneous) reactions (Figs 2c and d). For example, at temperature 873 K
the conversions of hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the non-catalyzed RWGS
reaction were about an order of magnitude lower than those in the presence of
the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst. However, it has to be pointed out that the non-catalyzed
reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen proceeds easier than the reaction of
propane with carbon dioxide, and above 773 K there are some contributions of a
homogeneous reaction to both the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen
conversions.
 
The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane
conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by
synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions.
However, the behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in the case of the RWGS
reaction coupled with dehydrogenation reaction can be different than in the case
of single RWGS reaction. Therefore on the basis of the presented results we
cannot exclude the other explanation where CO2 acts as an oxidant in the
oxidative pathway (3, 4).

This mechanism was proposed as an alternative way of propene formation in the
