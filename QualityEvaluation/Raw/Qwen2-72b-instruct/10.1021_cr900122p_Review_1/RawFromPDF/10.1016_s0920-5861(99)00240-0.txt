Abstract
Growing concerns about the environmental impact of sulfur emissions from stationary sources, as well as recent regulatory
initiatives, have prompted investigations for advanced sulfur reduction strategies. Herein, we present a novel process/catalyst
combination for reducing tailgas SOx and H2S emissions to very low levels (1–5 ppmw). The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment
Process (MOST) consists of the following steps: (1) combustion of tailgas sulfur species to convert all sulfur species to
SO2/SO3; (2) adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent; and (3) in a separate step, reductive desorption of the sulfur as
a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S. The MOST Process utilizes a regenerable promoted spinel-based sorbent with
very high SOx uptake capacities (>50 wt%), and is both, robust and operationally simple. Catalyst selection, process scoping
studies, and characterization to help understand the nature of the oxidative sorption and reductive regeneration steps, as well
as the state of the sorbent during these steps, are described. ©2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In conventional reﬁning applications, sulfur is re-
moved from hydrocarbon streams by reductive pro-
cesses, such as catalytic hydroprocessing and catalytic
cracking, to yield hydrogen sulﬁde. The hydrogen sul-
ﬁde thus produced is typically collected by contact
with an amine-based solution [1]. Subsequent strip-
ping of the amine solution yields a concentrated acid
gas stream, which is fed to a Claus plant. In the Claus
plant, about a third of the hydrogen sulﬁde is com-
busted to form sulfur dioxide, which is then reacted
with the remaining hydrogen sulﬁde to yield elemental
sulfur and water. Because of equilibrium limitations,

only ca. 97% of the feed sulfur is recovered in a Claus
unit.
The remainder of the sulfur from such processing
must be treated prior to release to the atmosphere. Two
common types of tailgas treatment processes are the
Beavon/Stretford and selective amine adsorption pro-
cesses [2]. Both of these processes involve wet scrub-
bing, require hydrogen, and may be energy and labor
intensive. Both of these processes can reduce sulfur
emissions to several ppm, but are less effective in re-
moving CS2 or COS, or mitigating any CO which may
pass through the Claus plant.
A solid sorbent system which can combust the sul-
fur containing species and selectively capture the SO2
produced offers operational advantages over these wet
scrubbing processes. Herein, we describe a novel pro-
cess and catalyst combination, the Mobil Oil SOx
Treatment Process (MOST) for achieving these goals
[3]. This process consists of the following steps:

Scheme 1. The MOST Process for SOx removal in claus tailgas
operations.
(1) combust the Claus tailgas stream to raise its tem-
perature, convert all sulfur species (H2S and resid-
ual COS and CS2) to SO2/SO3, and convert CO
to CO2;
(2) adsorb the SOx onto a high-capacity solid sorbent,
in either a ﬁxed, moving, or ﬂuidized bed; and
(3) in a separate step (for swinging ﬁxed beds) or in
a separate vessel (for moving or ﬂuidized beds),
reductively desorb the sulfur from the solid as
a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and H2S,
which can then be recycled to the Claus unit for
further processing.
In this contribution, we describe the MOST process.
We discuss the oxidative sorption step, including cata-
lyst selection and characterization. The reductive des-
orption of sulfur species is discussed by describing
both the products and the thermodynamics of the re-
generation. We also include a brief discussion of the
MOST process conﬁguration.
2. Results and discussion
The MOST process scheme for Claus tailgas treat-
ment is illustrated in the catalytic cycle shown in
Scheme 1.
Here, we describe the ﬁrst step in this process
scheme — the oxidative sorption of sulfur oxides
under conditions suitable for Claus tailgas operation,
sorbent screening for this application, and a brief
description of the reaction chemistry.
2.1. Catalyst screening
Several potential sorbent candidates were chosen,
based on a desire to obtain high SOx uptakes per
weight of catalyst employed. The base materials cho-
sen for this application were high surface area alu-
mina and magnesium aluminate spinels (MgAl2O4

ditions: 1200◦F, 3500 GHSV; feed =1% SO2, 4% O2, 10% H2O,

and Mg2Al2O5), with ceria, vanadia, and/or platinum
as oxidation promoters. Conditions chosen for this
screening applications are 1200◦F and 3500 GHSV,
with a feed containing 1% SO2, 4% O2, and 10% H2O,
with nitrogen as diluent. It was assumed that SO2 is
oxidized to SO3 prior to sorption, so these uptakes
were calculated as grams of SO3 adsorbed divided by
weight of sorbent.
Utilizing these conditions, catalyst sulfation was
terminated when the efﬂuent SO2
concentration
exceeded 250 ppmv. A typical SO2 concentration pro-
ﬁle during adsorption is shown in Fig. 1. As indicated
by the data set, the efﬂuent SO2 level is extremely
low during the adsorption cycle, followed by a very
sharp breakthrough front — under these conditions
for high-capacity sorbents (vide infra), SO2 levels
<2 ppmw are noted for the ﬁrst 160 min of the run,
followed by an increase to well over 250 ppmw over
the course of the last few minutes. Clearly, bypassing
is negligible in this system. Further, the shape of this
curve is consistent with a bandwise sorption process.
Measured SOx uptakes utilizing the procedure de-
scribed above are listed in Table 1. The entries in
Table 1 illustrate two critical factors in catalyst selec-
tion — that both, effective oxidation promoters and a
high-capacity basic sorption site, such as magnesium
oxide based sites in magnesium aluminate spinel, are
essential for high SOx uptake capacity. Comparing en-
tries 2, 3, and 4 illustrate that, with ceria as oxidation
promoter, SOx uptake increases with magnesium con-
tent — from 7 wt% uptake for CeO2/Al2O3, to 20%
for CeO2/MgAl2O4 and 25% for CeO2/Mg2Al2O5.
Likewise, comparing entries 4, 6, and 7 illustrate that
utilizing the same magnesium aluminate spinel base,

more effective oxidation promoters, such as platinum
and combinations of vanadia and ceria, are more ef-
fective than ceria alone. Thus, while 25 wt% uptake
is measured for CeO2/Mg2Al2O5 , uptakes of 34 and
41 wt% are measured for 100 ppm Pt/Mg2Al2O5 and
V2O5/CeO2/Mg2Al2O5, respectively, which may be
more effective SO2 oxidation promoters than ceria
alone. As entry 1 illustrates, the lack of an oxidation
promoter leads to very low SOx uptakes — only 5 wt%
uptake is noted for Mg2Al2O5.
2.2. Oxidative SOx capture — reaction chemistry
and catalyst characterization
Understanding the reaction chemistry for the ad-
sorption step is based on both, characterization results
and discussions as to the functioning of FCC SOx
transfer additives. In Section 2.1, we have demon-
strated that both effective oxidation promoters and a
high-capacity basic site are essential for high SOx up-
take capacity. Given these observations, we propose
the following reactions (Scheme 2) as critical to ef-
fective SOx uptake.
Scheme 2 incorporates several key elements. First,
reactions (1) and (2) illustrate the combustion of H2S,
and other contaminants, such as COS, CO, and CS2.
Reaction (3) is reversible — under the conditions of
our study, thermodynamic equilibrium limits the con-
version of SO2 to ca. 50%. Reaction (4) requires a
basic metal oxide site capable of forming a stable
metal sulfate under these conditions. These consider-
ations underscore the necessity of effective oxidation
promoters for effective functioning, since the rate of

reaction (3) must be much faster than that of reaction
(4) for the bandwise sorption noted above.
Scheme 2 is also consistent with that proposed by
Hirschberg and Bertolacini [4] for the effective func-
tioning of SOx transfer additives. In this scheme, the
catalyst adsorbs SOx under oxidizing conditions in
the FCC regenerator and releases it as H2S in the
riser reactor, which is a reducing environment. This
proposal is also consistent with Bhattacharyya et. al.
[5], and Yoo et. al. [6,7], who discuss the use of
ceria-containing magnesium aluminate spinels as ad-
vanced catalysts for FCC SOx transfer applications.
In the latter work, it is reported that incorporation of
iron, vanadia, and chromium, as a solid solution in the
spinel, can aid in the reduction of the sulfated catalyst.
Catalyst characterization results of the fresh and
sulfated sorbent help in understanding the chemical
transformations occurring during the oxidative sorp-
tion step. Detailed characterization results will be pre-
sented in a publication to be issued shortly, however,
it sufﬁces here to present results germane to the above
discussion. XPS results are presented below (see
Table 2). Comparison of the sulfur 2p binding

energy of the sulfated sorbent (169.1 eV) to the ref-
erence compounds of the fresh oxide (170.0) and
MgSO4 (169.0) are consistent with formation of a
metal sulfate. Comparison of the Mg 2p binding en-
ergies for the sorbent, the sorbent following sulfation
and MgSO4 is consistent with the formation of some
type of sulfated magnesium species, while the data
for the Al 2p binding energies for the analogous com-
pounds is inconsistent with the formation of a sulfated
aluminum species. Infrared characterization ﬁnds
characteristic sulfate stretches in the 1300–850 cm−1
range, and a similarity of the IR spectrum to that
of magnesium sulfate. Taken together, these results
are consistent with reversible sulfation of magnesium
oxide-based sites on the spinel sorbent. Assuming
then that the magnesium oxide sites are sulfated, we
can calculate that the 54 wt% SO3 uptake noted in
Table 1 is consistent with sulfation of 71% of the
available magnesium oxide sites on the Mg2Al2O5
base. It is clearly advantageous to have a relatively
large number of accessible, basic sites for sorption.
2.3. Catalyst regeneration: reductive desorption of
sulfur species
Regeneration of the sulfated sorbent may be accom-
plished with several reducing gases, including hydro-
gen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, such as propane,
and hydrogen sulﬁde as illustrated in Fig. 2. The reduc-
ing gas of choice will depend on price and availabil-
ity for particular operating scenarios. Below, we focus
on reductive desorption of sulfur species using hydro-
gen as reductant. In this discussion and accompanying
thermodynamic calculations, we assume that the sul-
fated catalyst can be modeled by magnesium sulfate,
consistent with the characterization results presented
here.
The reduction step can yield SO2, Sn (n = 1–8), or
H2S as the sulfur-containing products of desorption.
Fig. 2. Sulfur species released open reductive desorption from
sulfated most catalyst.
At 1200◦F, SO2 is formed in large excess of Sn or
H2S, with a typical product split of 80% SO2, 10% Sn,
and 10% H2S. In addition to quantifying the product
split obtained upon desorption, the heat of hydrogen
reduction was also measured in a adiabatic reaction
study and calorimetrically via DSC. The measured
heat of reduction at 1200◦F is +11 kcal/gmol S,
and becomes more exothermic at lower temperatures
— at 1050◦F, the heat of hydrogen reduction is ca.
−5 kcal/gmol S, while the reduction is thermoneutral
at ≈1075◦F. These observations can be understood
by an examination of the reactions leading to these
sulfur products, listed as reactions 5–7 below. Thus,
formation of SO2 as the primary desorption product
would be endothermic, desorption of H2S as the pri-
mary desorption product would be exothermic, while
desorption of Sn would be closer to thermoneutral.
Utilizing the 80/10/10 product split mentioned above
leads to a calculated heat of reaction of +12 kcal/gmol
S at 1200◦F, which is in excellent agreement with the
measured heat of reaction of +11 kcal/gmol S.

In light of reactions (5)–(7), the reaction chemistry
which occurs during the desorption step can be better
understood by examining a DSC trace, shown below
(Fig. 3). The desorption step is endothermic during the
ﬁrst two-thirds of reduction, and becomes exothermic
toward the end of the regeneration. That the last part
of the regeneration is exothermic is consistent with

calorimetry.
liberation of primarily H2S, while the endothermic-
ity observed during the initial state of regeneration is
consistent with liberation of primarily SO2. Thus, we
can propose that the reaction network is one where the
primary product of hydrogen reduction is H2S. The
H2S thus formed reacts further with sulfated sorbent
to desorb Sn and H2S.
2.4. The MOST process
We have described in some detail the chemistry in-
volved in, and the catalyst selection for, the oxidative
sorption of sulfur species onto a promoted magne-
sium aluminate spinel, and the hydrogen regeneration
to liberate sulfur species and regenerate the metal ox-

ide catalyst. Here, we outline how these two steps are
used to construct the MOST process in toto.
As outlined above, conditions chosen for the oxida-
tive sorption step are 1000–1400◦F, with 1200◦F being
the preferred temperature. Streams suitable for treat-
ment include those containing mainly SO2 and H2S,
and also CS2, COS and CO. The SOx sorption is band-
wise, indicating that the limits as to throughput and
SO2 concentration can be higher than the 3500 GHSV
and 1% SO2 demonstrated in this contribution. Re-
generation was also discussed, and is possible with a
variety of reducing gases including hydrogen.
The overall process can be operated in ﬁxed
swing-bed reactors, a ﬂuid-bed reactor, or moving
beds. A process-ﬂow diagram for ﬁxed swing-bed
reactors is shown in Fig. 4. H2S laden streams, such
as amine treated acid gas and sour water stripper ef-
ﬂuent enter the Claus plant along with air. Most of
the sulfur is recovered in the liquid form. The tailgas
goes to a burner, where the remaining H2S is oxi-
dized to SO2 and SO3. Excess air is used, such that
the burner efﬂuent contains 1–4% O2. The burner
efﬂuent is shown going to sorbent Bed A, where
the SOx is adsorbed. The tailgas then proceeds to
the stack for atmospheric release. The regeneration
gas circuit is also shown in Fig. 4. Reducing gas,
diluted with steam, ﬂows through Bed B, to desorb
the sulfur as a concentrated stream of H2S and SO2,
which is fed back to the Claus unit. At the end of the
316

cycle, Bed A is loaded with sulfur, while Bed B had
its sulfur removed. At this point, valve positions are
changed, causing the tailgas to ﬂow through Bed B,
and regeneration gas to ﬂow through Bed A.
Sorbent performance over multiple cycles was also
investigated. Utilizing a reactor setup to simulate the
process as described above, catalyst was cycled be-
tween the oxidative sorption and reductive regenera-
tion modes for many cycles. At the start of this ex-
periment, the SOx uptake was 58 wt%, and following
210 cycles, the uptake was 42 wt%, which is commer-
cially acceptable. This is equivalent to roughly eight
months time-on-stream.
The Shell Flue Gas Desulfurization (SFGD) process
[8] functions in a similar manner to the MOST pro-
cess. The SFGD process is a dry sorbent-based process
for ﬂue gas SOx removal in which SO2 is oxidatively
sorbed onto a copper-on-alumina acceptor to copper
sulfate, and is reductively desorbed with hydrogen to
net mainly elemental copper and sulfur dioxide. SOx
loadings on this catalyst, however, appear to be sig-
niﬁcantly lower (<15%), a distinct disadvantage as
compared to the MOST process.
The regenerable SOx sorbents discussed here,
which also have CO and H2S oxidation capability,
may be used in applications other than Claus tailgas
treatment. For example, a ﬁxed-bed downstream of an
FCC regenerator might allow better SOx capture than
the current practice of circulating the sorbent with the
FCC catalyst. If an SOx sorbent bed was used to treat
the ﬂue gas from an oil or coal combustor, both SOx
and NOx emissions could be reduced. The sorbent
bed would serve to oxidize CO in the ﬂue gas, so
the combustor could be run with less excess air and,
hence, lower NOx make. Because of its simplicity, a
solid, regenerable sorbent/oxidizer may have use in
numerous other applications.
3. Conclusions
In this contribution, we present a novel pro-
cess/catalyst combination for reducing tailgas SOx
and H2S emissions to very low levels (1–5 ppmw).
The Mobil Oil SOx Treatment Process (MOST) con-
sists of the following steps:
(1) combustion of tailgas sulfur species to convert all
sulfur species to SO2/SO3;
(2) adsorption of SOx onto a high-capacity sorbent;
and
(3) in a separate step, reductive desorption of the sul-
fur as a concentrated stream of mainly SO2 and
H2S.
The MOST Process utilizes a regenerable promoted
spinel-based sorbent with very high SOx uptake capac-
ities (>50 wt%), and is both robust and operationally
simple.
