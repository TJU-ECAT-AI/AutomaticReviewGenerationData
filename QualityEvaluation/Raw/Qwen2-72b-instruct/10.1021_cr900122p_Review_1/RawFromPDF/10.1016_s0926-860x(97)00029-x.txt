Abstract 
This paper summarizes the main data appeared in the last years on the oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODH) of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The acid-base character of 
metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as 
the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide 
species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH 
of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading. In 
this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2~C4 
alkanes. The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide 
species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide 
catalysts are discussed. It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to 
develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions.

1. Introduction 
One of the driving forces of the refining and petrochemistry industry is the 
upgrading of cheaper feedstocks. In this line, selective oxidation reactions appear 
to be an alternative way to functionalize low molecular weight paraffins, in 
substitution of the more expensive olefins, to obtain oxygenated compounds. This 
is the case of the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on V-P-O 
catalysts [1-4], which is a clear example of an industrial process in the selective 
oxidation of paraffins, and, more recently, of the oxidation and ammoxidation of 
ethane and propane to the corresponding aldehydes, acids or nitriles [4-7].

On the other hand, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an 
attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations. In fact, the dehydrogenation 
of 
paraffins to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic 
process which has to be carded out at temperatures above 600°C. At the high 
reaction temperatures, other unwanted reactions leading to coke also occur, and the 
catalyst needs frequent regeneration. In oxydehydrogenation reactions, the 
abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing heat of reaction, and the conversion 
becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However one of the 
main points in catalyst optimization is to minimize the consecutive reactions. In 
this sense, a better understanding of the mechanism of the paraffin activation in the 
presence of molecular oxygen will be very helpful to develop new selective 
catalysts. 
Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a 
number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, 
the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective 
catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective 
catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]. 
The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength, 
better thermal stability and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of 
supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and 
the vanadium loading. In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short 
chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on 
other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins. This is the 
case of vanadium-magnesium 
mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity 
to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- 
zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH 
of ethane [33,34]. More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing 
molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during 
the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]. However, although several 
catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective 
sites is not well known yet. 
The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are 
usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species 
which can modify its redox properties. In order to better establish the influence of 
the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer 
systems (monomolecular 
dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by 
the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]. From these 
studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the 
catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, in spite of the 
variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the 
selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion. 
Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change 
with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic

results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium 
oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic 
systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia 
catalysts. 
1.1. Characteristics of supported vanadium oxide 
1.1.1. The dispersion of vanadium oxide 
Many supports [8-16] have been tested in order to modify the physico-chemical 
properties of single metal oxide, including: (i) metal oxides such as SiO2, TiO2, 
ZrO2, A1203 and MgO; (ii) mixed metal oxide, i.e., TiO2/SiO2 [40,41], TiO2/A1203 
[42], SIO2/A1203 [43,44], calcined hydrotalcite (Mg-A1-O mixed metal oxides) 
[45], sepiolite (Mg-Si-O) [46,47], A1NbO4 [48,49] and (iii) other type of 
materials, i.e. amorphous [50] or microporous aluminophosphates (A1PO4-5) 
[39,51] and MgF2 [52]. 
Although supported vanadia catalysts have been characterized by various 
techniques, i.e. FTIR, XPS, EPR, UV-vis, TPR, etc. [34-37,39,53-70], the major 
structural information about the nature of surface vanadium oxide species at 
monolayer and submonolayer covering the single metal oxide supports has been 
derived from Raman [60-64], solid-state NMR [64-67] and X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES) [68-70]. 
The results reported in the bibliography indicate that the dispersion of the 
vanadium oxide as well as its structure can be understood on the basis of the 
different acid-base character of the different supports. The acidity of the metal 
oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge (point 
of zero charge, pzc). Table 1 reports the isoelectric point or point of zero charge of 
several metal oxides which have been used as supports or promoters. From the data 
in Table 1 and other acidity measurements [53-56,71], the acid character of V205 
and the metal oxides more frequently used as support decreases as follows: 
V2Os>SiO2>TiO2=ZrO2>A1203>MgO, while the acidity of mixed metal oxides 
is intermediate between those of the corresponding single metal oxides [54,56]. It 
has been observed that the tendency of VOx species to be dispersed on the surface 
of the metal oxide support is related to its basicity, and decreases from MgO to 
SiO2 [54,57]. In other words, the agglomeration of vanadium oxide species to form 
V205 crystallites is favored with the acid character of the support. Moreover, the 
structure of the vanadium species depends on the acid-base nature of the metal 
oxide support [40,54]. 
In this way, while crystalline V2Os-like structures are obtained at relatively low 
vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer) on an acid metal oxide as 
SiO2 [61], metal vanadates are formed, at relatively high vanadium content and 
surface coverages of the support, on basic metal oxide supports [57]. These results 
can be explained by the acid character of the vanadium oxide (see above) that can 
easily interact and react with basic oxides, whereas a weaker interaction with

another acid oxide will favor the agglomeration of the VOx units to form V20 5. The 
importance of acid-base character of metal oxide support on the dispersion and the 
nature of metal anions have also been observed during the preparation of other 
supported metal oxide catalysts [54,58]. 
The addition of metal oxide as promoters or the presence of impurities on the 
support can modify the structure of the surface vanadium oxide species depending 
on their acid-base properties [40]. In this way, the use of zeta potential studies of 
catalysts and supports [53,58,59] by electrophoretic migration could help to 
understand some modifications observed on supported vanadia catalysts. 
The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement 
with their acid character. Thus, if a vanadium oxide monolayer completely 
covering the surface of the support would need 4.98 × 1014 molecules V205 cm -2, 
the appearance of V205 crystallites on A1203 occurs at vanadium loading of about 
60% of the theoretical monolayer, while a very thin layer of vanadia can be formed 
on TiO2-anatase at about the theoretical monolayer coverages [61]. A1- or Ti- 
vanadates are not generally formed in these systems. On ZrO2-supported vanadia 
catalysts, a rapid formation of multilayer structures has also been observed as a 
consequence of the weak interaction between the support and the dispersed

121 
vanadium oxide [40,72], although Zr2V207 are formed at vanadium loading 
exceeding the theoretical monolayer [73]. 
In order to increase the dispersion of the VOx species and avoid the formation of 
bulk V205 on more acid metal oxide supports, catalysts with different vanadium 
contents below the theoretical monolayer have been studied. As can be expected 
from the previous considerations, the dispersion and nature of the VOx species 
formed in catalysts with low V contents are also determined by the acidity of the 
metal oxide used as support. To simplify the description of the different type of 
tetrahedral V 
~+ species formed, in some cases we shall use the Q(n) notation, in 
which n refers to the number of neighboring VO4 tetrahedra linked through O 
atoms. 
Characterization studies on VOx/SiO2 catalysts (1-10 wt% [74] have shown the 
existence of isolated VO4 tetrahedra of the type (SiO)3V=O dispersed on the SiO2 
surface in dehydrated catalysts. Under ambient condition, the vanadium coordina- 
tion changes forming a hydrated surface phase in which the vanadium environment 
is similar to that of V205 [66,67,74]. This change has been explained by the acidic 
aqueous environment on hydrated silica on which vanadia species cannot be 
dispersed [74]. 
Isolated VO4 tetrahedra are also observed on catalysts supported on A1203, TiO2 
or ZrO2, at very low vanadium loading [59-67,70]. With increasing V content, VO4 
tetrahedra aggregates forming chains or bidimensional arrays. At higher surface 
coverages, the V 
5+ progressively becomes six coordinated in an environment 
similar to that of metavanadates or decavanadates. Upon dehydration the tetra- 
hedral coordination is favored together with other species on A1203 and TiO2, and 
quite complex 51V NMR spectra are obtained [65]. The appearance of V205 
crystallites is only observed at vanadium oxide coverages above 60 (A1203) or 
100% (TiO2) of the theoretical monolayer [61]. In fact, several studies carried out 
with Raman [40,58-62] and 51V NMR spectroscopy [64-67,75] indicate that, on 
both VOx]AI203 
and VOx]TiO2 
catalysts, the V-environment goes from tetrahedral 
at low coverages to octahedral at high coverages. 
On the most basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO-supported vanadia catalysts, 
isolated VO4 tetrahedra without bridging V-O-V oxygen ions (Q(O~ 
type) forming 
Mg3V2Os-like structures are observed within a larger range of V content [25-32]. 
Dimeric VO4 tetrahedra of the Q(1) 
type (MgzVzO7-1ike), 
and mixed ortho and pyro 
Mg vanadates have also been observed depending on the catalysts preparation 
procedure and/or the V-loading [25-31,67,75]. The V 
5+ species formed on MgO 
can be understood on the basis of the strong interaction between the V-atoms and 
the support leading to highly dispersed vanadium species at low coverages [75], 
and to the formation of crystalline Mg vanadates when the vanadium content 
increases. This is also observed on catalysts supported on basic metal oxides as 
La203, Sm203, Bi203 [57], in which the corresponding metal-vanadate is formed. 
A vanadium oxide dispersion intermediate between those on MgO and AlaO3 or 
SiO2 has been observed in catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite [45,75] and 
122 
T. Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 
on sepiolite [46,47,76], since they show an intermediate acid character [56]. 
Although the characteristics of the VOfitydrotalcite catalyst resemble that of 
VOx/MgO catalyst, the 51V NMR spectra suggest a higher heterogeneity of 
vanadium sites and tetrahedral V 
5+ species with different number of bridging 
oxygen ions (probably of Q(0~ 
and Q(~) 
types) [28,75]. Then, although a Mg3V208- 
like structure is mainly formed, also species of Q(I~ type like in pyrovanadates 
seems to be present. On the other hand, mainly dimeric V 5+ species are detected on 
the VOflsepiolite catalyst at low vanadium loading (a- and fl-Mg2V207) 
[28,46,47], while MgV206 and V205 are observed at high V-loading [47,76]. 
The presence of Mg-O-A1 and Mg-O-Si pairs, in addition to Mg-O-Mg pairs 
in calcined hydrotalcite and sepiolite, respectively, modify the interaction of the 
Mg-sites with the vanadium atoms leading to V 
5+ species different from those 
observed on MgO. Since the Mg/Si atomic ratio in sepiolite is lower than the Mg/ 
A1 atomic ratio in hydrotalcite, the number of Mg-O-Mg sites must be more 
abundant in the latter. The higher concentration of heterogeneous (Mg-O--Si) pairs 
in VOflsepiolite favors the formation of V207 units which are minority in 
VOflHydrotalcite [75]. 
The results obtained for vanadia supported on mixed metal oxides suggest that it 
is possible to control the structure and reactivity of the vanadia monolayers by 
modifying the local structure of the oxide support. This is the case not only of 
hydrotalcite but also of A1NbO4 [48,49] in which the presence of A13+ sites in a 
magnesia or niobia matrix, respectively, modifies the aggregation state of vana- 
dium species and finally its catalytic behavior. 
In this way, Matralis et al. [42] observed an important influence of the Ti/A1 ratio 
on the type of vanadium species in vanadia supported on mixed TiO2-A1203 
supports. Thus, for a given V-loading, the higher the Al-content (within the range 
10-82 wt%) is, the higher are both the catalyst surface area and the dispersion of 
vanadia. These modifications of the TiO2 support lead to the formation of 
monomeric vanadyl and polymeric vanadates species in VOx/(TiO2+AI203), while 
V205 is formed in VOflTiO2 catalysts. 
1.1.2. The stability of metal oxide support 
No significant effects of the preparation method and modifications of the support 
are usually observed on the structure of the VOx species in supported vanadium 
oxide catalysts [77] and this is mainly determined by the type of support. 
However, in some cases, the final surface vanadium concentration depends not 
only on the vanadium content, but also on possible modifications of the support 
during the impregnation and/or calcination steps. For this reason, we think that it is 
interesting to briefly summarize here the possible transformations of the metal 
oxide supports in processes involved in the catalyst preparation. 
The structure of TiO2 [78] and ZrO2 [79] can be transformed during the 
calcination step, and these modifications are generally enhanced in the presence 
of vanadia. In the case of TiO2 the use of different polymorphs (anatase, rutile, 
T. Blasco, ZM.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 
123 
brookite, B-phase) is not critical for partial oxidation reactions [80], although 
Slinkard and De Groot [81] found that the catalysts supported on rutile are more 
selective for the oxidation of n-butenes to acetic acid and acetaldehyde than those 
supported on anatase. However, different catalytic behavior during the ODH of 
propane is observed on catalysts prepared on ZrOe-tetragonal or on ZrO2-mono- 
clinic [82]. 
Modifications of the support during the calcination step are also observed in 
natural sepiolite or Mg-A1 hydrotalcite-like materials used as supports. In the 
former case, the initial Mg8SileOa(OH)4 crystalline phase is transformed into 
MgSiO3 in a degree which depends on the vanadium content and the calcination 
temperature [47,83]. In the latter case, A1203 is highly dispersed on amorphous 
MgO material [84]. These transformations observed in sepiolite- and hydrotalcite- 
supported vanadia catalysts, also occur in the absence of vanadium, indicating that 
the incorporation of vanadium oxide does not stabilize the crystalline structure. 
The hydrotalcite structure is partially regenerated in both cases if the calcined 
materials are rehydrated [45,84]. 
In the case of MgO some modification can occur depending on the preparation 
procedure [21,85]. MgO is transformed into Mg(OH)e when the impregnation is 
carried out in the presence of water. In these conditions, vanadium is partially 
occluded in the bulk of the catalyst after calcination, resulting in a lower surface 
vanadium concentration, as concluded from the differences between surface and 
bulk V/Mg atomic ratios [85]. Similar results have also been observed in 
MoOx/MgO catalysts [86]. 
Some modification of the support was observed on vanadia supported on 
microporous AIPO4-5 materials [39] or amorphous aluminophosphates [51]. In 
VOx/A1PO4-5 catalysts, the formation of amorphous materials (trydimite type) at 
vanadium loading of 2 wt% of V-atom or higher, not observed at lower vanadium 
loading or on pure A1PO4-5, indicates that the presence of vanadia favours a 
crystallinity loss of microporous material. However, the opposite trend is observed 
on vanadia supported on amorphous aluminophosphates (A1PO's) and a partial 
crystallization of A1PO-materials is observed at high vanadium concentrations 
[51]. 
We must indicate that in some cases, an attractive alternative to the conventional 
catalyst preparation procedure of supported vanadia catalysts can be the formation 
of non-stable crystalline phases. This is the case of V-containing hydrotalcite, in 
which vanadium is initially incorporated to hydrotalcite-structure, but after 
calcination, dispersed vanadia species are obtained [87,88]. 
1.2. ODH of short chain alkanes 
1.2.1. On the nature of active and selective sites 
Bulk vanadium oxide is known to posses a vast reservoir of oxygen which 
becomes highly mobile when the oxide is in a partially reduced state. Normally,

this mobile lattice oxygen is capable to achieve selective oxidation, but at the very 
high temperatures used for paraffins it can cause overoxidation [21]. From the 
results shown in Fig. 1, it can be seen that a low selectivity to oxydehydrogenation 
products are obtained during the oxidation of Ca--Ca paraffins on V205 [22-26], 
being higher during the ODH of propane, specially at low propane conversions 
[26]. 
When vanadium oxide is incorporated or mixed with magnesium oxide, an active 
and selective catalytic system in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28] and propane [26- 
31] is obtained. Mg vanadates, i.e. Mg3V208 and/or Mg2V/O7, are observed in the 
most effective catalysts suggesting that these are the active phases in the ODH of n- 
butane. However, lower activity and selectivity has been obtained with pure Mg 
vanadates and therefore, the nature of active and selective sites is not well know 
yet. 
Corma et al. [57] studied the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxide 
catalysts in the ODH of propane (Table 2). The most selective catalysts were 
obtained when vanadia was supported on basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO, 
Bi203, La203 and Sm203, 
while worse catalytic properties were observed for those 
supported on acid metal oxides (SiO2, TiO2, A1203), suggesting a parallelism 
between the appearance of Me vanadates (and the absence of V205) and the 
selectivity to olefins. Then, it was concluded that the use of basic metal oxides 
induced the formation of tetrahedral V 5+ species which could be considered as the 
selective sites in the ODH of alkanes.

c In the case of catalysts from [26] and [30], a part of vanadium is incorporated along the support, as was

catalyst can be considered. 
Comparison of the most effective supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the 
ODH of propane (Table 3), shows that, except in the case of VOSFiO2 catalysts 
which will be commented later, a higher selectivity is obtained at vanadium 
loading below that of the theoretical monolayer. In addition, for most of these 
catalysts, tetrahedral V 5+ species are proposed to be the selective sites in the ODH

Although the vanadium loading influences the catalytic behavior of supported 
catalysts, this influence also depends on the alkane fed. Fig. 2 shows the variation 
of the selectivity to olefins during the ODH of propane and n-butane with the 
catalyst vanadium content of MgO- and sepiolite-supported vanadia catalysts 
[76]. No substantial differences in the evolution of the selectivity with the V- 
loading are observed for propane and n-butane on MgO-supported vanadia 
catalysts (Fig. 2(A)). However, a more marked decay in the selectivity to olefins 
with the V content is observed during the ODH of n-butane on sepiolite-supported 
vanadia catalysts (Fig. 2(B)). In order to explain the different behavior of the VOJ 
MgO and VO~/sepiolite catalysts, we must consider the structure of the vanadium 
species on both catalytic systems. As has been commented previously, although 
tetrahedral vS+-species are present in both MgO and sepiolite supports, a higher 
degree of aggregation of the VO4 units occurs in the VO~/sepiolite. Thus, while 
V207 units in a Mg2V207 structure are already formed at low V-contents on

sepiolite, mainly isolated VO 4 tetrahedra in a Mg3V208-1ike structure is observed 
on MgO. Therefore, the catalytic results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that depending on 
the size of the reactant, the distance between the selective sites can influence the 
selectivity in the ODH reactions, as has been proposed by Michalakos et al. [94]. In 
this way, as n-butane is larger than propane, it can react with two adjacent VO4 
units (VO3-O-VO3) 
simultaneously on sepiolite supported catalyst, producing a 
deeper oxidation than when the reaction is carried out on isolated VO4 units (as in 
MgO supported catalysts). 
In order to explain the importance of the V-loading and thus of the VOx species 
on the selectivity to ODH reactions, Fig. 3 shows the variation of the selectivity to 
C4-olefins with the vanadium loading during the ODH of n-butane on supported 
vanadium oxide catalysts, using several metal oxide support: MgO, Mg-A1 
hydrotalcite, sepiolite and A1203 [28,45,46,87]. Small differences in the selectivity 
to C4-olefins is observed on VOx/MgO catalysts. However, on the other catalytic 
systems, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products strongly depends on the 
vanadium loading, and a maximum selectivity to C4-olefins at vanadium loadings 
of 30, 10 and 7 wt% V205 are observed on catalysts supported on hydrotalcite, 
sepiolite and A1203, respectively. While isolated and/or dimeric tetrahedral V 5+- 
species are formed on MgO- and Hydrotalcite-supported catalysts in all the V- 
range studied, octahedral VS+-species are observed on sepiolite- and alumina- 
supported catalysts at V-loading higher than 10 and 7 wt% V205, respectively. 
128 
T. Blasco, J.M.L Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 
These results suggest that besides the aggregation state of V 
5+ species also 
the coordination number affect the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium 
catalysts. 
However, if we only consider the coordination of vS+-species and/or the 
distance between two active sites as responsible of the catalytic behavior of 
supported vanadium oxide catalysts, it is very difficult to explain the different 
catalytic behavior of both SIO2- and A1203-supported vanadia catalysts during the 
ODH of n-butane and ethane. In fact, from the study of VOx/A1203 [95,96] or VOJ 
SiO2 [97] in the ODH of ethane, the highest selectivities to oxydehydrogenation 
products are obtained on catalysts with vanadium loading of 7 and 1 wt% V205, 
respectively. Although they show a good selectivity in the ODH of propane (i.e. on 
VOx/A1203 [93] or on VOJSiO2 [89]), a poor selectivity to C4-olefins during the 
ODH of n-butane is obtained on both VOx/A1203 [96,98] and VOx/SiO2 [14,15,99]. 
Isolated tetrahedral VS+-species of the (SiO)3V=O type has been proposed as 
selective sites in VOJSiO2 catalysts [14,15], while both isolated and polymeric 
tetrahedral V 
5+ species are mainly present on selective VOJA1203 catalysts 
[19,96]. Thus, the catalytic behavior of these catalysts must be influenced by 
physico-chemical properties other than the aggregation state of the VO4 units. 
One of the most important properties to be considered is the reducibility of the 
catalyst, as it can affect its catalytic behavior. In fact, it has been suggested that, in 
the case of metal vanadates, the catalyst reducibility determines the selectivity to 
oxydehydrogenation 
reaction in the sense that the more reducible the less selective 
the catalysts is [100]. However, no correlation between catalyst reducibility 
(considering the Tonse 
t in TPR experimentsFig. 4A) and selectivity to olefins in 
the ODH of n-butane is observed (Fig. 4B). Instead, the reducibility of the 
vanadium species are related with the catalytic activity (Fig. 4(A)), as has been 
proposed in other oxidation reactions [ 
13,16,61,69,102]. It seems logical to think 
that the vanadium oxide reducibility must be favored by a weak bridged V-O- 
support bond leading to an increase in the catalytic activity. Nevertheless, other 
catalyst characteristics have been related with the catalytic activity. In this sense, 
Busca et al. [101] found that the catalytic activity in butane conversion increases 
with the Lewis acid strength, i.e., (VO)2P207>VOx/TiO2>> Mg vanadate, while 
C4-olefins are only formed on Mg vanadate. 
Recently, it has been proposed that the differences in the selectivity to oxyde- 
hydrogenation reactions with the alkane fed could be controlled, in addition to the 
type of vanadium species [57], the reducibility of the active sites [101] and/or the 
distance between active sites [94], by the acid-base character of the catalysts 
[19,96,103,104]. If we compare the selectivity to olefins during the ODH of n- 
butane on supported vanadia catalysts with different acid character (Fig. 5), it can 
be seen that, at low n-butane conversion, the selectivity to C4-olefins is similar in 
all the catalysts studied, while at high n-butane conversion, the selectivity to 
oxydehydrogenation products progressively decreases from the catalyst with 
highest basic character (VOffMgO) to the most acid one (VOJA1203) (Fig. 4(B)).

Fig. 5. Selectivity to C4-olefins, at n-butane conversions of 10 and 40%, in the ODH of n-butane on supported 
vanadium oxide catalysts. Catalysts as in Fig. 4, experimental conditions as in Table 4. 
The hypothesis of the importance of the acid-base character of the catalysts in 
the ODH of ethane and n-butane has been recently confirmed from the results 
obtained on both pure and potassium doped vanadium oxide supported on A1203 
(Fig. 6) [96]. Vanadium oxide supported on alumina is active and selective in the 
ODH of ethane, but it shows a low selectivity in the ODH of n-butane. In an 
opposite trend, the K-doped catalysts are selective in the ODH of n-butane but they 
show a low selectivity in the ODH of ethane. Since the addition of potassium does 
not substantially change the type of VOx species formed, and its main effect is to 
decrease the number of acid sites, the different catalytic performance of the K- 
doped VO~/A1203 catalysts can be attributed to the variation in the acidity of the 
catalysts. 
A similar effect of the presence of alkali metal on the catalytic behavior of TiO2- 
supported vanadia catalysts [91,92,96,105] and nickel molybdate [106] in the ODH 
of propane and n-butane, respectively, have also been observed. The incorporation 
of alkali metal in supported vanadia catalysts decreases both the reducibility of 
vanadium species and the number of acid sites but increase the basicity of catalysts 
[91,92,96,105,107]. Moreover, the presence of alkaline or alkali-earth decreases 
the V=O stretching frequencies (and the cation polarizing power) in VOx/TiO2 
catalysts [108]. On the other hand, it has been observed that propene is only 
physically adsorbed on sodium-doped titania-supported vanadia catalysts while a 
reduction of vanadium sites is produced during the adsorption of propene on 
sodium-free catalysts [107]. Recently, it has been reported that the rates of 
reduction and reoxidation of alkali-doped VzOs/TiO2 catalysts, as well as the 
selectivity in the ODH of propane, decrease in the order: undoped>Li- >K- > Rb-

doped [ 
105], suggesting that the better catalytic behavior of doped catalysts could 
be related to a decrease in the heat of the propene adsorption. Thus, the presence of 
basic sites and/or the absence of acid sites could favor a higher propene desorption 
and/or a lower propene adsorption. If this is so, a similar effect can be expected in 
the case of the ODH of n-butane on alkali-doped alumina-supported vanadia 
catalysts [96]. 
On the other hand, and in contrast with the results found in the ODH of propane 
and n-butane, the presence of acid sites favors better selectivities to ethene during 
the ODH of ethane. Thus, in addition to silica- and alumina-supported catalysts, it 
has been observed that the presence of acid sites in V-containing molecular sieve 
enhances the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane [35,36]. Similar 
conclusions have been observed during the ODH of ethane on vanadium oxide 
supported on molecular sieve, in which the higher the acid character of the 
molecular sieve support the higher the selectivity to ethene [109]. 
Thus, from the considerations explained above we can conclude that both 
isolated tetrahedral V 
5+ species and dymeric and/or polymeric tetrahedral V 
5+ 
species are active and selective sites in the ODH of alkanes. However, the catalytic 
performance of supported vanadia catalysts will also depend on the distance 
between selective sites, the length of the alkane fed and the acid-base character of 
catalysts. The appearance of octahedral V 
5+ species (both isolated or polymeric 
species) favors the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the olefinic intermediate 
that, as will be explained later, can be transformed into selective and nonselective 
oxidation products [57].

1.2.2. Kinetic and mechanistic considerations 
In spite of the large number of paper devoted to the study of the catalytic 
properties of different materials, only a few of them consider the kinetic aspect of 
the ODH reactions [90,97,110-114]. According to the catalytic results obtained on 
several systems, a simplified reaction network, with parallel and consecutive 
reactions, can be considered (Scheme 1): in which K1, 1(.2 and K 3 are kinetic 
constants. In this reaction network, the initial selectivity to olefin (at low con- 
version of alkane) will be related to the K1/K2 
ratio while at high alkane conversion 
levels, the selectivity to olefins will be associated to the K1/(K2+K3) ratio. 
The variation of the selectivity to the oxydehydrogenation products with the 
alkane conversion were calculated for different constant ratios, considering a first 
order reaction [113]. The results, shown in Fig. 7, indicate that both the K2 and K3 
kinetic constants strongly influence the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation pro- 
ducts. In addition, selective catalysts can be obtained if the parallel (K2) and/or the 
consecutive reactions (K3) are eliminated or slowed down. 
Curves similar to those obtained experimentally on different catalytic systems 
can be constructed using different ratios of K's, which suggests the suitability of 
the reaction network shown in Scheme 1 to describe the ODH reaction mechanism. 
For instance, the experimental curves obtained in the ODH of C2--C4 alkanes on 
V205 shown in Fig. 1 are quite similar to those obtained for high K3/K1 ratios in 
Fig. 7, indicating that although olefins are initially formed, they are rapidly 
transformed into carbon oxides. Similar conclusions have been drawn from 
the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of propane on vanadium based 
catalysts [51] or on VOx/TiO2 (four monolayers of V205) catalyst, although in the 
last case, only the formation of propene and its consecutive reactions are 
considered [90]:

K3

As has been indicated in the previous section, the acid-base character of the 
catalyst has an influence on the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products. In 
order to determine how this parameter can affect the general reaction pathway, the 
C4-olefin distribution obtained in the ODH of n-butane on supported vanadia 
catalysts [28,96], summarized in Table 4, must be considered. A 1-butene : cis-2- 
butene : trans-2-butene ratio of ca. 2.5/1/1 similar to statistical equilibrium (3/1/1) 
is obtained on basic catalysts (i.e. vanadium oxide supported on magnesia, calcined 
hydrotalcite and K-doped alumina) while an olefin distribution similar to a 
thermodynamic equilibrium (1/1/1.1) is observed on acid catalysts (i.e., vanadium 
oxide supported on alumina or sepiolite) [28,96]. From these results it was 
concluded that the acid-base character of catalyst probably influences the rate 
of the parallel and consecutive reactions [28]. However, it is known that 1-butene 
can isomerize to 2-butene if acid site are present on the catalyst surface [ 
115,116]. 
Thus, the higher selectivity to 2-butenes on acid catalysts could also be favored by

determining step. A second H-abstraction is necessary to form olefinic inter- 
mediates that are subsequently desorbed as olefins: 
From the reaction network shown in Scheme 2, different selectivity-determining 
steps are possible: (i) the reaction of the surface alkyl species; and (ii) the 
desorption of the alkene [18,94]. Furthermore, in some cases, it is also possible 
the formation of alkoxides that can partially decompose to olefins on selective 
vanadium sites [12,101,117]. In other words, a high selectivity to olefins must be 
expected if steps 2 and/or 3 in Scheme 2 are rapid, while a deeper oxidation must be 
favored if they are slow. 
According to Dadyburjor et al. [10], the olefins (electron-donating molecules) 
have a higher basic character than the corresponding paraffins, and then they will 
interact more strongly with acid catalysts than with basic ones. At low n-butane 
conversions, this stronger interaction with acid catalysts will decrease the deso- 
rption rate of the adsorbed olefins (step 3 in Scheme 2) favoring the isomerization 
reactions (high selectivities to 2-butene) leading to a C4-olefins distribution closer 
to the equilibrium ratio, in agreement with the results shown in Table 4. For this 
reason, steps 2 and/or 3 have been be proposed as selectivity-determining step at 
low n-butane conversion, and the acid-base character of the catalysts determines 
the final C4-olefin distribution [ 103,104].

Fig. 8. Selectivity to olefins during the ODH of ethane, propane and n-butane on supported vanadium oxide 
catalysts. Catalysts: VO~vlgO (20 wt% V205); VOflMg-AI--O, (27 wt% V205 on calcined hydrotalcite), VOfl 
sepiolite (6.7 wt% V2Os) and VOffA1203 (7.0 wt% V205). Experimental conditions: T=550°C and an alkane/ 
OJHe molar ratio of 5/20/75 (n-butane) and 4/8/88 (ethane and propane); alkane conversion of 30%. 
At this point, the influence of the acid-base character of the catalysts on the 
selectivity to olefins at low conversions (Table 4) can also be extended to high 
alkane conversions. It can be expected that a stronger olefin adsorption on acid sites 
during the ODH of n-butane will favor the isomerization (at low alkane conver- 
sions) and the deep oxidation (at high alkane conversions). However, if olefins are 
adsorbed near to basic sites they will desorp faster leading to a higher selectivity to 
olefins, 
As is shown in Fig. 8 the catalysts that show high selectivities during the ODH of 
n-butane, i.e. catalysts with a basic character, show a low selectivity during the 
ODH of ethane, and vice versa on catalyst with an acid character. These differences 
could, in part, be explained considering the acid-base character of the alkane fed 
[103,104]. As the basicity of olefins increases with the length of the carbon chain, 
the olefinic intermediate formed from short chain paraffins, i.e. ethane, will be 
weakely adsorbed on acid sites, favoring its desorption and then a higher selectivity 
to olefins. It is clear that in some cases, a different mechanism can occur during the 
ODH of ethane, specially at high reaction temperatures in which homogeneous 
or gas phase reactions of the products can also be considered as competitive 
reactions [17-20,118]. On the other hand, as has been mentioned previously 
[18,94], alkyl species, specially from alkanes with four or more carbon atoms, can 
interact simultaneously with two V ions decreasing the selectivity to oxydehy- 
136 
T. Blasco, J.M.L. Nieto/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142 
drogenation reactions. This effect can also produce differences in the selectivity 
to oxydehydrogenation products in the oxidation of n-butane. In this way, the 
size of the reactants and the distance between the active sites must also be 
considered. 
A kinetic study of the ODH of n-butane on Cs-doped nickel molybdate led 
Madeira et al. [110] to propose that the formation of 1-butene and 2-butene from n- 
butane could take place through two intermediates formed on two different sites 
(observed by TPD of CO2) producing 2-butene and 1-butene in the less and more 
basic sites, respectively. 
Hydrocarbon adsorption experiments have been carried out in different catalytic 
systems. In this sense, a low adsorption of propane and propene on a submonolayer 
VOx/A1203 catalysts is observed [119]. Busca et al. [101] investigated the 
interaction of butane and butenes with selective V-based catalysts (Mg vanadate, 
(VO)aP207 and VOx/TiO2) by FTIR. An important aspect of these results is that a 
low adsorption of both paraffins and olefins is observed on Mg vanadate. In 
addition, they propose that the catalytic behavior of these systems depend on the 
efficiency of the different active sites present [21,101]: (i) Lewis acidic V centers 
acting as alkylic and allylic CH activation sites; (ii) OH's bonded to oxidizing V 
ions; and (iii) V=O which are oxygen insertion sites. In this way, the selectivity of 
the Mg vanadate catalyst, in the ODH of propane and n-butane, is in agreement 
with its soft acid character, the low number of OH and a weak V=O double bond 
character, while both (VO)2P207 and VOx/TiO2 that show a high selectivity to O- 
containing products (maleic anhydride and acetic acid, respectively, from n- 
butane) posses higher acidity and number of OH as well as a stronger V=O bond 
character. 
Fig. 9 shows the mechanism proposed for alkane activation on isolated VO4 
units [ 
18,21,120]. According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxida- 
tion of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary 
carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to 
the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H- 
abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation pro- 
ducts or carbon oxides. In this mechanism both the V=O double bond character and 
the strength of the bridging V-O-Me oxygen bond are essential factors in the final 
product distribution. In the case of oxydehydrogenation reactions (as is shown in 
Fig. 10 for n-butane), the second H-abstraction can occur from primary or 
secondary carbon atoms, which determines the 1-butene/2-butenes ratio in the 
case of n-butane. In addition to this, as the consecutive reactions can occur via allyl 
intermediates, a similar catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts is 
observed from both 1-butene [116,121] and n-butane. 
Finally, we must indicate that on most of the catalysts referred previously, olefins 
and carbon oxides are the main reaction products. Only in some cases, as the 
oxidation of ethane at low temperature on VOJSiO2 [12] or other vanadium based 
catalysts as V-Mo-Nb [24,25], oxygenated products can also be formed.

4 units. 
As has been previously commented, depending on the reaction conditions, 
vanadium species with a coordination number higher than four favor the formation 
of partial oxygenated products or carbon oxides [51]. Table 5 summarizes the 
catalytic behavior of vanadium based catalysts. The results reported in this Table 
show that the higher the coordination number and the aggregation state of 
vanadium species, the higher the O-insertion power is. In addition, the presence 
of V=O bond help to incorporate oxygen species into the hydrocarbon chain. 
However, olefins are formed at low n-butane conversions and high butane/oxygen

[1], the most selective catalyst in the oxidation of n-butane to 
maleic anhydride, indicating that the H-abstraction step also occurs [122]. In the 
selective catalysts in ODH reactions, that permit to obtain moderate selectivities to 
olefins at relatively high alkane conversions, mainly tetrahedral (isolated and/or 
dymeric) vS+-species are present. 
The importance of the coordination number of vanadium species on the nature of 
selective oxidation reactions can also be concluded from the results obtained, at 
low and high vanadium content, on both VOxJA1203 or VOx]SiO2. At low V- 
loading, they are selective in the ODH of ethane and n-butane. However, on 
catalysts with vanadium loading higher than 50% of the theoretical monolayer (in 
which octahedral V 
5+ species with V=O bonds as in V205 are mainly observed), 
T. Blaseo, J.M.L Nieto /Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 117-142

show a poor selectivity to olefins during the oxidation of ethane (COx are mainly 
formed) [95,97] or n-butane and n-pentane (in which maleic anhydride is mainly 
observed) [123]. Since, it has been observed that the selectivity to maleic 
anhydride during the oxidation of benzene [116], 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene 
[116,124] and furan [125] on supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases when 
increasing the vanadium loading (from 0 to 5 layers of V205) it can be concluded 
that V=O double bond is necessary for the O-insertion [17-21,116,120]. Similar 
conclusions have been reached in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on 
(VO)2P207 [1---4], or in the formation of acetic acid on VOJTiO2 [21,101], as well 
as in the formation of acrolein during the oxidation of propane on Mg pyrovanadate 
(MgeV2OT), with a V=O double bond in one of the adjacent corner-sharing VO4 
[29]. 
However, two adjacent V=O double bonds units are not necessary for obtaining 
not only oxydehydrogenation products but also O-containing partial oxidation 
compounds. In fact, it is know that n-butane [126] and n-pentane [127] are 
selectively oxidized to maleic anhydride using molybdovanadophosphoric acids 
as catalysts, in which isolated V=O double bond units are the active and selective 
sites. However, and in addition to the presence of V=O double bonds, the presence 
of acid sites are necessary on selective catalysts for the formation of O-containing 
product as they facilites the desorption of partial oxidation products. On selective 
ODH catalysts the presence of acid-base pairs can optimize the formation of 
olefins [104,105] 
In conclusion, supported vanadium oxide catalysts appear to be selective 
materials in the ODH reactions. Several factors can contribute to their catalytic 
behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of 
vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts 
and metal oxide support. The characteristics of the catalysts depend on the 
vanadium content and the nature of the support. 
The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very 
dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most 
selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in 
order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins. However, the 
presence of V=O double bonds, which occurs on catalysts with high vanadium 
content, appears to be responsible for the selective O-insertion reactions. 
The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic 
behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility 
of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these 
materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly 
depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to 
oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed. In this way, it appear 
that the rate of both the formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin 
desorption depend on the acid-base character of catalysts, and they can be 
considered as selectivity determining steps.
