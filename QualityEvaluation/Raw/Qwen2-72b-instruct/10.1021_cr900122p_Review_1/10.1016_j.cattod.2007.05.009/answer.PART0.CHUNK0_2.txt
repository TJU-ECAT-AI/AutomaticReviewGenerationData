[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[3] "The successful commer- cial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[4] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[5] "The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."
[6] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[7] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[8] "For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[9] "Some of these features may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the additional role played by structural defects, degree of crystallinity, etc."
[10] "Experimental evidence is often provided to indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them,depending on what the investigator is looking for."
[11] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s."
[12] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
[13] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
[14] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
[15] "It is also apparent that contradictory information derives from different experimental conditions, not so much regarding the procedure used for catalyst preparation and thermal treatment, as the conditions for catalytic tests."
[16] "The latter may vary greatly, and key operative parameters are not only the reaction temperature, pressure and contact time, but also the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane."
[17] "Very often oxygen-lean conditions are used, in order to obtain better selectivity to the olefin; this, however, implies that total oxygen conversion is reached and that, depending on the temperature, reactions leading to the formation of H2 may become significant."
[18] "Therefore, the redox properties of the gas phase (either reducing or oxidizing) with regard to the metal cations are greatly affected by these operative parameters."
[19] "This not only generates a dynamic situation with in situ modification of the active surface, but may also have implications on the reaction mechanism, even with a change in the rate-determining step of the reaction."
[20] "Furthermore, this may affect the gas-phase concentration of by-products and co-products (e.g., CO2 and H2O), the presence of which may substantially alter the nature of the cation oxidation state, degree of agglomeration, and type of interaction with the support."
[21] "This implies that reaction conditions may affect the nature of the catalyst character- istics."
[22] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C."
[23] "The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration."
[24] "(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C."
[25] "Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."
[26] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[27] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."
[28] "In fact, the olefin formation rate (per Vatom) is influenced by vanadia surface density and reaches its peak value at intermediate surface densities."
[29] "The initial selectivity ratio is affected by the surface density of active sites, thus suggesting that isolated structures prevailing at low surface densities are more selective for propane ODH."
[30] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx."
[31] "A high selectivity to propylene can be achieved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species;however, polymeric V species can be conducive to consecutive propylene combustion reactions."
[32] "Small V2O5 crystallites above single-layer surface vanadia cover- age do not contribute to propane ODH because of their low dispersion and small number of active surface sites."
[33] "It has also been reported that, in the case of propane ODH, the apparent activation energy for propylene combustion is lower than that for alkene formation and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."
[34] "This is due to the fact that the CH bond energy in propylene allylic C atom is weaker than the CH bond in the sec-C atom of propane, and the corresponding activation energy is also lower."
[35] "Thus, for low reaction temperatures, the consecutive oxidative attack on propylene has an advantage over the direct activation of propane."
[36] "Therefore, the highest selectivity of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operating at high temperatures that however avoid homogeneous reactions (e.g., lower than 550 8C)."
[37] "The same conclusion was reported by other authors, for reactivity tests performed in a multi-channel microreactor and with a V2O5-Al2O3 catalyst deposited on the reactor wall."
[38] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[39] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers;the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."
[40] "Surface oxygen, OH groups and,especially, oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains."
[41] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
[42] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[43] "Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re- oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[44] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[45] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[46] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[47] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[48] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
[49] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[50] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[51] "However, in this case,also, there are several contrasting indications in literature,and this is likely to be due to the different characteristics of the supports used and the different nature of the active species developed."
[52] "With a silica support, one major problem is the hydrolysis of the SiOV bond in the reaction environment, with a development of segregated vanadium oxide."
[53] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but apparently turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
[54] "Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure."
[55] "Conversely, Wachs and co-workers found that in propane ODH, turnover frequency (TOF) values vary by more than an order of magnitude with the specific oxide support for both the isolated and polymeric surface VOx species."
[56] "Therefore, the support may have a significant effect on the reaction parameters for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[57] "Evidence has been reported indicating that the O atom bridging V to the support may be the one participating in the catalytic cycle in isolated V species."
[58] "For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density."
[59] "An inverse trend was found between the steady-state catalytic TOF and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts."
[60] "The same was found in alkanes ODH; the more electronegative supports lead to higher activity, because the higher the difference between the electronegativity of active metal cations or support cations with oxygen, the stronger the bond."
[61] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[62] "For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densitiesonpure Al2O3supports."
[63] "The formation of VOCr and VOMo bonds occurs above Mo + V mono- layer coverages."
[64] "In titania-supported vanadium oxide, the increased selectivity is ascribed to the easier desorption of propylene from the less acidic surface, thus preventing the consecutive total combustion of propylene."
[65] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[66] "This implies that the lower the surface energy barrier for transfer of electrons from the catalyst to the reacting molecules is, the higher the selectivity is to the partial oxidation product."
[67] "It is argued that owing to the decrease in this energy barrier the re-oxidation step in the catalytic reaction is fast, thus preventing the presence of intermediate non-selective electrophilicoxygenspeciesonthe surface."
[68] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[69] "With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies which, in turn, are influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[70] "The relative propane ODH and propylene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces."
[71] "For instance, the observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propylene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[72] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[73] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[74] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
[75] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
[76] "On the contrary, selectivity to ethylene in the ODH of ethane does not depend on the acidic properties or on the MO bond strength."
[77] "Also, the basicity of the support may greatly affect selectivity; it is thought that the use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity because of the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx."
[78] "For instance, the addition of MgO to Al2O3 or the use of MgAl2O4 as supports for vanadium oxide positively affect the selectivity to propylene."
[79] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[80] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
[81] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
[82] "In many cases, site isolation has been achieved by simply depositing the active phase by impregnation over these high-surface-area supports."
[83] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15."
[84] "In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."
[85] "An inert matrix seems to be required in order to achieve high selectivities in the ODH of propane."
[86] "While acid materials are preferred for the ODH of ethane."
[87] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[88] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."
[89] "Vanadium species anchored to the surface showed structural properties similar to those on mesoporous VOx-MCM and conventional V2O5SiO2 catalysts, but a higher surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species could be achieved with the VOx-SBA-15 system."
[90] "Moreover, the authors hypothesized that the large pore diameter of the material might favor the diffusion of propylene outside of the pores, thus preventing deep oxidation."
[91] "There are many analogies between catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide and those based on supported molybdenum oxide."
[92] "More specifically, in the case of molybdena-based systems: In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[93] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."
[94] "Turnover rates are higher on two-dimensional domains than on isolated monomers,and increase as the MoOx domain size increases."
[95] "While the surface density further increases, TOF decreases as a result of the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3 crystallites."
[96] "The ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propane combustion reactions increases with increasing surface density and then remains constant."
[97] "The size of MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower ODH activity."
[98] "In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers."
[99] "The molybdena phase is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary overoxidation of ethylene to COx."
[100] "Loadings corre- sponding to higher than the monolayer coverage lead to a decrease in catalytic activity, due to the growth of Al2MoO4 crystallites."
[101] "Selectivity to ethylene increases when loading increases up to 15 wt.% and then remains constant."
[102] "The best catalytic performance can be achieved with highly dispersed two-dimensional molybdenum species, which fully encap- sulate the alumina surface."
[103] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
[104] "When the support is alumina, the latter produces the formation of oxygenates and full oxidation; the lower acid strength of molybdena (compared to alumina) permits the rapid desorption of the olefin."
[105] "Surface pathways were found to play a significant role, even at temperatures at which homogeneous reactions also occurred,thus indicating the possible occurrence of a heterogeneoushomogeneous reaction scheme at high temperatures."
[106] "In non-oxidative conditions,lattice oxygen activated ethane at the same temperature as in the presence of oxygen, leading mainly to ethylene production, since lattice oxygen was found to be less reactive to ethylene."
[107] "More labile forms of oxygen, resulting from adsorption of gas-phase oxygen on the surface, are probably responsible for the extensive ethylene degradation observed at high conversion levels."
[108] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."
[109] "Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li)."
[110] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
[111] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."
[112] "With zirconia-supported MoO3, potassium addition not only prevents crystalline Zr(MoO4)2 formation, thus suppressing the interaction of molybdenum oxide and zirconia phases,but also fosters the formation of three-dimensional molybdenum oxide and two-dimensional polymolybdates."
[113] "Both propylene selectivity and yield are enhanced thanks to a certain amount of added potassium."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a critical process for the production of olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, which are in high demand. Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking have limitations, leading to the exploration of ODH as a viable alternative. The performance of metal oxide-based catalysts in ODH is influenced by various factors, including the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. These factors can significantly impact the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The use of bulk metal oxides introduces additional considerations such as structural defects and crystallinity. The effectiveness of the catalyst is crucial for the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. The isolation of active sites is a key factor in designing efficient catalysts for ODH, as it can improve selectivity by preventing the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products.
2. The performance of catalysts in ODH is determined by multiple factors, including the nature of the active sites, the support material, and the reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, for instance, show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but the selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. The selectivity is influenced by the surface density of active sites, with isolated structures at low densities being more selective for propane ODH. The use of N2O instead of O2 can lead to a more reduced and selective surface. The support material also plays a significant role, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than those on alumina or titania. The addition of certain metal oxides can enhance the ODH rate and selectivity by affecting the reduction and catalytic properties of the active sites. Site isolation is crucial for improving selectivity, as it prevents the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products.
3. The ODH of alkanes is a complex process influenced by the catalyst's structure, the support material, and the reaction conditions. Catalysts based on vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide have been extensively studied. The activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with higher V2O5 loading, but the selectivity peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to a monolayer structure. The selectivity is affected by the surface density of active sites, with isolated structures at low densities being more selective for propane ODH.

The addition of metal oxides like CrOx and MoOx can enhance the ODH rate and selectivity by affecting the reduction and catalytic properties of the active sites. Site isolation is crucial for improving selectivity, as it prevents the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products. The ODH process is also influenced by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane, which can affect the redox properties of the gas phase and the reaction mechanism.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的关键过程，这些烯烃需求量大。传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化方法存在局限性，这促使人们探索ODH作为可行的替代方案。金属氧化物基催化剂在ODH中的性能受到各种因素的影响，包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子的价态以及固体的电子性质。这些因素可以显著影响催化剂的活性和选择性。使用体相金属氧化物会引入额外的考虑因素，如结构缺陷和结晶度。催化剂的有效性对于基于烷烃的化学过程的经济可行性至关重要。活性位点的隔离是设计高效ODH催化剂的关键因素，因为它可以通过防止中间产物的连续完全燃烧来提高选择性。
2. 催化剂在ODH中的性能由多个因素决定，包括活性位点的性质、支撑材料和反应条件。例如，支持的五氧化二钒催化剂随着V2O5负载量的增加显示出更高的活性，但对烯烃的选择性在中间负载量时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。选择性受活性位点的表面密度影响，低密度下的孤立结构对丙烷ODH更具选择性。使用N2O代替O2可以导致更还原和更选择性的表面。支撑材料也起着重要作用，二氧化硅支持的催化剂比氧化铝或二氧化钛的支持催化剂更具选择性。添加某些金属氧化物可以通过影响活性位点的还原和催化性质来增强ODH速率和选择性。位点隔离对于提高选择性至关重要，因为它可以防止中间产物的连续完全燃烧。
3. 烷烃的ODH是一个受催化剂结构、支撑材料和反应条件影响的复杂过程。基于五氧化二钒和钼氧化物的催化剂已经得到了广泛的研究。五氧化二钒催化剂的活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，但选择性在中间负载量时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构。选择性受活性位点的表面密度影响，低密度下的孤立结构对丙烷ODH更具选择性。使用N2O代替O2可以导致更还原和更选择性的表面。支撑材料，如二氧化硅、氧化铝或二氧化钛，可以显著影响选择性。添加金属氧化物如CrOx和MoOx可以通过影响活性位点的还原和催化性质来增强ODH速率和选择性。位点隔离对于提高选择性至关重要，因为它可以防止中间产物的连续完全燃烧。ODH过程也受到反应条件的影响，如温度、压力和氧气与烷烃的进料比，这些条件可以影响气相的氧化还原性质和反应机制。
