[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[3] "The successful commer- cial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[4] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[5] "For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[6] "Experimental evidence is often provided to indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them, depending on what the investigator is looking for."
[7] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[8] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[9] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities; therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[10] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[11] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[12] "The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers."
[13] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[14] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[15] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but apparently turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
[16] "Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure."
[17] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[18] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[19] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[20] "With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies which, in turn, are influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[21] "The relative propane ODH and propylene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces."
[22] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[23] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[24] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
[25] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
[26] "On the contrary, selectivity to ethylene in the ODH of ethane does not depend on the acidic properties or on the MO bond strength."
[27] "Also, the basicity of the support may greatly affect selectivity."
[28] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[29] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
[30] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
[31] "In many cases, site isolation has been achieved by simply depositing the active phase by impregnation over these high-surface-area supports."
[32] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15."
[33] "In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."
[34] "An inert matrix seems to be required in order to achieve high selectivities in the ODH of propane."
[35] "While acid materials are preferred for the ODH of ethane."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process that has gained significant attention due to the increasing demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene. Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking have limitations, such as thermodynamic constraints and coking, which lead to rapid catalyst deactivation. New technologies are needed to produce specific olefins without these disadvantages. The performance of catalysts in ODH is crucial, and the development of efficient catalysts is linked with innovative process designs. The reactivity of metal oxide-based catalysts is influenced by various factors, including the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. The reduction of vanadium during ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is dependent on the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene, with higher surface reduction leading to higher selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation is influenced by the ability of active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen to metal centers. The support plays a critical role in the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina-supported ones, which in turn are more selective than titania-supported catalysts. The identity of the support does not significantly affect turnover rates when differences in VOx structure are considered. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, with lower values leading to higher selectivity. The addition of metal oxides like MoOx and WOx can weakly adsorb propane, supplying catalytic active VOx sites for activation to propylene. Turnover rates are influenced by the reducibility of metal oxides, and the rates of propane ODH and propylene combustion depend on CH bond energy differences and adsorption enthalpies, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations. Additives like P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn, and Mo can modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in ODH. The isolation of active sites is a key factor in designing efficient catalysts for alkane ODH, and the substitution of active metal species into microporous and mesoporous materials is a promising strategy. However, maintaining the structure with high V contents and preventing the withdrawal of V species during the reaction are challenges. Site isolation has been achieved by depositing the active phase over high-surface-area supports, such as V-containing siliceous materials like MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15. An inert matrix is necessary for high selectivity in propane ODH, while acid materials are preferred for ethane ODH.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受到广泛关注的过程，因为对烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求预计将在不久的将来显著增加。传统的蒸汽裂解和流体催化裂解方法存在局限性，如热力学约束和焦化，导致催化剂快速失活。需要新技术来生产特定的烯烃，而没有这些缺点。催化剂在ODH中的性能是至关重要的，高效催化剂的开发与创新的工艺设计紧密相关。金属氧化物基催化剂的反应性受到多种因素的影响，包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子的价态以及固体的电子性质。在ODH过程中，钒的还原程度低于化学计量还原，催化显著的还原中心的数量取决于烷烃与氧气的比例。孤立和聚合的钒物种都是活性的，聚合的VO4物种被更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯的形成选择性，表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更选择性的表面。在CH键解离步骤中，活化复合物的稳定性受到活性氧化域将晶格氧原子的电子转移到金属中心的能力的影响。支持物在烷烃ODH中对钒氧化物的反应性起着关键作用，以硅胶为支持物的催化剂比以氧化铝为支持物的催化剂更具选择性，而后者又比以二氧化钛为支持物的催化剂更具选择性。当考虑到VOx结构的差异时，支持物的身份对周转率没有显著影响。二元分散结构的形成可以显著影响活性VOx域的还原和催化性质。丙烯的选择性可以与功函数值相关联，值越低，选择性越高。添加像MoOx和WOx这样的金属氧化物可以弱吸附丙烷，为丙烷激活为丙烯提供催化活性VOx位点。周转率受金属氧化物还原性的影响，丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧的速率不仅取决于CH键能量差异，还取决于吸附焓，反映了与氧化物表面分子键合的阳离子的路易斯酸性。像P、K、Ca、Ni、Cr、Nb、Mg、Au、Zn和Mo这样的添加剂可以改变支持的钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响ODH中的催化性能。活性位点的隔离是设计高效烷烃ODH催化剂的关键因素，将活性金属物种（如钒）替代到微孔和介孔材料中是一个有前景的策略。然而，维持高V含量的结构并防止反应过程中V物种的流失是挑战。通过在高表面积支持物上沉积活性相，已经实现了位点隔离，例如，V含量高的硅质材料，如MCM-41、MCM-48和SBA-15。对于丙烷ODH，需要惰性基质以实现高选择性，而酸性材料更适用于乙烷ODH。
