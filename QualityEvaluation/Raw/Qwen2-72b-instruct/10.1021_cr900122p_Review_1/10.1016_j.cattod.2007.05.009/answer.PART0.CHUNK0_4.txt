[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."
[3] "The successful commer- cial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[4] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[5] "For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[6] "Experimental evidence is often provided to indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them, depending on what the investigator is looking for."
[7] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[8] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[9] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities; therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[10] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[11] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[12] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
[13] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[14] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[15] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but apparently turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
[16] "Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure."
[17] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[18] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[19] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[20] "The relative propane ODH and propylene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces."
[21] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[22] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
[23] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
[24] "Also, the basicity of the support may greatly affect selectivity."
[25] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
[26] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[27] "An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide."
[28] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."
[29] "Vanadium species anchored to the surface showed structural properties similar to those on mesoporous VOx-MCM and conventional V2O5SiO2 catalysts, but a higher surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species could be achieved with the VOx-SBA-15 system."
[30] "Moreover, the authors hypothesized that the large pore diameter of the material might favor the diffusion of propylene outside of the pores, thus preventing deep oxidation."
[31] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[32] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."
[33] "The ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propane combustion reactions increases with increasing surface density and then remains constant."
[34] "The size of MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower ODH activity."
[35] "Loadings corre- sponding to higher than the monolayer coverage lead to a decrease in catalytic activity, due to the growth of Al2MoO4 crystallites."
[36] "Selectivity to ethylene increases when loading increases up to 15 wt.% and then remains constant."
[37] "The best catalytic performance can be achieved with highly dispersed two-dimensional molybdenum species, which fully encap- sulate the alumina surface."
[38] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
[39] "When the support is alumina, the latter produces the formation of oxygenates and full oxidation; the lower acid strength of molybdena (compared to alumina) permits the rapid desorption of the olefin."
[40] "Surface pathways were found to play a significant role, even at temperatures at which homogeneous reactions also occurred, thus indicating the possible occurrence of a heterogeneoushomogeneous reaction scheme at high temperatures."
[41] "In non-oxidative conditions,lattice oxygen activated ethane at the same temperature as in the presence of oxygen, leading mainly to ethylene production, since lattice oxygen was found to be less reactive to ethylene."
[42] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."
[43] "Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li)."
[44] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
[45] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."
[46] "With zirconia-supported MoO3, potassium addition not only prevents crystalline Zr(MoO4)2 formation, thus suppressing the interaction of molybdenum oxide and zirconia phases, but also fosters the formation of three-dimensional molybdenum oxide and two-dimensional polymolybdates."
[47] "Both propylene selectivity and yield are enhanced thanks to a certain amount of added potassium."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process aimed at producing olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, which are in high demand. The process faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the thermodynamic constraints of dehydrogenation and the tendency for coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation. New technologies are needed to overcome these disadvantages. Catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in the ODH process. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by various factors such as the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. The extent of reduction during ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. The selectivity to propylene formation increases with higher surface reduction. The use of alternative oxidants like N2O can lead to a more reduced and selective surface. The reactivity of the catalysts is also influenced by the support material, with different supports affecting the selectivity and activity. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the catalytic properties of active domains. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues, as it can prevent the consecutive total combustion of propylene and improve the selectivity to the desired olefin product. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors, and innovative process designs that link catalyst performance characteristics are essential for commercial success.
