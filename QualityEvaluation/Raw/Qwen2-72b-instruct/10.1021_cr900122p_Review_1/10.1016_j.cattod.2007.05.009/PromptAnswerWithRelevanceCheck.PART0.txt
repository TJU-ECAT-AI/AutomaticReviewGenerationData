1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. The reduction state of vanadium during ODH is lower than that observed in stoichiometric reduction, and COx formation is primarily attributed to adsorbed oxygen species. The support plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of vanadium oxide, and the formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the catalytic properties of VOx domains. Additives can modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, impacting catalytic performance. Site isolation is a key factor in designing efficient catalysts for alkane ODH, as it can improve selectivity. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 contributes to high selectivities in ethane ODH. Molybdenum-based catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, and the activation of the ethane CH bond involves the formation of alkoxides. Alkali additives can influence the structure and catalytic properties of MoOx domains.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂之间的复杂相互作用,包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。这些催化剂的性能受到金属阳离子聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子价态以及固体电子性质等因素的影响。在ODH过程中,钒的还原状态低于在化学计量还原中观察到的状态,而COx的形成主要归因于吸附的氧物种。支撑物在决定五氧化二钒的反应性方面起着关键作用,而二元分散结构的形成可以显著影响VOx域的催化性质。添加剂可以改变支撑五氧化二钒的酸碱性和氧化还原性质,影响催化性能。活性位点的隔离是设计高效烷烃ODH催化剂的关键因素,因为它可以提高选择性。VCoAPO-18中酸性和氧化还原位点的存在有助于在乙烷ODH中实现高选择性。基于钼的催化剂通常比基于五氧化二钒的催化剂活性低,而乙烷CH键的活化涉及醇酸的形成。碱金属添加剂可以影响MoOx域的结构和催化性质。

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，受多种与所用催化剂相关的因素影响。例如，对于支撑金属氧化物催化剂，金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子的价态以及固体的电子性质都会影响催化剂的性能。在丙烷ODH中，随着V2O5负载量的增加，钒氧化物催化剂的活性增强，但最佳性能是在中间大小的VOx域中实现的，这种域平衡了活性和可及性。对烯烃的选择性在中间负载量时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在乙烷ODH中，COx的形成主要归因于吸附的氧物种。在稳态ODH中，钒的还原程度低于化学计量还原，催化显著还原中心的数量由烷烃与氧气的比例决定。孤立和聚合的钒物种都是活性的，聚合的VO4物种在稳态烷烃氧化中被更广泛地还原。表面还原程度越高，对丙烯的选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更选择性的表面。在CH键解离步骤中，活化复合物的稳定性取决于活性氧化域将电子从晶格氧原子转移到金属中心的能力。支撑对钒氧化物在烷烃ODH中的反应性有重大影响，以二氧化硅为支撑的催化剂比以氧化铝或二氧化钛为支撑的催化剂更具选择性。二元分散结构的形成可以显著影响活性VOx域的还原和催化性质。对丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联，而次级表面金属氧化物添加剂可以增强丙烷活化为丙烯。在承载结构中掺入高钒含量有时会导致结构不稳定。VCoAPO-18中酸位点(与Co2+阳离子的存在有关)和氧化还原位点(与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关)的存在是实现乙烷ODH中高乙烯选择性的关键因素。支撑钼氧化物催化剂通常不如基于钒的催化剂活性高，无论使用何种支撑。丙烷ODH的每摩尔钼原子速率随着钼表面密度的增加而增加，直到达到4.5 Mo/nm2的样品；这种行为反映了表面钼物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo-O强度；更强的Mo-O键显示出较低的ODH活性。乙烷CH键的活化通过形成醇酸盐进行，醇酸盐分解为乙烯和表面OH基团，或被氧化为表面结合的氧酸(乙醛)。碱金属(铯、钾、锂)的存在影响MoOx域的结构，影响其电子和催化性质。这些碱性氧化物通过强化MoO键抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及局部还原钼中心的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。对二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时钼位点的较弱路易斯酸性；这解释了对丙烯的较高选择性。

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[7] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[8] "For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[9] "Some of these features may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the additional role played by structural defects, degree of crystallinity, etc."
[10] "Experimental evidence is often provided to indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them,depending on what the investigator is looking for."
[11] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s."
[12] "In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"
[13] "Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?"
[14] "Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?"
[15] "It is also apparent that contradictory information derives from different experimental conditions, not so much regarding the procedure used for catalyst preparation and thermal treatment, as the conditions for catalytic tests."
[16] "The latter may vary greatly, and key operative parameters are not only the reaction temperature, pressure and contact time, but also the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane."
[17] "Very often oxygen-lean conditions are used, in order to obtain better selectivity to the olefin; this, however, implies that total oxygen conversion is reached and that, depending on the temperature, reactions leading to the formation of H2 may become significant."
[18] "Therefore, the redox properties of the gas phase (either reducing or oxidizing) with regard to the metal cations are greatly affected by these operative parameters."
[19] "This not only generates a dynamic situation with in situ modification of the active surface, but may also have implications on the reaction mechanism, even with a change in the rate-determining step of the reaction."
[20] "Furthermore, this may affect the gas-phase concentration of by-products and co-products (e.g., CO2 and H2O), the presence of which may substantially alter the nature of the cation oxidation state, degree of agglomeration, and type of interaction with the support."
[21] "This implies that reaction conditions may affect the nature of the catalyst character- istics."
[22] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C."
[23] "The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration."
[24] "(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C."
[25] "Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."
[26] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[27] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."
[28] "In fact, the olefin formation rate (per Vatom) is influenced by vanadia surface density and reaches its peak value at intermediate surface densities."
[29] "The initial selectivity ratio is affected by the surface density of active sites, thus suggesting that isolated structures prevailing at low surface densities are more selective for propane ODH."
[30] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx."
[31] "A high selectivity to propylene can be achieved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species;however, polymeric V species can be conducive to consecutive propylene combustion reactions."
[32] "Small V2O5 crystallites above single-layer surface vanadia cover- age do not contribute to propane ODH because of their low dispersion and small number of active surface sites."
[33] "It has also been reported that, in the case of propane ODH, the apparent activation energy for propylene combustion is lower than that for alkene formation and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."
[34] "This is due to the fact that the CH bond energy in propylene allylic C atom is weaker than the CH bond in the sec-C atom of propane, and the corresponding activation energy is also lower."
[35] "Thus, for low reaction temperatures, the consecutive oxidative attack on propylene has an advantage over the direct activation of propane."
[36] "Therefore, the highest selectivity of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operating at high temperatures that however avoid homogeneous reactions (e.g., lower than 550 8C)."
[37] "The same conclusion was reported by other authors, for reactivity tests performed in a multi-channel microreactor and with a V2O5-Al2O3 catalyst deposited on the reactor wall."
[38] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[39] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers;the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."
[40] "Surface oxygen, OH groups and,especially, oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains."
[41] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
[42] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[43] "Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re- oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[44] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[45] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[46] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[47] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[48] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
[49] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[50] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[51] "However, in this case,also, there are several contrasting indications in literature,and this is likely to be due to the different characteristics of the supports used and the different nature of the active species developed."
[52] "With a silica support, one major problem is the hydrolysis of the SiOV bond in the reaction environment, with a development of segregated vanadium oxide."
[53] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but apparently turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
[54] "Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure."
[55] "Conversely, Wachs and co-workers found that in propane ODH, turnover frequency (TOF) values vary by more than an order of magnitude with the specific oxide support for both the isolated and polymeric surface VOx species."
[56] "Therefore, the support may have a significant effect on the reaction parameters for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[57] "Evidence has been reported indicating that the O atom bridging V to the support may be the one participating in the catalytic cycle in isolated V species."
[58] "For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density."
[59] "An inverse trend was found between the steady-state catalytic TOF and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts."
[60] "The same was found in alkanes ODH; the more electronegative supports lead to higher activity, because the higher the difference between the electronegativity of active metal cations or support cations with oxygen, the stronger the bond."
[61] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[62] "For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densitiesonpure Al2O3supports."
[63] "The formation of VOCr and VOMo bonds occurs above Mo + V mono- layer coverages."
[64] "In titania-supported vanadium oxide, the increased selectivity is ascribed to the easier desorption of propylene from the less acidic surface, thus preventing the consecutive total combustion of propylene."
[65] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[66] "This implies that the lower the surface energy barrier for transfer of electrons from the catalyst to the reacting molecules is, the higher the selectivity is to the partial oxidation product."
[67] "It is argued that owing to the decrease in this energy barrier the re-oxidation step in the catalytic reaction is fast, thus preventing the presence of intermediate non-selective electrophilicoxygenspeciesonthe surface."
[68] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[69] "With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies which, in turn, are influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[70] "The relative propane ODH and propylene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces."
[71] "For instance, the observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propylene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[72] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[73] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[74] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
[75] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
[76] "On the contrary, selectivity to ethylene in the ODH of ethane does not depend on the acidic properties or on the MO bond strength."
[77] "Also, the basicity of the support may greatly affect selectivity; it is thought that the use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity because of the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx."
[78] "For instance, the addition of MgO to Al2O3 or the use of MgAl2O4 as supports for vanadium oxide positively affect the selectivity to propylene."
[79] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[80] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
[81] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
[82] "In many cases, site isolation has been achieved by simply depositing the active phase by impregnation over these high-surface-area supports."
[83] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15."
[84] "In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."
[85] "An inert matrix seems to be required in order to achieve high selectivities in the ODH of propane."
[86] "While acid materials are preferred for the ODH of ethane."
[87] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[88] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."
[89] "Vanadium species anchored to the surface showed structural properties similar to those on mesoporous VOx-MCM and conventional V2O5SiO2 catalysts, but a higher surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species could be achieved with the VOx-SBA-15 system."
[90] "Moreover, the authors hypothesized that the large pore diameter of the material might favor the diffusion of propylene outside of the pores, thus preventing deep oxidation."
[91] "There are many analogies between catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide and those based on supported molybdenum oxide."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a critical process for the production of olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, which are in high demand. Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking have limitations, leading to the exploration of ODH as a viable alternative. The performance of metal oxide-based catalysts in ODH is influenced by various factors, including the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. These factors can significantly impact the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The use of bulk metal oxides introduces additional considerations such as structural defects and crystallinity. The effectiveness of the catalyst is crucial for the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes. The isolation of active sites is a key factor in designing efficient catalysts for ODH, as it can improve selectivity by preventing the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products.
2. The performance of catalysts in ODH is determined by multiple factors, including the nature of the active sites, the support material, and the reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, for instance, show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but the selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. The selectivity is influenced by the surface density of active sites, with isolated structures at low densities being more selective for propane ODH. The use of N2O instead of O2 can lead to a more reduced and selective surface. The support material also plays a significant role, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than those on alumina or titania. The addition of certain metal oxides can enhance the ODH rate and selectivity by affecting the reduction and catalytic properties of the active sites. Site isolation is crucial for improving selectivity, as it prevents the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products.
3. The ODH of alkanes is a complex process influenced by the catalyst's structure, the support material, and the reaction conditions. Catalysts based on vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide have been extensively studied. The activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with higher V2O5 loading, but the selectivity peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to a monolayer structure. The selectivity is affected by the surface density of active sites, with isolated structures at low densities being more selective for propane ODH. The use of N2O instead of O2 can lead to a more reduced and selective surface. The support material, such as silica, alumina, or titania, can significantly impact the selectivity. The addition of metal oxides like CrOx and MoOx can enhance the ODH rate and selectivity by affecting the reduction and catalytic properties of the active sites. Site isolation is crucial for improving selectivity, as it prevents the consecutive total combustion of intermediate products. The ODH process is also influenced by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane, which can affect the redox properties of the gas phase and the reaction mechanism.

The identity of the support does not significantly affect turnover rates when differences in VOx structure are considered. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, with lower values leading to higher selectivity. The addition of metal oxides like MoOx and WOx can weakly adsorb propane, supplying catalytic active VOx sites for activation to propylene. Turnover rates are influenced by the reducibility of metal oxides, and the rates of propane ODH and propylene combustion depend on CH bond energy differences and adsorption enthalpies, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process aimed at producing olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, which are in high demand. The process faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion due to the thermodynamic constraints of dehydrogenation and the tendency for coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation. New technologies are needed to overcome these disadvantages. Catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in the ODH process. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by various factors such as the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. The extent of reduction during ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. The selectivity to propylene formation increases with higher surface reduction. The use of alternative oxidants like N2O can lead to a more reduced and selective surface. The reactivity of the catalysts is also influenced by the support material, with different supports affecting the selectivity and activity. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the catalytic properties of active domains. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues, as it can prevent the consecutive total combustion of propylene and improve the selectivity to the desired olefin product. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors, and innovative process designs that link catalyst performance characteristics are essential for commercial success.
