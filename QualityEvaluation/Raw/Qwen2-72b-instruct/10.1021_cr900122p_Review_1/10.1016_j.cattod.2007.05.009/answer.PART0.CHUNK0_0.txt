[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[3] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
[4] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[7] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[8] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[9] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[10] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
[11] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. The reduction state of vanadium during ODH is lower than that observed in stoichiometric reduction, and COx formation is primarily attributed to adsorbed oxygen species. The support plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of vanadium oxide, and the formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the catalytic properties of VOx domains. Additives can modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, impacting catalytic performance. Site isolation is a key factor in designing efficient catalysts for alkane ODH, as it can improve selectivity. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 contributes to high selectivities in ethane ODH. Molybdenum-based catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, and the activation of the ethane CH bond involves the formation of alkoxides. Alkali additives can influence the structure and catalytic properties of MoOx domains.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂之间的复杂相互作用,包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。这些催化剂的性能受到金属阳离子聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子价态以及固体电子性质等因素的影响。在ODH过程中,钒的还原状态低于在化学计量还原中观察到的状态,而COx的形成主要归因于吸附的氧物种。支撑物在决定五氧化二钒的反应性方面起着关键作用,而二元分散结构的形成可以显著影响VOx域的催化性质。添加剂可以改变支撑五氧化二钒的酸碱性和氧化还原性质,影响催化性能。活性位点的隔离是设计高效烷烃ODH催化剂的关键因素,因为它可以提高选择性。VCoAPO-18中酸性和氧化还原位点的存在有助于在乙烷ODH中实现高选择性。基于钼的催化剂通常比基于五氧化二钒的催化剂活性低,而乙烷CH键的活化涉及醇酸的形成。碱金属添加剂可以影响MoOx域的结构和催化性质。
