[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[3] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."
[4] "The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH."
[5] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[6] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[7] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[8] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[9] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[10] "The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers."
[11] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[12] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[13] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[14] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[15] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[16] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
[17] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[18] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[19] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."
[20] "The size of MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower ODH activity."
[21] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."
[22] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."
[23] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
[24] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to the catalysts used. Supported metal oxide catalysts, for instance, are affected by the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation, and the electronic properties of the solid. In propane ODH, vanadium oxide catalysts show increased activity with higher V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved with intermediate-sized VOx domains that balance activity and accessibility. Selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate loadings, corresponding to the development of a monolayer structure. COx formation in ethane ODH is mainly due to adsorbed oxygen species. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state ODH is lower than stoichiometric reduction, and the number of catalytically significant reduced centers is determined by the alkane-to-oxygen ratio. Both isolated and polymeric vanadium species are active, with polymerized VO4 species being more extensively reduced. Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity to propylene. The use of N2O instead of O2 results in a more reduced and selective surface. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation depends on the electron transfer capability of the active oxide domains. The support significantly influences the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH, with silica-supported catalysts being more selective than alumina or titania. The formation of binary dispersed structures can significantly affect the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains. Selectivity to propylene can be correlated with work function values, and secondary surface metal oxide additives can enhance propane activation to propylene. Incorporating high vanadium contents in hosting structures can sometimes lead to structural instability. The presence of both acid and redox sites in VCoAPO-18 is crucial for high selectivity to ethylene in ethane ODH. Supported molybdenum oxide catalysts are generally less active than vanadia-based catalysts, with propane ODH rates increasing with Mo surface density up to a certain point. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo-O strength, with stronger bonds showing lower ODH activity. The activation of ethane CH bonds forms alkoxides that decompose to ethylene or are oxidized to oxygenates. Alkali additives affect the structure of MoOx domains, influencing their electronic and catalytic properties, and can inhibit the reduction of MoOx, affecting the CH bond activation step and leading to higher selectivity to propylene.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，受多种与所用催化剂相关的因素影响。例如，对于支撑金属氧化物催化剂，金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、金属阳离子的价态以及固体的电子性质都会影响催化剂的性能。在丙烷ODH中，随着V2O5负载量的增加，钒氧化物催化剂的活性增强，但最佳性能是在中间大小的VOx域中实现的，这种域平衡了活性和可及性。对烯烃的选择性在中间负载量时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在乙烷ODH中，COx的形成主要归因于吸附的氧物种。在稳态ODH中，钒的还原程度低于化学计量还原，催化显著还原中心的数量由烷烃与氧气的比例决定。孤立和聚合的钒物种都是活性的，聚合的VO4物种在稳态烷烃氧化中被更广泛地还原。表面还原程度越高，对丙烯的选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更选择性的表面。在CH键解离步骤中，活化复合物的稳定性取决于活性氧化域将电子从晶格氧原子转移到金属中心的能力。支撑对钒氧化物在烷烃ODH中的反应性有重大影响，以二氧化硅为支撑的催化剂比以氧化铝或二氧化钛为支撑的催化剂更具选择性。二元分散结构的形成可以显著影响活性VOx域的还原和催化性质。对丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联，而次级表面金属氧化物添加剂可以增强丙烷活化为丙烯。在承载结构中掺入高钒含量有时会导致结构不稳定。VCoAPO-18中酸位点(与Co2+阳离子的存在有关)和氧化还原位点(与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关)的存在是实现乙烷ODH中高乙烯选择性的关键因素。支撑钼氧化物催化剂通常不如基于钒的催化剂活性高，无论使用何种支撑。丙烷ODH的每摩尔钼原子速率随着钼表面密度的增加而增加，直到达到4.5 Mo/nm2的样品；这种行为反映了表面钼物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo-O强度；更强的Mo-O键显示出较低的ODH活性。乙烷CH键的活化通过形成醇酸盐进行，醇酸盐分解为乙烯和表面OH基团，或被氧化为表面结合的氧酸(乙醛)。碱金属(铯、钾、锂)的存在影响MoOx域的结构，影响其电子和催化性质。这些碱性氧化物通过强化MoO键抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及局部还原钼中心的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。对二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时钼位点的较弱路易斯酸性；这解释了对丙烯的较高选择性。
