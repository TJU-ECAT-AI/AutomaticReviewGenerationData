Rodriguez Departamento de Ingenier a Qu mica, Facultad de Ciencias Qu micas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real 13004, Spain Received 14 December 1998; received in revised form 6 April 1999; accepted 7 April 1999 Abstract Two samples of silica with different surface area have been used in the preparation of silica-supported tungsten oxide catalysts with W loading ranging from 0.8 to 15.8 wt%. Both catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure. It has been shown that both surface area and tungsten loading affect the nature and dispersion of the tungsten oxide species and, therefore, the catalytic behavior of the samples. Poor dispersion and high reducibility of the tungsten oxide phase is observed for the low surface area catalysts, thus leading to a high activity per unit area in methane conversion. High surface catalysts show a well-dispersed and hardly reducible tungsten oxide overlayer that covers the active sites of the silica surface. Consequently, a negative effect on the catalytic activity is observed. Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present on the W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites and WOW functionalities. These results agree with those previously reported by the authors for W/HZSM-5 catalysts. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates at atmospheric pressures has been widely studied in the last years. Among a great variety of catalysts employed, silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 have been reported to be the most active in formaldehyde pro- duction [1]. Likewise, other carriers such as TiO2 [2 4] and SnO2 [4] have been used, the results achieved being poorer. One of the reasons for the good catalytic performance of silica based catalysts is the ability of the bare silica to yield HCOH in methane oxidation.
Among different commercial silica, the best yields have been obtained with precipitated'' SiO2 [5,6].Several works have focused on the establishment of the relationship between metal oxide overlayer struc- ture and its role in the reaction mechanism. Thus,some factors such as catalyst reducibility [710] and density of different type of active sites [2,3,1113] have been correlated to the catalytic behavior. It has been shown that the catalytic properties of silica supported MoO3 and V2O5 are strongly affected by the interaction between metal oxide species and sup- port which in turn controls both reducibility and dispersion of the active phase. Recently, Parmaliana et al. [10] have shown the inuence of metal oxide Applied Catalysis A: General 184 (1999) 143152 *Corresponding author.

loading on the mechanism of the reaction. However,despite the literature reported, there is practically no paper in which the simultaneous inuence of both silica surface area and metal oxide loading on the catalytic pattern is specically studied.
On the other hand, several authors have shown the chemical similarities existing between MoO3 and WO3 overlayers in silica and alumina supported cat- alysts [1517]. Specically, Salvati et al. [15] showed that WO3/Al2O3 catalysts were structurally similar to MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts and that the WO4 2 interaction species closely resembled the molybdenumalumina surface complex. In spite of this fact and the high stability of tungsten oxide, there are, however, few works reporting the use of tungsten oxide based catalysts in the methane partial oxidation. Ban ares et al. [7] employed MOx/SiO2 catalysts (MV, Mo, W and Re) in the title reaction showing that tungsten oxide phase was active in formaldehyde production. In a previous work [14], the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as an oxi- dant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts. Three different types of supported species were detected:tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. Furthermore, it was shown that HCOH selectivity seemed to be dependent on both dispersion and nature of the tungsten species over the catalyst.
The aim of this paper is
1. to check the effect of surface area of the silica
carrier and tungsten loading on the structure of the supported oxide phase;
2. to relate it to the observed catalytic behavior; and
3. to compare the results obtained to those previously
reported for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Two precipitated silica samples were used in this work. One with surface area of 55 m2/g (Probus) will be named as LSiO2 and another one with surface area of 400 m2/g (BDH) will be referred to as HSiO2. Both samples were used as received. Two series of tungsten catalysts were respectively prepared by aqueous impregnation of the silica powder with different amounts of ammonium metatungstate (Aldrich) to give tungsten loading in the range 0.815.8 wt%.
After water removal from a rotary evaporator, the impregnated were calcined in air at 6758C for 2.5 h.
The catalysts prepared from low and high surface area silica are named as LSiWx and HSiWx, respectively, x indicating the weight percentage of tungsten in the catalyst.
2.2. Catalytic runs
Methane conversion tests were performed at atmo- spheric pressure in a quartz tubular ow reactor (the dimensions of the reaction zone were i.d. 21.4 mm,length 60 mm). Other components of the reaction system were a gas feed system for each reactive (methane and oxygen), with an individual control by mass ow meters and an exit gas ow meter. Three heating zones surrounded the reactor. The temperature of each zone was independently controlled within 18C by temperature controllers. A thermocouple was placed in the center of the bed in order to measure the reaction temperature. With this reactor design, a variation of only 58C was observed along the cat- alytic bed. All the products were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and two columns:a Porapak Q column to separate CH4, CO2, COO2, HCOH and water and a molecular sieve 5A packed column to separate CO and O2. Formaldehyde cali- bration was obtained with 40% HCOH aqueous solu- tion.
In all experiments catalyst samples were pretreated in situ'' in an oxygen ow from the ambient tem- perature to the reaction temperature, 6508C, and held at the latter approximately for 1 h. Space velocity of the feed was 7.41 g h mol1 and the CH4:O2 molar ratio was 5.3:1. It was proven that approximately 2 h were required to reach apparently steady conditions.Sampling of the product stream was repeated until the analytical results were reproducible. In the present research, the carbon balance is always better than 97%.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area and micropore volumes of the calcined samples were measured by using a Quanta- 144

chrome Autosorb-1 apparatus with nitrogen as the adsorbate (N2 molecule surface16.2 A 2). X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a Philips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu K radiation. H2- temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measure- ments were performed on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples (usually 0.035 g) were pre- treated from ambient temperature to 6758C in argon ow. Following pretreatment, the samples were cooled at room temperature and the gas switched to 17% H2 in argon mixture. The gas ow was 50 Ncm3/min and the temperature was raised at 108C/min from ambient temperature to 9008C. During this time the exit gas was monitored using a TCD detector. The unique area under the curve was integrated to evaluate the hydrogen consumption.
The relative reducibility values of the samples,expressed as (mol H2 consumed/mol W of sample)/ (mol H2 consumed/mol W of WO3), were calculated by comparison with the amount of hydrogen con- sumed by a WO3 sample (Merck). UV diffuse reec- tance spectra (UV DRS) were performed by using Spectralon as a reference on a Perkin Elmer Lambda- 20 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reectance accessory. The spectra were recorded immediately after calcination of the samples. The scanning wave- length range was 198500 nm and the scan speed was 120 nm/min.
3. Results
3.1. Structure of the supported tungsten species
BET surface areas of the two series of W/SiO2 catalysts are listed in Table 1, showing a surface area decrease with increasing amounts of tungsten in both catalyst series. This fact is analogous to that observed for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14]. Likewise, in Table 1 are shown the surface concentration values of the catalysts in terms of atoms of tungsten per nm2,assuming 100% dispersion. According to Salvati et al. [15], the theoretical monolayer coverage in tungsten oxide catalysts is reached for 4.3 W atoms per nm2. It can be seen for LSiW catalyst series that silica surface would be completely covered for
7.1 wt% W loading and above. In contrast, for the
high area silica the theoretical monolayer coverage is not reached in any case.
The UV diffuse reectance spectra of the LSiWand HSiW catalyst series are shown in Figs. 1 and 2,respectively. The spectrum of LSiW 0.8 catalyst is not shown in Fig. 1 because of the low absorbance values obtained. Three bands can be seen in these spectra. A major band in the range 250325 nm can be observed for all the catalysts with W loading higher than 0.8 wt%. This band is more intense for HSiW samples. The UV DRS spectrum of HSiW 0.8 shows a single band at 220 nm, this band appearing as a shoulder for the rest of the samples. Finally, a third band at about 375400 nm can be seen for W loading above 4.0 and 7.1 wt% in the LSiW and in HSiW catalysts, respectively. The relative intensity of the different bands is dependent on both the support and W loading. According to a previous work [14] these three bands can be assigned as follows: the 220 nm band, to tetrahedral monomeric tungstate species; the 250325 nm one, to octahedral polytungstate species;and the 375400 nm band, to WO3 crystallites. There- fore, it can be said that these three types of tungsten species exist in W/SiO2 catalysts. Several authors have described these three tungsten species in silica, alu- Table 1 BET surface areas and tungsten surface concentration of the W/SiO2 catalyst series with different tungsten loading Catalyst (low surface area) BET (N2) surface area (m2/g) Surface coverage at W (nm2)a Catalyst (high surface area) BET (N2) surface area (m2/g) Surface coverage at W (nm2)a LSiO2 55

In Figs. 3 and 4 the XRD patterns of the two catalyst series are shown. In both the gures, the XRD pattern of crystalline WO3 is included for com- parison. For LSiW catalysts, peaks corresponding to the presence of a crystalline WO3 phase begin to appear at W loading of 4.0 wt%, their intensity increasing with the tungsten loading. In HSiW cata- lysts, the presence of crystallites of WO3 is only detected for the highest W loading. Since a minimum size of the crystal (50 A ) is required for XRD detection these results are in good agreement with those obtained by diffuse reectance.
The TPR curves for the two catalyst series and the bulk WO3 in the range 3009008C are comparatively shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The TPR prole of bulk WO3 exhibits two peaks with maxima at 6558C and 7408C.

These peaks may be assigned to the step-wise reduc- tion of WO3 to W0 (WVI ! WIV ! W0). As seen in Fig. 5, the TPR patterns of LSiW catalysts (with except of LSiW 0.8) present two peaks at 6308C and 7107508C which monotonically increase in intensity with W loading. These peaks seem to corre- spond with the peaks of the WO3 TPR prole. This fact would indicate a poor dispersion of the tungsten oxide species on the low surface silica [3]. This idea is supported by the high relative reducibility values obtained (Fig. 7) which are very similar to that of the bulk tungsten oxide. These results agree with those obtained with UV diffuse reectance spectroscopy and XRD.
On the other hand, the TPR patterns of HSiW catalysts (Fig. 6) with tungsten loading up to
7.1 wt% do not show any hydrogen consumption up
to ca. 8508C. For the HSiW 4.0 and HSiW 7.1 catalysts a broad peak with very low intensity can be seen at 8708C and 8508C, respectively. The TPR curve of the HSiW 11.9 catalyst shows three unre- solved weak peaks at 5306058C, 7048C, 8038C. The HSiW 15.8 catalyst exhibit a TPR prole consisting of two major overlapped peaks at 5206058C and 6988C together with a small peak at 8078C. Peaks at 520 6058C and 7008C of the HSiW 11.9 and HSiW 15.8 catalysts seem to correspond again with those of the bulk WO3. The highest temperature peak may be attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed tungsten species [3]. The shift of this peak towards lower temperatures, occurring at higher W loading, reects an improved reducibility of dispersed species, likely enabled by the autocatalytic effect'' exerted by the increased tungsten concentration [3]. The low relative reducibility values of the HSiW catalysts (Fig. 7) would indicate the existence of a strong interaction between the supported phase and the silica surface leading to a good dispersion of the tungsten species.Fig. 5.

3.2. Methane oxidation
Formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and water are the unique products obtained in the partial oxidation of methane over W/SiO2 catalysts. Catalytic results for the LSiW and HSiW catalysts are summar- ized in Table 2.
A blank experiment using a CSi bed was performed in order to evaluate the signicance of the homoge- neous reaction in the pre-heated zone of the reactor. A methane conversion of 0.8 mol% was obtained,carbon oxides being the unique products formed (mainly CO2). The contribution of the homogeneous reaction was not taken into account in the methane conversion values since it is equal for all the runs.
The two bare precipitated silica samples lead to similar methane conversion values, although the high surface area silica exhibits a higher selectivity to formaldehyde. Likewise, it can be noted that for the LSiW catalysts methane conversion changes slightly with the tungsten loading.
Fig. 8 shows the selectivity of HCOH, CO and CO2 vs. methane conversion. Despite the great variation in surface area, both tungsten catalyst series show several common features:
1. formaldehyde selectivity values are quite similar;
2. carbon dioxide is the predominant oxidation pro-
duct; and
3. HCOH and CO2 selectivity exhibit a similar trend
that it is complementary to that of the CO one,indicating that CO proceeds in some extent from a further oxidation of HCOH.
This latter finding has been reported by several authors for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [2022]. Nevertheless, a remarkable difference can be noted: while for the LSiW series HCOH and CO2 selectivities increase with methane conversion, for the HSiW catalysts an opposite effect is seen.
Although the formaldehyde selectivity and STY (spacetime yield) values obtained are too low for a possible industrial application of the process, they are in the same order of magnitude than other data pre- viously reported for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [1,4,6,9,27].
4. Discussion
4.1. Nature of the supported tungsten oxide phase
As noted in Section 1 the similarity existing between WO3 and MoO3 is reected in the structure of the overlayers that both oxides form over supported catalysts [1517]. Several authors have reported that the structure of the supported phase of W/SiO2 and Mo/SiO2 catalysts follows the metal oxide aqueous chemistry as a function of the net surface pH at point Table 2 Methane conversion and product selectivities for methane partial oxidation over the two series of W/SiO2 catalysts Catalyst CH4 conversion (mol%) Selectivity (mol%)

of zero charge (PZC) [17,23,24]. Above a W concen- tration of 0.1 M, aqueous tungstate anions exist in two structures: a tetrahedrally coordinated WO4 2 anion and an octahedrally coordinated W12 polyoxoanion.
The equilibrium between these two species is described by:
12WO2
4
12H@W12O12
42
6H2O
In alkaline solutions the tungstate monomer is the predominant species and is stable in neutral solutions.
The polytungstate species is present at pH 78 and is the predominant one in acidic solutions. The silica support possesses an acidic pH at PZC (pH4) and the addition of the tungsten oxide leads to a further decrease of the surface net pH at PZC for the W/ SiO2 catalyst [17]. According to this, the polytungstate must be the predominant species in the catalysts used here.
The band assigned to octahedral polytungstate spe- cies in the UV diffuse reectance spectra is for W loading higher than 0.8 wt% the most intense in the two catalyst series. In the LSiW catalysts, both the agglomeration of these species with increasing W loading and the calcination step lead to W loading of 4.0 wt% and above, to the formation of WO3 crystallites. This fact can be clearly observed in the XRD patterns of these catalysts (Fig. 3). On the other hand, in the high surface area silica this picture only occurs, although to a minor extent, for the highest W loading (Fig. 4). Therefore, the difference existing in the surface area of the two silica supports seems to be responsible for the better dispersion of tungsten oxide species in HSiW catalysts. The relative reducibility values showed in Fig. 7 demonstrate this nding.
As noted in Figs. 1 and 2, together with the bands corresponding to polymeric W(VI) species, a band appeared at 220 nm. This band, attributed to the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated species, is the only one in the HSiW 0.8 catalyst. Although the existence of this kind of species is in discrepancy with a previous work by Kim and coworkers [17], other authors have reported for low-loaded Mo/SiO2 cata- lysts the presence of tetrahedral species [21,22,25,26].
The following general picture can be concluded from the characterization results of the two catalyst series:
1. LSiW series: for the lowest W loading catalysts, a
dispersed tungsten oxide phase constituted of both tetrahedral and polytungstate species exists. For higher loading, 4.0 wt% and above, the silica surface is progressively covered by polytungstate species that agglomerate forming WO3 clusters.
Since the similar reducibility and UV DRS spectra of the LSiW catalysts with tungsten loading higher than 4.0%, it may be drawn that for 7.1 wt% loading and above the silica surface is completely covered. This nding is in good agreement with the theoretical monolayer coverage data reported in literature [15].
2. HSiW series: HSiW 0.8 catalyst possesses only
tetrahedral tungsten species. A well-dispersed tungsten oxide phase mainly consisting of poly- tungstate species is formed up to 11.9 wt% loading, Fig. 8.

149 gradually covering the silica surface. For the high- est loading WO3 aggregates begins to be formed to some extent.
4.2. Nature of the active sites for methane oxidation
Although there is a slight difference in the catalytic performance of both tungsten catalyst series (Table 2),a more detailed analysis of the results must be made on the basis of the great variation in the surface area of the supports. For this purpose, the catalytic results have been dened in terms of specic surface activity (SSA,mol CH4 converted/m2 s) and formaldehyde surface productivity (SPHCOH, mol HCOH obtained/m2 s). It can be seen in Fig. 9 that the SSA values of the LSiW catalysts are about one order of magnitude higher than those of the HSiW series. This fact can be explained taking into account the difference existing between the SSA of the two bare silica samples. The results obtained show that the density of the active sites for methane activation on the low surface silica is about one order of magnitude higher than that on HSiO2 support. On the other hand, the SPHCOH value (Fig. 10) for this latter sample is only about half of that for LSiO2 support. In the same way, this fact suggests that the density of active sites for HCOH production is higher on the high surface silica. According to Miceli et al. [27], precipitated silica possesses two kinds of active sites in reaction conditions: reduced sites and siloxane bridges (SiOSi) which are effective in activating O2 and CH4 molecules, respectively. The activated oxygen species react with methane activated molecules mainly yielding HCOH and CO2 [8,9].
Therefore, a higher number of the rst type of sites would explain the higher selectivity to HCOH and CO2 exhibited for HSiO2 sample (Table 2).
The effect of the tungsten oxide phase as a promot- ing of the catalytic activity of the silica surface is quite different in the two catalyst series. In the LSiW series,the tungsten overlayer enhances for any W loading both the SSA and SPHCOH of the silica (Figs. 9 and 10). On the other hand, in the HSiW catalysts with tungsten contents up to 7.1 wt%, the SSA of the bare silica is improved whereas higher W loading induces a negative effect (Fig. 9). Likewise, tungsten addition causes a decrease in the SPHCOH of the unpromoted high surface area silica (Fig. 10).
As observed there are catalysts with similar type of tungsten species belonging to different series that,however, present quite a different catalytic perfor- mance, i.e. LSiW 4.0 and HSiW 11.9. It may be suggested that in addition to the kind of tungsten species, other factors like the reducibility of the supported oxide phase would be responsible for the Fig. 9.

opposite catalytic activity showed by the two catalyst series. In fact, this reducibility would allow one to suppose how reduced the catalyst would be during the reaction conditions and therefore its catalytic behavior [7]. The gas-phase oxygen is activated in the reduced sites under reaction conditions and enables methane activation [7,28]. Parmaliana et al. [810] have cor- related the density of reduced sites of the MoO3/SiO2 and V2O5/SiO2 and its catalytic performance in the partial oxidation of methane. According to them, the presence of highly reducible'' tungsten oxide phase in the low surface silica (Fig. 7) produces an increase in the number of active sites up to 7.1 wt% tungsten loading. For higher loading, the silica surface is supposed to be completely covered by the tungsten oxide overlayer, which does not change in nature but only in the number of layers of tungsten atoms. UV DRS spectra (Fig. 1) and reducibility values (Fig. 7) of these catalysts support this hypothesis.On the other hand, for the HSiW catalysts the progressive covering of the silica surface by hardly reducible'' dispersed polytungstate phase (Fig. 7) leads to an approximately linear decrease in the SSA from 0.8 to 11.9 wt% tungsten loading. This trend is not observed in the highest loaded catalyst because the aggregation of tungsten species increases its reducibility (Fig. 7). The apparent improvement in the SSA of the unpromoted silica for W loading up to
7.1 wt% can be attributed to the marked decrease in
BET area that induces an increase in the number of active sites per unit area.
Nowadays, a general agreement about the speci- city of the M=O sites (M=Mo, V) of terminal atoms in metal oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species in the selective production of HCOH from methane over MoO3/SiO2 and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts seems to exist [2,3,1113]. Our results seem to agree with this idea. Thus, the presence of the LSiW catalysts with W loading higher than 4.0 wt% of W=O terminal sites in WO3 crystallites would be responsible for the high
HCOH
selectivity exhibited by these catalysts (Table 2). For the HSiW catalysts, on account of the high surface area of the support, the SPHCOH will be a function of both density and activity of three types of surface sites, namely: active sites of silica surface; WOW bridging funcionalities, that enable total oxidation of either CH4 or CO [3,12,13,26]; and W=O terminal sites. Thus, the SPHCOH progressively decreases with increasing W loading up to 11.9 wt% due to an increased polytungstate formation which induces the covering of the active sites of the silica surface and providing of the WOW sites. For the highest tungsten loading the presence of certain num- ber of WO3 crystallites with terminal W=O bonds causes a slight improvement on the HCOH selectivity.
4.3. Comparison between catalytic performance of
W/SiO2 and W/HZSM-5 catalyst In this section, a comparison between the results obtained in the present work and those previously reported for W/HZSM-5 catalysts [14] has been estab- lished.
The characterization of
W/HZSM-5
catalysts yielded the following picture [14]:
1. For tungsten loading lower than 4.0%, tetrahedral
tungsten species (grafted to Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite) were predominant though polytung- state species and WO3 crystallites were present to a minor extent (these latter for W loading higher than 2.4%). Because of their high dispersion on the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, the tungsten oxide overlayer was hardly reducible.
2. For higher tungsten, loading the external surface of
the zeolite was gradually covered by polymeric species and WO3 aggregates leading to a lesser- dispersed tungsten oxide phase. Consequently, a significant improvement of the reducibility was observed.
As seen in Fig. 9, the SSA values achieved with W/ HZSM-5 catalysts are between those of the HSiW and LSiW catalyst series. These results strongly support the fact concerning the inuence of the catalyst redu- cibility on methane activation. In fact, the relative reducibility values owing to W/HZSM-5 catalysts are higher than those of the HSiW catalysts but lower than those of the LSiW series (Fig. 7). Since acid sites of HZSM-5 were reported to be active sites for methane activation [14], their progressive covering by tungsten species would lead to a decrease in the SSA of the zeolite. However, the observed increase in tungsten oxide overlayer reducibility with increasing W load- ing, mainly for contents higher than 4.0 wt%, leads to a signicant improvement in the SSA of the HZSM-5.
The formaldehyde surface productivity values obtained for W/HZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 10) are in

151 the same order of magnitude than those of HSiW series, therefore being lower than those of LSiW ones (Fig. 10). This fact is a consequence of the high activity showed by the acid sites of HZSM-5 zeolite towards the total oxidation of methane to carbon oxides (mainly CO) [14]. Up to 2.4% W loading the presence of monomeric tungsten species with W=O sites increases sharply the SPHCOH. For higher contents, the simultaneous increase for polytungstate species and WO3 crystallites leads to a slight increase in the SPHCOH. This fact is in agreement with the different activity of WOW bridges and terminal W=O sites pointed out above for W/SiO2 catalysts.
5. Conclusions
It has been shown that both surface area of the precipitated silica and tungsten loading play a funda- mental role in the nature of the tungsten oxide over- layer and,as a consequence,in the catalytic performance of W/SiO2 catalysts. For the low surface catalyst series, the supported tungsten oxide phase consists of polytungstate species and WO3 crystallites,which for W loading higher than 7.1 wt% completely cover the silica surface. For the high surface catalyst series a well-dispersed tungsten oxide overlayer mainly consisting of polytungstate species is formed.
A close relationship between the dispersion of the tungsten species and the catalyst reducibility is observed. Thus, highly reducible tungsten oxide phase of the low surface catalysts enhances the activity of the bare silica whereas hardly reducible tungsten species of the high surface catalysts exert a negative effect on the silica activity. Formaldehyde production has been related to the density and activity of three types of active sites present in W/SiO2 catalysts: active sites of silica surface, terminal W=O sites, both leading to HCOH formation, and WOW bridging funcional- ities that enable total oxidation of either CH4 or CO.
These ndings are in good agreement with those reported by the authors for W/HZSM-5 catalysts.
