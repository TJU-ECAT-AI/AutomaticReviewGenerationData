Iron-containing heterogeneous catalysts for partial oxidation of methane and epoxidation of propylene Ye Wang *, Wei Yang, Lu juan Yang, Xiaoxing Wang, Qinghong Zhang State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China Available online 12 June 2006 Abstract Mesoporous molecular sieves containing iron sites with different dispersions and environments were studied for the partial oxidation of methane and the epoxidation of propylene. The tetrahedral Fe(III) sites incorporated inside the framework of SBA-15 showed higher HCHO selectivity under a similar CH4 conversion than the oligomeric FeOx clusters located in the mesopores in the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2. HCHO selectivity of the FeOx clusters in SBA-15 could be improved by the modification with either an acidic group (e.g., phosphate) or an alkali metal ion,which increased the dispersion or changed the local coordination environment of iron species. The catalyst containing FePO4 clusters formed by the modification with phosphate exhibited the best catalytic performances for HCHO formation. This catalyst also showed uniquely high selectivities to HCHO and CH3OH as N2O was used as the oxidant for the partial oxidation of CH4. For the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide (PO), the modification of the FeOx/SBA-15 with an alkali metal salt typified by KCl was effective. Among many SBA-15-supported transition metal oxides modified by KCl, the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 showed the best catalytic performances for the epoxidation of propylene by N2O.
The comparative studies using N2O and O2 as the oxidant revealed that N2O was necessary for PO formation over the KCl-FeOx/SBA-15 catalyst.

1. Introduction
The exploitation of iron as the active site in synthetic catalysts for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons has received extensive research attention because iron is the active center in monooxygenase enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and methane monooxygenase. There are numerous studies on homogeneous catalytic systems using iron compounds or iron complexes for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [1,2].
However, iron-based heterogeneous oxidation catalytic systems reported so far are limited. Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst combined with N2O oxidant was effective for the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol [3]. Although it was shown that the adsorbed oxygen (a-oxygen) pre-generated by the decomposition of N2O over the Fe-ZSM-5 may react with CH4 even at room temperature to form surface methoxy species, the steady-state catalytic oxidation of CH4 with N2O at a temperature needed for N2O decomposition only produced CO and CO2 as the main products with a minor amount of CH3OH [3,4]. Wang and Otsuka [58] showed in a series of studies that FePO4 was an efficient catalyst for the partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO by O2 and to oxygenates including CH3OH and HCHO by O2H2 gas mixture or N2O. Kobayashi et al. [911] clarified that a small amount of Fe3+ doped in silica could catalyze the partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO by O2, and it was proposed that the small amount of mononuclear FeIII probably incorporated into the silica matrix was responsible for HCHO formation. Arena and Parmaliana [1214] adopted an adsorptionprecipita- tion method for the synthesis of the FeOx/SiO2 samples containing relatively higher concentration of iron species with high dispersion and investigated their catalytic activities for partial oxidation of CH4 by O2.
A few studies have contributed to the epoxidation of alkenes using Fe-containing heterogeneous catalysts. Fe-MCM-41 with FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 could catalyze the epoxidation of styrene with diluted H2O2 [15]. Single-site FeIII centers grafted on the inner surfaces of SBA-15 showed a high efficiency for the epoxidation of various alkenes with www.elsevier.com/locate/cattod Catalysis Today 117 (2006) 156162 * Corresponding author.

Most of the existing researches seem to suggest that a high dispersion of iron species is necessary for the selective oxidation reactions since iron oxides such as a-Fe2O3 tend to catalyze the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO and CO2.
More detailed elucidations of structurereactivity relationships are important for the development of efficient iron-based heterogeneous selective oxidation catalysts.
Mesoporous materials possess ordered porous structures, and the active components tailored in their nano-ordered spaces may have improved catalytic performances. We have clarified that MCM- 41 and SBA-15 are superior catalyst supports for FePO4, VOx and MoOx for the partial oxidation of CH4 [1821]. Moreover,iron may have different locations and different local structures in a mesoporous silica, e.g., FeOx clusters in mesopores or isolated FeIII in framework positions. In a previous paper, we showed that the FeIII in the framework of MCM-41 was more efficient than the FeOx clusters for the conversion of CH4 to HCHO by O2 [22]. The environment of the iron sites can further be modified by the presence of acidic groups or alkali metal ions. We have been working on the elucidation of the relationships between the structures and environments of the active iron sites introduced into mesoporous silica and their catalytic behaviors in selective oxidation reactions. In the present paper, we present some of our recent research results on the partial oxidation of CH4 to useful oxygenates and the epoxidation of propylene, which are two highly desirable but very difficult reactions.
2. Experimental
Iron-containing SBA-15 materials were prepared by the following methods. In the direct synthesis, an iron source (FeCl3) was added into the synthesis gel containing the silica source (SiCl4) and the template (Pluronic P123 triblock copolymer). After hydrothermal synthesis, the resultant solid was filtered, washed, dried and finally calcined at 550 or 650 8C for 6 h. The obtained samples were denoted as Fe-SBA-15. The conventional impregnation method was also applied to the preparation of iron-containing SBA-15 samples (denoted as FeOx/SBA-15) using an ethanolic solution of [Fe(acac)3] (acac,acetylacetonate). The FeOx/SBA-15 was modified by various acid and alkaline additives including P, S, B, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs by impregnation of the FeOx/SBA-15 with an aqueous solution of phosphate, sulphate, borate or an alkali metal salt.
The catalysts were characterized by XRD, diffuse reflec- tance UVvis, and Raman spectroscopic measurements. XRD was performed with a Panalytical XPert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Diffuse reflectance UV vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary-5000 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse-reflectance accessory. Raman spectro- scopic measurements were carried out with a Renishaw UVvis Raman System 1000R. The UV-line at 325 nm from a Kimmon IK3201R-F HeCd laser was used as the exciting source to avoid the influence of fluorescence.
The partial oxidation of CH4 and the epoxidation of C3H6 were carried out using a fixed-bed flow reactor (quartz tube) operated at atmospheric pressure. The products were analysed by on-line gas chromatography. All the lines and valves between the exit of the reactor and the gas chromatographs were heated to 120 8C to prevent the condensation of products.
Porapak T column was used for the separation of CH3OH and HCHO in the case of CH4 partial oxidation, and for the separation of PO, acrolein, allyl alcohol, acetone, propional- dehyde and acetaldehyde in the case of C3H6 oxidation. The separations of other products and the remaining reactants in both cases were achieved by Porapak Q and Molecular Sieve 5A columns.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparative studies of iron-containing mesoporous
materials synthesized by different method for partial oxidation of CH4 by O2 In a previous paper [22], we carried out comparative studies with Fe-MCM-41 synthesized by two different methods, i.e.,the direct hydrothermal (DHT) and the template-ion exchange (TIE) methods, and arrived at a conclusion that the iron sites isolated in the framework in the Fe-MCM-41-DHT were more active and selective than the oligomeric FeOx in the Fe-MCM- 41-TIE for the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2. However, the HCHO selectivity obtained over the Fe-MCM-41-DHT catalyst was still very low (ca. 15% at a 2% CH4 conversion).
We recently found that, as compared with MCM-41, SBA-15 was a better support for the loadings of MoOx [19], VOx [20,21] and FePO4 [23] for the partial oxidation of CH4 by O2 due to its larger pore diameter and more inert property without any acid sites. Thus, here we first compare the catalytic performances of the Fe-SBA-15 prepared by the direct synthesis and the FeOx/ SBA-15 prepared by the impregnation. It should be noted that only ca. 0.1 wt% Fe could be incorporated into SBA-15 by the
