1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds and the formation of M-alkyl intermediates. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism involving C-H activation by β-bond metathesis, accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, followed by H transfer to chromium and the subsequent loss of ethene. The regeneration of the chromium site under the evolution of H2 is also considered. The literature highlights the importance of the local structure of the chromium surface sites and the electronic energy profiles for the reactions. The study uses quantum chemical methods to optimize stationary points and calculate free energies, identifying the rate-determining steps. The influence of the local structure on the energy requirements of the various elementary steps during dehydrogenation is also investigated. The literature does not directly address the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, but it does suggest that the dispersion of active chromium species and the nature of the surface play a role in the catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了单核Cr(III)硅胶模型上乙烷的脱氢，探讨了C-H键的活化和M-烷基中间体的形成。研究集中于一个反应机制，涉及通过β-键变位C-H活化，伴随OH和CrC键的形成，随后是H向铬的转移和随后的乙烯损失。还考虑了在H2演化下铬位点的再生。文献强调了铬表面位点的局部结构和反应的电子能谱的重要性。研究使用量子化学方法优化驻点并计算自由能，确定速率决定步骤。还研究了局部结构对脱氢过程中各种基本步骤的能量要求的影响。文献没有直接解决位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用，但它确实表明活性铬物种的分散和表面的性质在催化活性中起作用。
