1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models using quantum chemical methods. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex. The study identifies the rate-determining steps and investigates the influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism. The literature does not directly address the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, or the interplay between various catalysts. However, it does suggest that the mechanism of CH activation is crucial for the dehydrogenation mechanism and that the activity of the catalyst is sensitive to the local structure about chromium.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了使用量子化学方法研究单核Cr(III)硅酸盐模型对乙烷的脱氢作用。研究重点是一种由三个主要步骤组成的反应机制：(1)根据-bond metathesis进行乙烷的CH活化，同时形成OH和CrC键，(2) -H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯，(3)在H2的演化下再生铬位点。还探讨了一种替代机制，其中CH活化发生在活性氢化铬复合物上。研究确定了速率决定步骤，并研究了铬表面位点的局部结构对反应机制的影响。文献没有直接解决实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用或各种催化剂之间的相互作用。然而，它确实表明CH活化机制对于脱氢机制至关重要，催化剂的活性对铬周围的局部结构敏感。
