1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models, exploring the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and the abstraction of 2H. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) C-H activation of ethane according to σ-bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. The influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism is also explored. The literature suggests that the mechanism of dehydrogenation is sensitive to the local structure about chromium, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了单核Cr(III)硅胶模型上乙烷的脱氢，探讨了C-H键的活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H的抽象。研究重点是一种由三个主要步骤组成的反应机制：(1)根据σ键互换对乙烷进行C-H活化，同时形成OH和CrC键，(2) H转移到铬，随后失去乙烯，(3)在H2的演化下再生铬位点。还探讨了铬表面位点的局部结构对反应机制的影响。文献表明，脱氢的机制对铬周围的局部结构敏感，位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
