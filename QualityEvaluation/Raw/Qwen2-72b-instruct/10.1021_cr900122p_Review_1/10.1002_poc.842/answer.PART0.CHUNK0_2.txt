1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation of ethane over mononuclear Cr(III)silica models using quantum chemical methods. The study focuses on a reaction mechanism consisting of three main steps: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis and accompanied by the formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site under evolution of H2. An alternative mechanism is also explored, in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex. The study identifies the rate-determining steps and explores the influence of the local structure of the chromium surface sites on the reaction mechanism. The literature does not directly address the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, but it does suggest that the local structure about chromium plays a sensitive role in determining the effective mechanism for dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机制或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体信息。但是,它确实使用量子化学方法讨论了单核Cr(III)硅胶模型上乙烷的脱氢。研究重点是一种由三个主要步骤组成的反应机制:(1)根据-bond metathesis进行乙烷的CH活化,并伴随OH和CrC键的形成,(2)氢转移到铬,随后失去乙烯,(3)在H2的演化下再生铬位点。还探讨了一种替代机制,其中CH活化发生在反应性的氢化铬复合物上。研究确定了速率决定步骤,并探讨了铬表面位点的局部结构对反应机制的影响。文献没有直接讨论位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用,但它确实表明,铬周围的局部结构在决定有效的脱氢机制中起着敏感的作用。
