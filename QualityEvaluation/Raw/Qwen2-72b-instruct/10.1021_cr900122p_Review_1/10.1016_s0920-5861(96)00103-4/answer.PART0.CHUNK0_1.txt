[1] "The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step."
[2] "Majority of the catalysts correspond to metal- lic oxides with V or Mo as one of the key elements but also cations of variable oxidation states as Fe3+/Fe2+; VS+/V 3+, Mo6+/Mo 5+, Cr6+/Cr 3+, Cu2+/fu+, Sb3+/SbS+, etc."
[3] "The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction."
[4] "An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer."
[5] "The oxygen atom incorporated into the sub- strate stems from the lattice and is at - 2 oxida- tion state. Its replacement by molecular oxygen necessitates electrons according to: 0 2 + 4e----> 20 2- . This process has its own kinetics related to the reactivity of the sites with oxygen, their concentration, the efficiency of electron trans- fer, the partial pressure of oxygen, etc."
[6] "The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal."
[7] "Without any hypothesis about the nature of the metal-oxygen bond one can write with formation of a w-alkyl complex (as usually admitted) or a 8-alkyl complex."
[8] "Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties."
[9] "One may distinguish three extreme cases:+ - (nucleophilic)  0 2- (a) M -- 0 (b)M--O  O- (c) M _ _ _

[10] "Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring."
[11] "Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins."
[12] "Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking)."
[13] "Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present."
[14] "For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4]."
[15] "The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite."
[16] "A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5]."
[17] "It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein

[18] "The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to edge sharing dimers of VO 6 octahedra bonded to the following chain by PO 4 tetrahedra was shown to be the active and selective face [9]."
[19] "One has one oxygen of V = O bond pointing away from the surface and the second one point- ing downward in the form of a dimer as schematized in Fig. 3."
[20] "In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface and have proposed that the active site is com- posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated one from the other by excess of phosphate species as schematised in Fig. 3."
[21] "The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to edge sharing dimers of VO 6 octahedra bonded to the following chain by PO 4 tetrahedra was shown to be the active and selective face [9]."
[22] "The main idea one may keep in mind from this study is that inorganic clusters of iron octa- hedra with iron at two oxidation states are ac- tive for the reaction studied and that one has to consider the active sites as these clusters, pref- erentially as ensemble of two trimers although other sizes (dimers, tetramers, pentamers...) are also active and selective but to a lesser extent."
[23] "The iron oxidation state is changing during the reaction in a similar way that the va/v 5 redox couple on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Section 4)."
[24] "This again shows that metallic oxides have to be considered with a dynamical view during the oxidation reaction."
[25] "Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds."
[26] "For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2
Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons."
[27] "It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21]."
[28] "The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters."
[29] "One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition."
[30] "One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties."
[31] "In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%."
[32] "The hydroxyl groups of the silica were observed by infrared and/or UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies to decrease in intensity with Mo loading and to disappear at 7 wt% Mo loading while two UV bands were appearing at 245 and 340 nm."
[33] "The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species."
[34] "The former band was observed to increase in intensity propor- tionally to Mo loading at low Mo loading and to saturate at roughly 3 wt% Mo."
[35] "The latter band was observed to appear near 2 wt% Mo, to increase proportionally to Mo content up to 7 wt% Mo and then to decrease slowly with Mo loading."
[36] "Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation."
[37] "The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst."
[38] "One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air."
[39] "The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings."
[40] "This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7)."
[41] "The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8)."
[42] "Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading."

[45] "Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack."
[46] "These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic."
[47] "Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic."
[48] "One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis."
[49] "This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction."
[50] "Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia."
[51] "The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form."
[52] "Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories."
[53] "All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1."
[54] "Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-"
[55] "The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e.
0.43 nm2):"
[56] "(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation."

V205."
[58] "(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation."

[60] "The idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the dif- ferent oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size)."
[61] "It has been described above how the size of the deposited oxide species (mono- meric, polymeric, bulk-type) results in different catalytic properties."
[62] "Vanadium oxide has been deposited on sev- eral supports as silica, alumina, titania but also zirconia, niobia, zirconium hydroxyphosphate,etc."
[63] "Its reductibility was studied by reduction by hydrogen at 400C."
[64] "It was observed that V on TiO 2 and /-A1203 was reduced rather fast and one reached a consumption such as an O/V atomic ratio near to 1 for TiO 2 and 0.65 for A1203 [25]."
[65] "At variance for silica the reduction was much slower and an O/V ratio of 0.57 was obtained."
[66] "Such differences were interpreted by the authors as due to different species on the surface: mainly monomeric VO43- species for TiO z, dimeric species Vz O4- for /-A1203 (23) and V205 crystallites for silica [26]."
[67] "The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5."
[68] "Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range."
[69] "Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27]."
[70] "In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28]."
[71] "By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the activation of C-H bonds, often facilitated by metal oxides as catalysts. These catalysts, such as those containing V or Mo, play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism by providing active sites for the oxidation of the substrate. The reaction typically proceeds via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving the presence of an active cationic site that oxidizes the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the material to facilitate electron and oxygen species transfer, which is essential for the reoxidation of the reduced catalyst.
2. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions is a significant challenge due to the competing pathways that can lead to total oxidation or other unwanted byproducts. The selectivity of the process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, particularly the size and structure of the active sites. For instance, monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- tend to exhibit acidic features, leading to total oxidation properties, whereas low-size polymeric species show better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions. Site isolation, where active sites are separated by non-reactive species, can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.
3. The reaction mechanisms in ODH involve the activation of C-H bonds, often through the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, which can then undergo further reactions to produce the desired products. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as the redox properties of the catalyst, the stability of the active sites under reaction conditions, and the ability of the catalyst to regenerate after the reaction. Site isolation can enhance selectivity by limiting the interaction between active sites, preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.
4. The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane substrate. The selectivity and conversion of the process can be improved by optimizing the catalyst structure, such as by controlling the size and distribution of active sites, and by adjusting the reaction conditions to favor the desired pathway. Site isolation can enhance selectivity by limiting the interaction between active sites, preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及C-H键的活化，通常由金属氧化物作为催化剂促进。这些催化剂，如含V或Mo的催化剂，在反应机制中起着关键作用，通过提供氧化底物的活性位点。反应通常通过Mars和van Krevelen机制进行，涉及存在一个活性阳离子位点，该位点氧化底物，以及另一个对氧气还原活性的位点。过程的效率受材料促进电子和氧物种转移的能力的影响，这对还原催化剂的再氧化至关重要。
2. 在ODH反应中实现高选择性和转化率是一个重大挑战，因为竞争途径可能导致完全氧化或其他不希望的副产品。过程的选择性受催化剂性质的影响，特别是活性位点的大小和结构。例如，像MoO42-或VO43-这样的单体物种往往表现出酸性特征，导致完全氧化性质，而低尺寸的聚合物种显示出更好的部分氧化反应选择性。位点隔离，其中活性位点由非反应性物种分离，可以通过防止副产品的形成和促进所需的反应途径来帮助解决选择性问题。
3. ODH中的反应机制涉及C-H键的活化，通常通过形成M-烷基中间体，然后可以进一步反应产生所需的产品。过程的效率受催化剂的氧化还原性质、反应条件下活性位点的稳定性以及催化剂在反应后再生的能力等因素的影响。位点隔离可以通过限制活性位点之间的相互作用，防止副产品的形成，促进所需的反应途径，从而提高选择性。
4. ODH过程的效率受催化剂、反应条件和烷烃底物性质之间的相互作用的影响。通过优化催化剂结构，如控制活性位点的大小和分布，以及调整反应条件以有利于所需的途径，可以提高过程的选择性和转化率。位点隔离可以通过限制活性位点之间的相互作用，防止副产品的形成，促进所需的反应途径，从而提高选择性。
