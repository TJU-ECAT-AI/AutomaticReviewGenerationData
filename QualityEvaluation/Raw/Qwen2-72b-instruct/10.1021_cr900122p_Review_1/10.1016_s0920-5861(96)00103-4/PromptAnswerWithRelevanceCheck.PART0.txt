The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic.

The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].

Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- portant catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid (MAA).
It was shown that the active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2,composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octa- hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one from the other by PO 4 tetrahedra.

A study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibit- ing clusters of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes has been carried out.
It turns out that all catalysts were belonging after catalytic testing to the same solid solution of the type F3+ 1-- 2+(PO4)3(OH)3_3xO3 x with 0 < x < 1 e4_xt'e3x _ _ (Fig. 5).
Depending upon their composition these phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous chains (Fe2(PO4)O).
The results showed that all samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clus- ters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a.
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds.
For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons.
It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties.
In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein

These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The reaction mechanisms typically involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the selectivity and conversion rates, which are determined by the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The size of the active site is a critical factor in oxidation catalysis, as it affects the catalytic properties and the selectivity of the catalyst. Structure-sensitive reactions, such as ODH, are particularly influenced by the size and arrangement of the active sites on the catalyst surface.

The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
Majority of the catalysts correspond to metal- lic oxides with V or Mo as one of the key elements but also cations of variable oxidation states as Fe3+/Fe2+; VS+/V 3+, Mo6+/Mo 5+, Cr6+/Cr 3+, Cu2+/fu+, Sb3+/SbS+, etc.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
The oxygen atom incorporated into the sub- strate stems from the lattice and is at - 2 oxida- tion state. Its replacement by molecular oxygen necessitates electrons according to: 0 2 + 4e----> 20 2- . This process has its own kinetics related to the reactivity of the sites with oxygen, their concentration, the efficiency of electron trans- fer, the partial pressure of oxygen, etc.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Without any hypothesis about the nature of the metal-oxygen bond one can write with formation of a w-alkyl complex (as usually admitted) or a 8-alkyl complex.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.

Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].

The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to edge sharing dimers of VO 6 octahedra bonded to the following chain by PO 4 tetrahedra was shown to be the active and selective face [9].
One has one oxygen of V = O bond pointing away from the surface and the second one point- ing downward in the form of a dimer as schematized in Fig. 3.
In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface and have proposed that the active site is com- posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated one from the other by excess of phosphate species as schematised in Fig. 3.
The main idea one may keep in mind from this study is that inorganic clusters of iron octa- hedra with iron at two oxidation states are ac- tive for the reaction studied and that one has to consider the active sites as these clusters, pref- erentially as ensemble of two trimers although other sizes (dimers, tetramers, pentamers...) are also active and selective but to a lesser extent.
The iron oxidation state is changing during the reaction in a similar way that the va/v 5 redox couple on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Section 4).
This again shows that metallic oxides have to be considered with a dynamical view during the oxidation reaction.
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds.
For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2
Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons.
It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.

One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties.
In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%.
The hydroxyl groups of the silica were observed by infrared and/or UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies to decrease in intensity with Mo loading and to disappear at 7 wt% Mo loading while two UV bands were appearing at 245 and 340 nm.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The former band was observed to increase in intensity propor- tionally to Mo loading at low Mo loading and to saturate at roughly 3 wt% Mo.
The latter band was observed to appear near 2 wt% Mo, to increase proportionally to Mo content up to 7 wt% Mo and then to decrease slowly with Mo loading.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.

Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.

This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e.
43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt%
V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
The idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the dif- ferent oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size).
It has been described above how the size of the deposited oxide species (mono- meric, polymeric, bulk-type) results in different catalytic properties.
Vanadium oxide has been deposited on sev- eral supports as silica, alumina, titania but also zirconia, niobia, zirconium hydroxyphosphate,etc.
Its reductibility was studied by reduction by hydrogen at 400C.
It was observed that V on TiO 2 and /-A1203 was reduced rather fast and one reached a consumption such as an O/V atomic ratio near to 1 for TiO 2 and 0.65 for A1203 [25].
At variance for silica the reduction was much slower and an O/V ratio of 0.57 was obtained.
Such differences were interpreted by the authors as due to different species on the surface: mainly monomeric VO43- species for TiO z, dimeric species Vz O4- for /-A1203 (23) and V205 crystallites for silica [26].
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the activation of C-H bonds, often facilitated by metal oxides as catalysts. These catalysts, such as those containing V or Mo, play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism by providing active sites for the oxidation of the substrate. The reaction typically proceeds via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving the presence of an active cationic site that oxidizes the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the material to facilitate electron and oxygen species transfer, which is essential for the reoxidation of the reduced catalyst.
2. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions is a significant challenge due to the competing pathways that can lead to total oxidation or other unwanted byproducts. The selectivity of the process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, particularly the size and structure of the active sites. For instance, monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- tend to exhibit acidic features, leading to total oxidation properties, whereas low-size polymeric species show better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions. Site isolation, where active sites are separated by non-reactive species, can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.
3. The reaction mechanisms in ODH involve the activation of C-H bonds, often through the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, which can then undergo further reactions to produce the desired products. The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as the redox properties of the catalyst, the stability of the active sites under reaction conditions, and the ability of the catalyst to regenerate after the reaction. Site isolation can enhance selectivity by limiting the interaction between active sites, preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.
4. The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane substrate. The selectivity and conversion of the process can be improved by optimizing the catalyst structure, such as by controlling the size and distribution of active sites, and by adjusting the reaction conditions to favor the desired pathway. Site isolation can enhance selectivity by limiting the interaction between active sites, preventing the formation of byproducts and promoting the desired reaction pathway.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及C-H键的活化，通常由金属氧化物作为催化剂促进。这些催化剂，如含V或Mo的催化剂，在反应机制中起着关键作用，通过提供氧化底物的活性位点。反应通常通过Mars和van Krevelen机制进行，涉及存在一个活性阳离子位点，该位点氧化底物，以及另一个对氧气还原活性的位点。过程的效率受材料促进电子和氧物种转移的能力的影响，这对还原催化剂的再氧化至关重要。
2. 在ODH反应中实现高选择性和转化率是一个重大挑战，因为竞争途径可能导致完全氧化或其他不希望的副产品。过程的选择性受催化剂性质的影响，特别是活性位点的大小和结构。例如，像MoO42-或VO43-这样的单体物种往往表现出酸性特征，导致完全氧化性质，而低尺寸的聚合物种显示出更好的部分氧化反应选择性。位点隔离，其中活性位点由非反应性物种分离，可以通过防止副产品的形成和促进所需的反应途径来帮助解决选择性问题。
3. ODH中的反应机制涉及C-H键的活化，通常通过形成M-烷基中间体，然后可以进一步反应产生所需的产品。过程的效率受催化剂的氧化还原性质、反应条件下活性位点的稳定性以及催化剂在反应后再生的能力等因素的影响。位点隔离可以通过限制活性位点之间的相互作用，防止副产品的形成，促进所需的反应途径，从而提高选择性。
4. ODH过程的效率受催化剂、反应条件和烷烃底物性质之间的相互作用的影响。通过优化催化剂结构，如控制活性位点的大小和分布，以及调整反应条件以有利于所需的途径，可以提高过程的选择性和转化率。位点隔离可以通过限制活性位点之间的相互作用，防止副产品的形成，促进所需的反应途径，从而提高选择性。

Here too, the preparation and the activation of the samples appeared also to be particularly crucial in order to obtain a well performing catalyst.
In all cases, whatever the catalysts being good or exceptionally good,the (VO)2P207 phase (V 4 cations) as a main con- stituent was detected by X-ray diffraction and by in situ laser Raman spectroscopy [8] in addi- tion to small amounts of some VOPO 4 phases (V 5+ cations) as all, [3, / or .
Moreover, VOPO 4 pure phases were observed to be active and selective although to a lesser extent.
It turned out that the presence of some V 5+ cations on the V 4 catalyst surface of (VO)2P207 was necessary although an excess was observed to be detrimental.
Moreover the catalyst surface was observed to be richer in P than the bulk by a ratio of about 2.
The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to edge sharing dimers of VO 6 octahedra bonded to the following chain by PO 4 tetrahedra was shown to be the active and selective face [9].
One has one oxygen of V = O bond pointing away from the surface and the second one point- ing downward in the form of a dimer as schematized in Fig. 3.
In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface and have proposed that the active site is com- posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated one from the other by excess of phosphate species as schematised in Fig. 3.
Note that if such an assumption is true it is hard to under- stand how such activated oxygen species may be stable at high temperature and to understand the moving bed technology recently developed by the Du Pont researchers [ 11].
At variance the concept of four dimers as an active site seems reasonable and coherent with the scheme pro- posed by Ziolkowski [12] and Bordes [13].
Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- portant catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid (MAA).
This reaction is important as a first step to form methyl methacrylate monomer used for plexiglass or altuglass formation by polymerisa- tion.
The industrial type catalyst contains iron hydroxyphosphate of uncertain nature and Cs or NH 4 as additive and unfortunately necessitates a large amount of water in the feed (namely 10 to 12 mol H20 per mol of IBA) to remain stable with time on steam.
This makes this process difficult to be developed industrially.
Taking into account the phase diagram Fe203- FeO-P205 it could be possible to select and study several phases which contain Fe 2+, Fe 3+ or both cations able to insure the redox mecha- nism necessary for the reaction to take place as it was shown to proceed via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism [18].
It was shown that the active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2,composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octa- hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one from the other by PO 4 tetrahedra.
The active sites were shown to correspond to a group of two trimers facing each other on their respective P/P+Fe

The way the octahedra are connected to each other may be an important parameter since it has been shown that the other polymorphic form of Fe3(P207) 2 namely [Fe3(P2OT) 2 was poorly active and selective.
In this phase, the central iron atom is in fact occupying a FeO 6 trigonal prism (Fig. 4b).

A study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibit- ing clusters of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes has been carried out.
It turns out that all catalysts were belonging after catalytic testing to the same solid solution of the type F3+ 1-- 2+(PO4)3(OH)3_3xO3 x with 0 < x < 1 e4_xt'e3x _ _ (Fig. 5).
Depending upon their composition these phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous chains (Fe2(PO4)O).
The results showed that all samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clus- ters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a.
The added water plays a role as for the active phase of the industrial catalyst in stabiliz- ing the hydroxylated catalysts and the redox couple is the same but implies O/OH instead of POa/PO3OH couple.
In a theoretical study using extended Hstickel molecular orbital calculation it has been shown that for iron octahedra assembled as dimers [19], trimers [20] or larger clusters there may occur electron exchange between Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + cations.
This occurs in the case of trimers but X=2 X=3 X>3 Fig. 6. Electron exchange between iron cations in (FeOt) n octahe- dra clusters calculated by extended Huckel molecular orbital theory (from [19] and [20]). neither for dimers nor for trimers in Fe3(PeOT)e (Fig. 6).
This electron exchange between iron cations very probably favors the redox mechanism and thus the catalytic proper- ties but should be limited to the closest neigh- bouts to give the best performing catalysts.
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds.
For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 2Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons.
It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
The main idea one may keep in mind from this study is that inorganic clusters of iron octa- hedra with iron at two oxidation states are ac- tive for the reaction studied and that one has to consider the active sites as these clusters, pref- erentially as ensemble of two trimers although other sizes (dimers, tetramers, pentamers...) are also active and selective but to a lesser extent.
The iron oxidation state is changing during the reaction in a similar way that the va/v 5 redox couple on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Section 4).
This again shows that metallic oxides have to be considered with a dynamical view during the oxidation reaction.
Supports are very often used in catalysis for several reasons, namely:(i) Dispersion of the active phase in order to increase the surface to volume ratio since het- erogeneous catalysis is occurring at the solid surface.
(ii) Heat transfer: this is a particularly impor- J. C Vedrine et al. / Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13 9 tant aspect in oxidation reactions because of the high exothermicity involved.
This holds particu- larly true at industrial scale since the hot spot problem is very crucial and should be monitored with precision within a few degrees to avoid local overactivity and subsequently overheating and presumably irreversible phase transforma- tion of the catalyst.
(iii) Attrition: this aspect is of main impor- tance for fluidized or solid transported beds.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
(iv) Formation of new catalytic sites: this point will be emphasised below in some exam- ples.
One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties.
(v) Modification of the active phase proper- ties due to its chemical interaction with the support, including epitaxial induced modifica- tions.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties.
For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
6.1. Molybdenum oxide supported on silica Different procedures may be used such as impregnation of silica with a molybdate salt or grafting molybdenum chloride or molybdenum based organometallic compounds such as Mo
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution.
As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%.
The hydroxyl groups of the silica were observed by infrared and/or UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies to decrease in intensity with Mo loading and to disappear at 7 wt% Mo loading while two UV bands were appearing at 245 and 340 nm.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The former band was observed to increase in intensity propor- tionally to Mo loading at low Mo loading and to saturate at roughly 3 wt% Mo.
The latter band was observed to appear near 2 wt% Mo, to increase proportionally to Mo content up to 7 wt% Mo and then to decrease slowly with Mo loading.

+ H20 The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8.

Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
6.2. Vanadium oxide on TiO 2 support Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
J.C. Vedrine et al./ Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13 11 lites [24], the relative amount of which de- pended on initial at % V2Os/anatase and on the subsequent selective dissolution treatment.
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
6.3. Various oxides deposited on different oxide supports The idea is here to determine how a support may modify the catalytic properties of the dif- ferent oxide species (as inorganic clusters of different size).
It has been described above how the size of the deposited oxide species (mono- meric, polymeric, bulk-type) results in different catalytic properties.
Vanadium oxide has been deposited on sev- eral supports as silica, alumina, titania but also zirconia, niobia, zirconium hydroxyphosphate,etc.
Its reductibility was studied by reduction by hydrogen at 400C.
It was observed that V on TiO 2 and /-A1203 was reduced rather fast and one reached a consumption such as an O/V atomic ratio near to 1 for TiO 2 and 0.65 for A1203 [25].
At variance for silica the reduction was much slower and an O/V ratio of 0.57 was obtained.
Such differences were interpreted by the authors as due to different species on the surface: mainly monomeric VO43- species for TiO z, dimeric species Vz O4- for /-A1203 (23) and V205 crystallites for silica [26].
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
7. Conclusions Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12 J.C. Vedrine et al. / Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13 oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the local environment around the active sites, which can affect the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts.

The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step.
Majority of the catalysts correspond to metal- lic oxides with V or Mo as one of the key elements but also cations of variable oxidation states as Fe3+/Fe2+; VS+/V 3+, Mo6+/Mo 5+, Cr6+/Cr 3+, Cu2+/fu+, Sb3+/SbS+, etc.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
The oxygen atom incorporated into the sub- strate stems from the lattice and is at - 2 oxida- tion state. Its replacement by molecular oxygen necessitates electrons according to: 0 2 + 4e----> 20 2- . This process has its own kinetics related to the reactivity of the sites with oxygen, their concentration, the efficiency of electron trans- fer, the partial pressure of oxygen, etc.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein

Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds. For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The formation of the former species was described by the reaction in Scheme 2.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.

Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

oxygen ions.
Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts.
A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.
Parameters such as reducibility and reoxidability features of the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- tions.
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- ences the catalytic properties.
In some examples the number of atoms constituting the active sites could be established.
For instance double trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra are particularly active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four dimers of VO 6 octahedra are suggested to be the active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts.
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.
The characteri- zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is rather difficult and the above statements for supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative.
To better characterize such clusters, techniques as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number and nearby element distances) and radial elec- tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- tances) have to be used.
Already data have been obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 2, A1203 or TiO 2 support.
This holds true only if one has one type of cluster species to analyse.
The reader interested may read a chapter de- voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine (1988 and 1994) ([29,30]).
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions.
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice.
This latter phenomenon results from the wetting effect particularly for multicomponent and supported oxide catalysts.
It follows that for many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- essary before the catalyst reaches its steady state.
It is frequent that in an industrial plant a steady state is reached only after one or two hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several years before having to be replaced.
For simple catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to change the material morphology (the (100) face of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the adequate addition of additive elements which regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio.
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical under catalytic reaction conditions is essential for our understanding of its functioning.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the activation of C-H bonds, often facilitated by metal oxides with variable oxidation states such as V or Mo, and cations like Fe3+/Fe2+, VS+/V 3+, Mo6+/Mo 5+, Cr6+/Cr 3+, Cu2+/Cu+, Sb3+/SbS+. The process typically proceeds via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving two distinct active sites: one cationic site that oxidizes the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction. The efficiency of electron and oxygen species transfer is crucial for the reaction. The oxygen atom incorporated into the substrate originates from the lattice and is at a -2 oxidation state, necessitating electrons for its replacement by molecular oxygen. The mechanism of C-H bond activation can occur through a concerted action with homolytic breaking of a metal-oxygen bond, transferring one electron to the metal. The metal-oxygen bond's polarization determines the oxygen ion's electrophilic or nucleophilic properties, influencing the reaction pathway. Nucleophilic oxygen ions intervene in C-H bond activation in alkenes or aromatics, while electrophilic oxygen ions allow direct attack on a double bond. The concept of structure sensitivity, introduced by Boudart for metals and later for oxides, highlights the importance of the solid surface's stereochemistry and the reactant molecule's fitting for optimal catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, MoO3 crystals with different relative amounts of basal, side, and apical faces exhibit varying activity and selectivity in propene oxidation to acrolein and COx. The (100) side plane is selective for acrolein formation, while the (010) basal plane favors total oxidation. The activation of propene into an alkyl intermediate occurs on the (100) side plane, and the O atom insertion occurs on the (010) basal plane. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by limiting the interaction between active sites, potentially enhancing the selectivity for partial oxidation reactions.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及C-H键的活化，通常由具有可变氧化态的金属氧化物如V或Mo，以及Fe3+/Fe2+，VS+/V 3+，Mo6+/Mo 5+，Cr6+/Cr 3+，Cu2+/Cu+，Sb3+/SbS+等阳离子促进。该过程通常通过Mars和van Krevelen机制进行，涉及两种不同的活性位点：一个阳离子位点氧化底物，另一个位点对氧气还原活性。电子和氧物种转移的效率对于反应至关重要。被纳入底物的氧原子来源于晶格，处于-2氧化态，需要电子来替换分子氧。C-H键活化的机制可以通过与金属-氧键的均裂的协同作用，将一个电子转移到金属上。金属-氧键的极化决定了氧离子的亲电性或亲核性，影响反应途径。亲核氧离子在烯烃或芳香化合物中C-H键的活化中发挥作用，而亲电氧离子允许直接攻击双键。结构敏感性的概念，最初由Boudart为金属引入，后来为氧化物引入，强调了固体表面的立体化学和反应分子的匹配对于获得最佳催化活性和选择性的重要性。例如，具有不同相对量的基面，侧面和顶面的MoO3晶体在丙烯氧化为丙烯醛和COx中表现出不同的活性和选择性。侧面（100）平面选择性地形成丙烯醛，而基面（010）平面促进完全氧化。丙烯活化为烷基中间体发生在侧面（100）平面上，而O原子插入发生在基面（010）平面上。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥作用，通过限制活性位点之间的相互作用，可能增强对部分氧化反应的选择性。

The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction.
The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction.
An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer.
It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned.
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- tron to the metal.
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties.
One may distinguish three extreme cases:+ - (nucleophilic)  0 2- (a) M -- 0 (b)M--O  O- (c) M _ _ _ O- + (electrophilic) ---> _ _ O - - I
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring.
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins.
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking).
Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present.
For instance in the work by Volta et al.,it was shown that single crystal type samples of MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and (101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to acrolein and CO x [4].
The originality of the work was to synthesize crystals of various shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite.
A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5].
It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein 0.06 2.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 But- 1 -ene Butadiene 3 9.3 CO, CO 2 1 0 Isobutene Methacrolein 0 0.6 Acetone 0.06 0 CO, CO 2 0 1 0.7 0 2 0 0.1 0.06 0 6
Here too, the preparation and the activation of the samples appeared also to be particularly crucial in order to obtain a well performing catalyst.
In all cases, whatever the catalysts being good or exceptionally good,the (VO)2P207 phase (V 4 cations) as a main con- stituent was detected by X-ray diffraction and by in situ laser Raman spectroscopy [8] in addi- tion to small amounts of some VOPO 4 phases (V 5+ cations) as all, [3, / or .
Moreover, VOPO 4 pure phases were observed to be active and selective although to a lesser extent.
It turned out that the presence of some V 5+ cations on the V 4 catalyst surface of (VO)2P207 was necessary although an excess was observed to be detrimental.
Moreover the catalyst surface was observed to be richer in P than the bulk by a ratio of about 2.
The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding to edge sharing dimers of VO 6 octahedra bonded to the following chain by PO 4 tetrahedra was shown to be the active and selective face [9].
One has one oxygen of V = O bond pointing away from the surface and the second one point- ing downward in the form of a dimer as schematized in Fig. 3.
In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface and have proposed that the active site is com- posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated one from the other by excess of phosphate species as schematised in Fig. 3.
Note that if such an assumption is true it is hard to under- stand how such activated oxygen species may be stable at high temperature and to understand the moving bed technology recently developed by the Du Pont researchers [ 11].
At variance the concept of four dimers as an active site seems reasonable and coherent with the scheme pro- posed by Ziolkowski [12] and Bordes [13].
Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- portant catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid (MAA).
This reaction is important as a first step to form methyl methacrylate monomer used for plexiglass or altuglass formation by polymerisa- tion.
The industrial type catalyst contains iron hydroxyphosphate of uncertain nature and Cs or NH 4 as additive and unfortunately necessitates a large amount of water in the feed (namely 10 to 12 mol H20 per mol of IBA) to remain stable with time on steam.
This makes this process difficult to be developed industrially.
Taking into account the phase diagram Fe203- FeO-P205 it could be possible to select and study several phases which contain Fe 2+, Fe 3+ or both cations able to insure the redox mecha- nism necessary for the reaction to take place as it was shown to proceed via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism [18].
It was shown that the active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2,composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octa- hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one from the other by PO 4 tetrahedra.
The active sites were shown to correspond to a group of two trimers facing each other on their respective P/P+Fe
The role of redox couple and of hydrox- ylation is shown below: Fe3+Fe 2+ (P207)2 HzO Fe3+Fe 2+ (PO3OH)4
400C 02 ---} Fe3+ x Fe_+ x(POaOH)4_ x(PO4) x
A study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibit- ing clusters of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes has been carried out.
It turns out that all catalysts were belonging after catalytic testing to the same solid solution of the type F3+ 1-- 2+(PO4)3(OH)3_3xO3 x with 0 < x < 1 e4_xt'e3x _ _ (Fig. 5).
Depending upon their composition these phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous chains (Fe2(PO4)O).
The results showed that all samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clus- ters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a.
The added water plays a role as for the active phase of the industrial catalyst in stabiliz- ing the hydroxylated catalysts and the redox couple is the same but implies O/OH instead of POa/PO3OH couple.
In a theoretical study using extended Hstickel molecular orbital calculation it has been shown that for iron octahedra assembled as dimers [19], trimers [20] or larger clusters there may occur electron exchange between Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + cations.
This occurs in the case of trimers but X=2 X=3 X>3
Fig. 6. Electron exchange between iron cations in (FeOt) n octahe- dra clusters calculated by extended Huckel molecular orbital theory (from [19] and [20]).
Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds.
For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons.
It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21].
The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters.
The main idea one may keep in mind from this study is that inorganic clusters of iron octa- hedra with iron at two oxidation states are ac- tive for the reaction studied and that one has to consider the active sites as these clusters, pref- erentially as ensemble of two trimers although other sizes (dimers, tetramers, pentamers...) are also active and selective but to a lesser extent.
The iron oxidation state is changing during the reaction in a similar way that the va/v 5 redox couple on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Section 4).
This again shows that metallic oxides have to be considered with a dynamical view during the oxidation reaction.
Supports are very often used in catalysis for several reasons, namely:(i) Dispersion of the active phase in order to increase the surface to volume ratio since het- erogeneous catalysis is occurring at the solid surface.
(ii) Heat transfer: this is a particularly impor- tant aspect in oxidation reactions because of the high exothermicity involved.
This holds particu- larly true at industrial scale since the hot spot problem is very crucial and should be monitored with precision within a few degrees to avoid local overactivity and subsequently overheating and presumably irreversible phase transforma- tion of the catalyst.
(iii) Attrition: this aspect is of main impor- tance for fluidized or solid transported beds.
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition.
(iv) Formation of new catalytic sites: this point will be emphasised below in some exam- ples.
One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties.
(v) Modification of the active phase proper- ties due to its chemical interaction with the support, including epitaxial induced modifica- tions.
In some cases the chemical effect of the support will be determining for catalytic proper- ties.
For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide supports (SiO 2, TiO 2, A1203) were shown by Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions as summarized in Table 2.
Different procedures may be used such as impregnation of silica with a molybdate salt or grafting molybdenum chloride or molybdenum based organometallic compounds such as Mo
An important parameter for the impregnation method is the pH of the molybdate solution.
As a matter of fact the following equilibrium has been well established: MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 2- + 8H +
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 z- species is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the polymeric heptamolybdate anion.
Moreover one defines the so-called isoelectric point of the support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a support by the pH value for which the surface charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to be adsorbed, respectively.
One has values of 2 for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc.
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. on the support itself.
Above the ieps value, the surface of a particular oxide is negatively charged and vice versa below.
The anion will thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps value and as said above a lower pH value will favor polymolybdate anionic species.
In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%.
The hydroxyl groups of the silica were observed by infrared and/or UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies to decrease in intensity with Mo loading and to disappear at 7 wt% Mo loading while two UV bands were appearing at 245 and 340 nm.
The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species.
The former band was observed to increase in intensity propor- tionally to Mo loading at low Mo loading and to saturate at roughly 3 wt% Mo.
The latter band was observed to appear near 2 wt% Mo, to increase proportionally to Mo content up to 7 wt% Mo and then to decrease slowly with Mo loading.
Catalytic properties were studied for two re- actions; namely isopropanol conversion and propene partial oxidation.
The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst.
One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air.
The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings.
This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7).
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8).
Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading.
At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed.
At very high Mo loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu- 2,0 1,5 Propana ' 1,0 0 o,5 Acrolein " 0,0 ,,,,,0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Mo loading (wt %) Fig. 8.

sively acrolein.
Propanal is known to stem from propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack.
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic.
Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic.
One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis.
This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction.
Such a catalyst is well known for several reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia.
The anatase form of TiO 2 appears to be better than the rutile form.
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 different European laboratories.
All results are assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1.
Surface vanadium species were observed to exist in three different forms: monomeric VO43- species,polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-
The following conclusions could be drawn considering that a polyvanadate species occu- pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 2) and an isolated monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 0.43 nm2):
(i) Monomeric VO 3- species exhibit acidic character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) and result in propene formation for isopropanol conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene oxidation.
Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% V205.
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride for o-xylene oxidation.
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total oxidation.
Vanadium oxide has been deposited on sev- eral supports as silica, alumina, titania but also zirconia, niobia, zirconium hydroxyphosphate,etc.
Its reductibility was studied by reduction by hydrogen at 400C.
It was observed that V on TiO 2 and /-A1203 was reduced rather fast and one reached a consumption such as an O/V atomic ratio near to 1 for TiO 2 and 0.65 for A1203 [25].
At variance for silica the reduction was much slower and an O/V ratio of 0.57 was obtained.
Such differences were interpreted by the authors as due to different species on the surface: mainly monomeric VO43- species for TiO z, dimeric species Vz O4- for /-A1203 (23) and V205 crystallites for silica [26].
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- tively and V10068 - or V10028H 5- with octahe- drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5.
Deposition of such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their initial structures depicted above were shown to remain stable even after calcination in flowing air at 500C and to be only partly modified after catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the 350 to 450C range.
Moreover in such cases, the selectivity towards propene was observed to be the same at the same con- version level, indicating that in this size domain of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity was not changed, only the activity was observed to increase with vanadium loading [27].
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 re- spectively or chains of limited size [28].
By comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar environment, it was suggested as for supported VO and CrO x species on zirconium hy- drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- mances were related to the stronger basic char- acter of PO 3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- ions.
Some general conclusions may be drawn from this general presentation:(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 12

Such ions exhibit an electrophilic or a nucleophilic character and therefore present different catalytic properties since the elec- trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of an aromatic ring.

A pecu- liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst.

Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties.
At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many par- tial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide.
It is thus clear that the size of these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active sites is important depending on the reaction considered and the support used.

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complex nature of the reaction mechanisms, which include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the stabilization of specific active sites that favor desired reactions over undesired side reactions. The size of the active sites, as well as their electronic and geometric properties, significantly impact the selectivity and conversion rates in ODH reactions.
