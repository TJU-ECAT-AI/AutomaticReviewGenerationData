[1] "The concepts of oxidation began with Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory in 1773. One usually defines two groups of reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The first type involves radicals formed by homolytic * Corresponding author. cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type involves an active oxygen compound or a metal ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step."
[2] "The mechanism involves the pres- ence of two types of distinct active sites: an active cationic site which oxidises the substrate and another site active for dioxygen reduction."
[3] "An adequate structure of the material should also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species transfer."
[4] "It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reac- tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned."
[5] "Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- ties."
[6] "Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring."
[7] "Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- hydrogenation of olefins."
[8] "Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative breaking)."
[9] "Such a concept has been introduced by Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 ], or early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at present."
[10] "A more precise analysis and characterization of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown in Fig. 2 [5]."
[11] "It is then suggested that the propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al- Table 1 Structure sensitivity of the different faces of MoO 3 crystals in olefin oxidation at 380C ([4]) Reactant olefin products Relative selectivity per faces Reactant olefin Products Basal (010) Side (100) Apical (101), (1) Propene Acrolein"

[15] "Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- portant catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid (MAA)."
[16] "It was shown that the active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2,composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 6 octa- hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one from the other by PO 4 tetrahedra."
[17] "The active sites were shown to correspond to a group of two trimers facing each other on their respective P/P+Fe"

[21] "A study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibit- ing clusters of face sharing FeO 6 octahedra of different sizes has been carried out."
[22] "It turns out that all catalysts were belonging after catalytic testing to the same solid solution of the type F3+ 1-- 2+(PO4)3(OH)3_3xO3 x with 0 < x < 1 e4_xt'e3x _ _ (Fig. 5)."
[23] "Depending upon their composition these phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous chains (Fe2(PO4)O)."
[24] "The results showed that all samples were active and selective for the reaction even for the different sizes of the clus- ters but the optimum activity and selectivity were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 called barbosalite and containing limited size clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 4a."
[25] "Such clusters of FeO 6 octahedra also exist in other inorganic compounds."
[26] "For instance they exist in ilvaite (CaFe 3 + FeZ2 Si207OOH) where silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 6 octahedra form ribbons."
[27] "It is interesting to note that such material is active and selective for the reaction although to a lesser extent than the previous hydroxyphosphates [21]."
[28] "The lower catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence of Ca 2+ cations in the structure and/or to the silicate counter anion whose basicity in the sense of Pearson is different from that of the phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of FeO 6 octahedra clusters."
[29] "One very usually uses silica or carborundum as a binder or as a coating to limit attrition."
[30] "One will see that well dispersed species of limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- liar catalytic properties."
[31] "In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading was varied up to about 20 wt%."
[32] "The former band may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric species and the latter one to octahedral poly- meric (polymolybdate) species."
[33] "The first reaction is a test reaction which allows the characterization of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a catalyst."
[34] "One gets dehydration to propene or di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in the presence of air."
[35] "The experimental results at 100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings acidic features are favored while redox features are favored at higher loadings."
[36] "This indicates that monomeric MoO 2- species are acidic (pre- sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 7)."
[37] "The second reaction studied is propene oxida- tion at 380C (see Fig. 8)."
[38] "Weak activity was observed for low Mo loading."
[39] "At higher Mo loading propanal was the major product while acrolein was also observed."

[42] "These results indicate that monomeric MoO 2- species does not oxidize propene in our condi- tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- ing rather electrophilic."
[43] "Molybdenum oxide ex- hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being rather nucleophilic."
[44] "One can thus realise how the size of the active site is important in oxida- tion catalysis."
[45] "This is typical of structure sensi- tive reaction."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The reaction mechanisms typically involve the activation of C-H bonds, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the selectivity and conversion rates, which are determined by the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The size of the active site is a critical factor in oxidation catalysis, as it affects the catalytic properties and the selectivity of the catalyst. Structure-sensitive reactions, such as ODH, are particularly influenced by the size and arrangement of the active sites on the catalyst surface.
