Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor14."
[2] "Moreover, in several of these processes the required oxidant is N2O rather than O2."
[3] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."
[4] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."
[5] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

1.The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are formed by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

1.甲烷的部分氧化以生产更有用的化学品，如甲醇、乙烯和苯，已经广泛研究，但这些产品的产量一直很低。在一些过程中，N2O被用作氧化剂，而不是O2。我们实验室最近的研究表明，锂掺杂的氧化镁（Li/MgO）在O2的存在下，对从CH4中提取氢形成·CH3自由基具有高活性。这表明C2H6和C2H4（C2化合物）是由在该催化剂上形成的两个气态·CH3自由基的耦合产生的。我们在常规催化条件下，从CH4转化中获得了C2化合物的高产量。
