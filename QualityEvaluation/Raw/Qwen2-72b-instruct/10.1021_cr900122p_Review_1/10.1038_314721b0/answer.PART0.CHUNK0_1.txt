1.The partial oxidation of methane to produce more useful chemicals like methanol, ethylene, and benzene has been widely studied, but the yields of these products have been low. In some processes, N2O is used as the oxidant instead of O2. Recent research in our lab has shown that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has a high capacity for hydrogen abstraction from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals. This indicates that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are generated by the coupling of two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst. We have achieved high yields of C2 compounds from CH4 conversion under conventional catalytic conditions.

1.甲烷的部分氧化以生产更有用的化学品，如甲醇、乙烯和苯，已经广泛研究，但这些产品的产量一直很低。在一些过程中，N2O被用作氧化剂，而不是O2。我们实验室最近的研究表明，锂掺杂的氧化镁（Li/MgO）在O2的存在下，对从CH4中提取氢形成·CH3自由基具有高活性。这表明C2H6和C2H4（C2化合物）是由在该催化剂上形成的两个气态·CH3自由基的耦合产生的。我们在常规催化条件下，成功地从CH4转化中获得了C2化合物的高产量。
