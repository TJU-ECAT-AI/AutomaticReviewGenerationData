1.The document does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The coupling of two methyl radicals leads to the formation of ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700°C. The low surface area of the catalyst favored high C2 selectivity by limiting the reaction of methyl radicals with surface O2- ions, which leads to the formation of CO and CO2.

1.文档没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战或建议的反应机制的具体信息。但是,它确实讨论了锂促进的氧化镁作为催化剂,用于分子氧对甲烷的部分氧化。该催化剂在相对较高的转化率下,以高选择性有效地产生了乙烷和乙烯。反应机制涉及通过催化剂表面的[Li'O-]中心从甲烷中提取氢原子形成甲基自由基。两个甲基自由基的耦合导致乙烷的形成,乙烷可以进一步氧化为乙烯。C2产品的选择性和甲烷的转化率随着反应温度的升高而增加,直到大约700°C。催化剂的低表面积通过限制甲基自由基与表面O2-离子的反应,有利于高C2选择性,这导致CO和CO2的形成。
