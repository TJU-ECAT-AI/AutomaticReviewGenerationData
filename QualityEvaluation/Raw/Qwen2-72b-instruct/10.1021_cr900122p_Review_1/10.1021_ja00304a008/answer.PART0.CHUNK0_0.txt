1.The document does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does discuss the use of lithium-promoted magnesium oxide as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen. The catalyst was effective in producing ethane and ethylene with high selectivity at relatively high conversions. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of methyl radicals through the reaction of methane with [Li'O-] centers on the catalyst surface. The selectivity for C2 products and the conversion of methane both increased with increasing reaction temperature up to about 700 °C. Low surface areas favored high C2 selectivities due to the dominant pathway of reacting CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2. The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst that does not contain metal ions with variable oxidation states.

1.文档没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)、各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战或提出的反应机制的具体信息。但是,它确实讨论了锂促进的氧化镁作为催化剂,用于分子氧对甲烷的部分氧化。该催化剂在相对较高的转化率下,以高选择性有效地产生了乙烷和乙烯。反应机制涉及通过甲烷与催化剂表面的[Li'O-]中心的反应形成甲基自由基。C2产品的选择性和甲烷的转化率都随着反应温度的升高而增加,直到大约700°C。由于与表面O2-离子反应的CH3.导致CO和CO2等不希望的产品的主导途径,低表面积有利于高C2选择性。Li/MgO系统是一种新型氧化催化剂,不含具有可变氧化态的金属离子。
