[1] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."
[2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2C4 alkanes."
[4] "The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed."
[5] "It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions."
[6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
[7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[9] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[10] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
[11] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
[12] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."
[13] "The results reported in the bibliography indicate that the dispersion of the vanadium oxide as well as its structure can be understood on the basis of the different acid-base character of the different supports."
[14] "The acidity of the metal oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge (point of zero charge, pzc)."
[15] "The agglomeration of vanadium oxide species to form V205 crystallites is favored with the acid character of the support."
[16] "Moreover, the structure of the vanadium species depends on the acid-base nature of the metal oxide support [40,54]."
[17] "In this way, while crystalline V2Os-like structures are obtained at relatively low vanadium coverages (10% of the theoretical monolayer) on an acid metal oxide as SiO2 [61], metal vanadates are formed, at relatively high vanadium content and surface coverages of the support, on basic metal oxide supports [57]."
[18] "The importance of acid-base character of metal oxide support on the dispersion and the nature of metal anions have also been observed during the preparation of other supported metal oxide catalysts [54,58]."
[19] "The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement with their acid character."
[20] "The dispersion and nature of the VOx species formed in catalysts with low V contents are also determined by the acidity of the metal oxide used as support."
[21] "The appearance of V205 crystallites is only observed at vanadium oxide coverages above 60 (A1203) or 100% (TiO2) of the theoretical monolayer [61]."
[22] "On the most basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO-supported vanadia catalysts,isolated VO4 tetrahedra without bridging V-O-V oxygen ions (Q(O type) forming Mg3V2Os-like structures are observed within a larger range of V content [25-32]."
[23] "The V 5+ species formed on MgO can be understood on the basis of the strong interaction between the V-atoms and the support leading to highly dispersed vanadium species at low coverages [75],and to the formation of crystalline Mg vanadates when the vanadium content increases."
[24] "A vanadium oxide dispersion intermediate between those on MgO and AlaO3 or SiO2 has been observed in catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite [45,75] and on sepiolite [46,47,76], since they show an intermediate acid character [56]."
[25] "Although the characteristics of the VOfitydrotalcite catalyst resemble that of VOx/MgO catalyst, the 51V NMR spectra suggest a higher heterogeneity of vanadium sites and tetrahedral V 5+ species with different number of bridging oxygen ions (probably of Q(0 and Q() types) [28,75]."
[26] "The results obtained for vanadia supported on mixed metal oxides suggest that it is possible to control the structure and reactivity of the vanadia monolayers by modifying the local structure of the oxide support."
[27] "The results reported in this Table show that the higher the coordination number and the aggregation state of vanadium species, the higher the O-insertion power is."
[28] "In addition, the presence of V=O bond help to incorporate oxygen species into the hydrocarbon chain."
[29] "However, olefins are formed at low n-butane conversions and high butane/oxygen ratio on (VO)2P207 [1], the most selective catalyst in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, indicating that the H-abstraction step also occurs [122]."
[30] "In the selective catalysts in ODH reactions, that permit to obtain moderate selectivities to olefins at relatively high alkane conversions, mainly tetrahedral (isolated and/or dymeric) vS+-species are present."
[31] "The importance of the coordination number of vanadium species on the nature of selective oxidation reactions can also be concluded from the results obtained, at low and high vanadium content, on both VOxJA1203 or VOx]SiO2."
[32] "At low V- loading, they are selective in the ODH of ethane and n-butane."
[33] "However, on catalysts with vanadium loading higher than 50% of the theoretical monolayer (in which octahedral V 5+ species with V=O bonds as in V205 are mainly observed), show a poor selectivity to olefins during the oxidation of ethane (COx are mainly formed) [95,97] or n-butane and n-pentane (in which maleic anhydride is mainly observed) [123]."
[34] "Since, it has been observed that the selectivity to maleic anhydride during the oxidation of benzene [116], 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene [116,124] and furan [125] on supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases when increasing the vanadium loading (from 0 to 5 layers of V205) it can be concluded that V=O double bond is necessary for the O-insertion [17-21,116,120]."
[35] "However, two adjacent V=O double bonds units are not necessary for obtaining not only oxydehydrogenation products but also O-containing partial oxidation compounds."
[36] "In fact, it is know that n-butane [126] and n-pentane [127] are selectively oxidized to maleic anhydride using molybdovanadophosphoric acids as catalysts, in which isolated V=O double bond units are the active and selective sites."
[37] "However, and in addition to the presence of V=O double bonds, the presence of acid sites are necessary on selective catalysts for the formation of O-containing product as they facilites the desorption of partial oxidation products."
[38] "On selective ODH catalysts the presence of acid-base pairs can optimize the formation of olefins [104,105] In conclusion, supported vanadium oxide catalysts appear to be selective materials in the ODH reactions."
[39] "Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support."
[40] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support."
[41] "In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."
[42] "However, the presence of V=O double bonds, which occurs on catalysts with high vanadium content, appears to be responsible for the selective O-insertion reactions."
[43] "The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions.
2.Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. The catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can alter its redox properties. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. Despite the variety of catalytic systems studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion.
3.The dispersion and structure of vanadium oxide can be understood based on the acid-base character of the support. The acidity of metal oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge (point of zero charge, pzc). The agglomeration of vanadium oxide species to form V2O5 crystallites is favored with the acid character of the support. The structure of the vanadium species depends on the acid-base nature of the metal oxide support. The dispersion and nature of the VOx species formed in catalysts with low V contents are determined by the acidity of the metal oxide support. Isolated VO4 tetrahedra are observed on basic metal oxide supports, such as MgO, within a larger range of V content. The V 5+ species formed on MgO can be understood based on the strong interaction between the V-atoms and the support, leading to highly dispersed vanadium species at low coverages and the formation of crystalline Mg vanadates when the vanadium content increases. A vanadium oxide dispersion intermediate between those on MgO and Al2O3 or SiO2 has been observed in catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite and sepiolite, which show an intermediate acid character.
4.The coordination number and aggregation state of vanadium species have a significant impact on the O-insertion power. The presence of a V=O bond facilitates the incorporation of oxygen species into the hydrocarbon chain. Olefins are formed at low n-butane conversions and high butane/oxygen ratio on (VO)2P2O7, the most selective catalyst in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, indicating that the H-abstraction step also occurs. In selective catalysts for ODH reactions, moderate selectivities to olefins can be obtained at relatively high alkane conversions, mainly due to the presence of tetrahedral (isolated and/or dymeric) vS+-species. The importance of the coordination number of vanadium species on the nature of selective oxidation reactions can be concluded from the results obtained at low and high vanadium content on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/SiO2. At low V loading, they are selective in the ODH of ethane and n-butane. However, on catalysts with high vanadium loading, octahedral V 5+ species with V=O bonds are mainly observed, resulting in poor selectivity to olefins during the oxidation of ethane and n-butane. The selectivity to maleic anhydride during the oxidation of benzene, 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, and furan on supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with increasing vanadium loading, indicating that a V=O double bond is necessary for O-insertion. Two adjacent V=O double bonds are not necessary for obtaining oxydehydrogenation products or O-containing partial oxidation compounds. N-butane and n-pentane can be selectively oxidized to maleic anhydride using molybdovanadophosphoric acids as catalysts, where isolated V=O double bond units are the active and selective sites. Acid sites are necessary on selective catalysts for the formation of O-containing products, as they facilitate the desorption of partial oxidation products. On selective ODH catalysts, the presence of acid-base pairs can optimize the formation of olefins.
5.Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are selective materials in ODH reactions. Factors contributing to their catalytic behavior include the coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites, and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support. The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. Vanadium should be stabilized in a low coordination number to limit the consecutive reactions of formed olefins. However, the presence of V=O double bonds, which occurs on catalysts with high vanadium content, appears to be responsible for selective O-insertion reactions. The environment of the V-species plays a crucial role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. The appearance of acid and/or basic sites, which strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed. The rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and olefin desorption depends on the acid-base character of catalysts, and they can be considered as selectivity determining steps.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)受金属氧化物载体的酸碱性的影响，这会影响钒在表面的分散以及钒物种的性质。表面钒氧化物物种的还原性和结构，以及催化剂的酸碱性，对于C2-C4烷烃的ODH催化性能至关重要。四面体VS+-物种是C2-C4烷烃ODH的活性和选择性位点。表面钒氧化物物种的配位数和聚集状态，以及酸/碱位的存在，对支撑钒氧化物催化剂的催化行为起着重要作用。这些因素对于开发ODH反应中的选择性催化剂至关重要。
2.支撑金属氧化物具有更高的机械强度、更好的热稳定性和更大的表面积等优点。然而，支撑钒氧化物的催化行为受到金属氧化物载体的性质和钒负载的影响。将钒氧化物与其它金属氧化物混合或支撑在其它金属氧化物上，可以增强V2O5在短链烷烃ODH中的选择性，增加所需烯烃的生成速率。块体和支撑钒催化剂的催化性能通常与V-物种的配位和环境的修改有关，这可以改变其氧化还原性质。钒物种的性质和催化行为取决于金属氧化物载体。尽管研究了各种催化系统，但短链烷烃ODH的反应机制和选择性位点的性质仍然存在争议。
3.钒氧化物的分散和结构可以根据载体的酸碱性来理解。金属氧化物的酸性与表面零电荷点(pzc)的pH值有关。随着载体的酸性增强，钒氧化物物种聚集形成V2O5晶体的趋势增加。钒物种的结构取决于金属氧化物载体的酸碱性质。在低V含量的催化剂中，VOx物种的分散和性质也受到金属氧化物载体酸性的决定。在最基础的金属氧化物载体上，如MgO支撑的钒催化剂，在较宽的V含量范围内观察到无桥接V-O-V氧离子的VO4四面体(Q(O型)，形成Mg3V2O8类结构。在MgO上形成的V 5+物种可以基于V原子与载体之间的强相互作用来理解，这导致在低覆盖度下形成高度分散的钒物种，当钒含量增加时形成结晶Mg钒酸盐。在支撑于煅烧水滑石和皂石的催化剂中观察到介于MgO和Al2O3或SiO2之间的钒氧化物分散，因为它们显示出中间酸性。
4.钒物种的配位数和聚集状态对O插入能力有显著影响。V=O键的存在有助于将氧物种引入碳氢化合物链。在(VO)2P2O7上，在低n-丁烷转化率和高丁烷/氧气比下形成烯烃，这是n-丁烷氧化到马来酸酐的最选择性催化剂，表明H-抽象步骤也发生。在ODH反应的选择性催化剂中，可以在相对较高的烷烃转化率下获得对烯烃的适度选择性，这主要是由于存在四面体(孤立和/或二聚体)vS+-物种。从在低和高钒含量下在VOx/Al2O3和VOx/SiO2上获得的结果可以得出，钒物种的配位数对选择性氧化反应的性质有重要影响。在低V负载下，它们在乙烷和n-丁烷的ODH中具有选择性。然而，在高钒负载的催化剂上，主要观察到具有V=O键的八面体V 5+物种，导致在乙烷和n-丁烷的氧化中对烯烃的选择性较差。在支撑钒氧化物催化剂上，苯、1-丁烯、1,3-丁二烯和呋喃的氧化中，马来酸酐的选择性随着钒负载的增加而增加，表明V=O双键对于O插入是必要的。两个相邻的V=O双键单元对于获得不仅氧化脱氢产物，还有含氧部分氧化化合物并不是必需的。使用钼钒磷酸盐作为催化剂，n-丁烷和n-戊烷可以被选择性氧化为马来酸酐，其中孤立的V=O双键单元是活性和选择性位点。在选择性催化剂上形成含氧产物需要酸位的存在，因为它们有助于部分氧化产物的解吸。在选择性ODH催化剂上，酸碱对的存在可以优化烯烃的形成。
5.支撑钒氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中是选择性材料。影响其催化行为的因素包括配位数和活性位点之间的距离(钒物种的分散)、活性位点的还原性以及催化剂和金属氧化物载体的酸碱性。设计新的催化系统时应考虑，钒必须在金属氧化物载体上高度分散。此外，从最具选择性的催化剂中得出结论，钒必须稳定在低配位数，以限制形成的烯烃的连续反应。然而，V=O双键的存在，这发生在高钒含量的催化剂上，似乎对选择性O插入反应负责。V-物种的环境在支撑钒氧化物催化剂的催化行为中起着重要作用。桥接V-O-载体氧离子的强度和还原性决定了这些材料的催化活性。此外，酸性和/或碱性位点的出现，这在很大程度上取决于金属氧化物载体的性质，决定了根据烷烃的喂入而选择性地进行氧化脱氢产物。似乎形成烯烃中间体的速率和烯烃的解吸取决于催化剂的酸碱性，它们可以被认为是选择性决定步骤。
