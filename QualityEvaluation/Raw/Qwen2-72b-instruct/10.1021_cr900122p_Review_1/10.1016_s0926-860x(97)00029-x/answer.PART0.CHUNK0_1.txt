[2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2C4 alkanes."
[4] "The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed."
[5] "It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions."
[6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
[7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[9] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[10] "The results reported in the bibliography indicate that the dispersion of the vanadium oxide as well as its structure can be understood on the basis of the different acid-base character of the different supports."
[11] "The acidity of the metal oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge (point of zero charge, pzc)."
[12] "The results can be explained by the acid character of the vanadium oxide (see above) that can easily interact and react with basic oxides, whereas a weaker interaction with another acid oxide will favor the agglomeration of the VOx units to form V205."
[13] "The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement with their acid character."
[14] "The characteristics of the VOfitydrotalcite catalyst resemble that of VOx/MgO catalyst, the 51V NMR spectra suggest a higher heterogeneity of vanadium sites and tetrahedral V 5+ species with different number of bridging oxygen ions (probably of Q(0 and Q() types)."
[15] "The results obtained for vanadia supported on mixed metal oxides suggest that it is possible to control the structure and reactivity of the vanadia monolayers by modifying the local structure of the oxide support."
[16] "However, in some cases, the final surface vanadium concentration depends not only on the vanadium content, but also on possible modifications of the support during the impregnation and/or calcination steps."

[23] "The most selective catalysts were obtained when vanadia was supported on basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO, Bi203, La203 and Sm203,while worse catalytic properties were observed for those supported on acid metal oxides (SiO2, TiO2, A1203), suggesting a parallelism between the appearance of Me vanadates (and the absence of V205) and the selectivity to olefins."
[24] "Then, it was concluded that the use of basic metal oxides induced the formation of tetrahedral V 5+ species which could be considered as the selective sites in the ODH of alkanes."

[26] "In addition, the presence of V=O bond help to incorporate oxygen species into the hydrocarbon chain."
[27] "However, olefins are formed at low n-butane conversions and high butane/oxygen ratio on (VO)2P207 [1], the most selective catalyst in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, indicating that the H-abstraction step also occurs [122]."
[28] "In the selective catalysts in ODH reactions, that permit to obtain moderate selectivities to olefins at relatively high alkane conversions, mainly tetrahedral (isolated and/or dymeric) vS+-species are present."

[31] "However, on catalysts with vanadium loading higher than 50% of the theoretical monolayer (in which octahedral V 5+ species with V=O bonds as in V205 are mainly observed), show a poor selectivity to olefins during the oxidation of ethane (COx are mainly formed) [95,97] or n-butane and n-pentane (in which maleic anhydride is mainly observed) [123]."
[32] "Since, it has been observed that the selectivity to maleic anhydride during the oxidation of benzene [116], 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene [116,124] and furan [125] on supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases when increasing the vanadium loading (from 0 to 5 layers of V205) it can be concluded that V=O double bond is necessary for the O-insertion [17-21,116,120]."
[33] "However, two adjacent V=O double bonds units are not necessary for obtaining not only oxydehydrogenation products but also O-containing partial oxidation compounds."
[34] "In fact, it is know that n-butane [126] and n-pentane [127] are selectively oxidized to maleic anhydride using molybdovanadophosphoric acids as catalysts, in which isolated V=O double bond units are the active and selective sites."
[35] "However, and in addition to the presence of V=O double bonds, the presence of acid sites are necessary on selective catalysts for the formation of O-containing product as they facilites the desorption of partial oxidation products."

1.The acid-base character of the metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of vanadium species, which in turn affects the catalytic properties in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number, aggregation state, and presence of acid/base sites on the surface vanadium oxide species are crucial factors for the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The dispersion and structure of vanadium oxide on the support are determined by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support. The selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins. The catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. The dispersion of vanadium oxide and its structure can be understood based on the acid-base character of the support. The acidity of metal oxides is related to the pH at which the surface possesses zero surface charge. The characteristics of catalysts supported on A1203 and TiO2 are in agreement with their acid character. The characteristics of the VOx/hydrotalcite catalyst resemble that of VOx/MgO catalyst, but with a higher heterogeneity of vanadium sites and tetrahedral V 5+ species with different numbers of bridging oxygen ions. The results suggest that it is possible to control the structure and reactivity of the vanadia monolayers by modifying the local structure of the oxide support. The final surface vanadium concentration depends not only on the vanadium content but also on possible modifications of the support during the impregnation and/or calcination steps. The structure of TiO2 and ZrO2 can be transformed during the calcination step, and these modifications are generally enhanced in the presence of vanadia. Modifications of the support during the calcination step are also observed in natural sepiolite or Mg-Al hydrotalcite-like materials used as supports. Some modification of the support was observed on vanadia supported on microporous AIPO4-5 materials or amorphous aluminophosphates.

The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials.

1.金属氧化物载体的酸碱性影响了钒在载体表面的分散和钒物种的性质，这反过来影响了C2-C4烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的催化性能。表面钒氧化物种的配位数、聚集状态和酸/碱位的存在是支撑钒氧化催化剂催化行为的关键因素。四面体VS+-物种是C2-C4烷烃ODH的活性和选择性位点。钒氧化物在支撑物上的分散和结构由金属氧化物支撑的酸碱性决定。当钒氧化物与其它金属氧化物混合或支撑时，V2O5在短链烷烃ODH中的选择性增强，增加了所需烯烃的形成速率。支撑钒氧化物的催化行为受金属氧化物支撑的性质和钒负载量的影响。钒氧化物的分散和结构可以根据支撑物的酸碱性来理解。金属氧化物的酸性与表面零电荷的pH值有关。支撑在A1203和TiO2上的催化剂的特性与其酸性一致。VOx/hydrotalcite催化剂的特性与VOx/MgO催化剂相似，但具有更高异质性的钒位点和不同数量桥接氧离子的四面体V 5+物种。结果表明，通过修改氧化支撑物的局部结构，可以控制钒单层的结构和反应性。最终表面钒浓度不仅取决于钒含量，还取决于在浸渍和/或煅烧步骤中支撑物可能的修改。TiO2和ZrO2的结构可以在煅烧步骤中改变，这些修改通常在存在钒酸盐时增强。在用作支撑的天然sepiolite或Mg-Al类水滑石材料中，也观察到了支撑物在煅烧步骤中的变化。在支撑在微孔AIPO4-5材料或无定形铝磷酸盐上的钒酸盐中观察到了一些支撑物的修改。块状钒氧化物在部分还原状态下具有大量可移动的氧库。当钒氧化物与氧化镁结合或混合时，获得了n-丁烷和丙烷ODH的活性和选择性催化系统。使用碱性金属氧化物诱导了四面体V 5+物种的形成，这可以被认为是烷烃ODH的选择性位点。钒物种的配位数和聚集状态越高，氧插入能力越强。V=O键的存在有助于将氧物种掺入碳氢化合物链中。然而，在(VO)2P207上，在低n-丁烷转化率和高丁烷/氧比率下形成了烯烃，(VO)2P207是n-丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的最具选择性的催化剂，这表明H-抽象步骤也发生了。在ODH反应中，主要存在四面体(孤立和/或二聚体)vS+-物种。从在低和高钒含量下在VOx/A1203或VOx/SiO2上获得的结果可以得出，钒物种的配位数对选择性氧化反应的性质有重要影响。在低V负载下，它们在乙烷和n-丁烷的ODH中具有选择性。然而，在理论单层以上50%的钒负载量的催化剂上，在乙烷氧化或n-丁烷和n-戊烷氧化中观察到对烯烃的差选择性。在支撑钒氧化物催化剂上，苯、1-丁烯、1,3-丁二烯和糠醛氧化过程中马来酸酐的选择性随钒含量的增加而增加，表明V=O双键对于氧插入是必要的。然而，两个相邻的V=O双键单元对于获得不仅氧化脱氢产物，还有含氧部分氧化化合物并不是必需的。在选择性催化剂上，酸位的存在对于形成含氧产物是必要的，因为它们促进了部分氧化产物的解吸。在选择性ODH催化剂上，酸碱对的存在可以优化烯烃的形成。V-物种的环境在支撑钒氧化催化剂的催化行为中起着重要作用。桥接V-O-支撑氧离子的强度和还原性决定了这些材料的催化活性。酸性和/或碱性位点的出现，这在很大程度上取决于金属氧化物支撑的性质，决定了根据烷烃进料的氧化脱氢产物的选择性。催化剂的酸碱性决定了烯烃中间体的形成速率和烯烃的解吸速率，它们可以被认为是选择性决定步骤。
