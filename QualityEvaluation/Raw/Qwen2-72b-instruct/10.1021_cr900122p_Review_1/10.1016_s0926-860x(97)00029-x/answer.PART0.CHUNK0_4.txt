[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins,the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."
[2] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[4] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
[5] "However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet."
[6] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[7] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
[8] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
[9] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
[10] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process that has gained attention as an alternative to classical dehydrogenations due to its potential to achieve significant conversion at lower temperatures. Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in various catalytic reactions, including the ODH of alkanes. The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)作为一种替代经典脱氢反应的途径，因其在较低温度下实现显著转化的潜力而受到关注。据报道，支撑的钒氧化物在各种催化反应中是选择性催化剂，包括烷烃的ODH。支撑金属氧化物的优点包括更高的机械强度、更好的热稳定性和更大的表面积。然而，支撑钒氧化物的催化行为受到金属氧化物支撑物的性质和钒负载量的影响。将钒氧化物与其他金属氧化物混合或支撑在其他金属氧化物上可以增强V2O5在短链烷烃ODH中的选择性，增加所需烯烃的形成速率。钒-镁混合氧化物(VMgO)和V-Mo-Nb-O混合氧化物在n-丁烷、丙烷和乙烷的ODH中对烯烃显示出高选择性。尽管研究了各种催化系统，但短链烷烃ODH中活性和选择性位点的性质仍处于讨论中。块体和支撑钒氧化物催化剂的不同催化性质通常与V-物种的配位和环境的修改有关，这可以改变其氧化还原性质。为了更好地建立支撑的影响，已经致力于研究单层系统(在其中氧化物受支撑影响最大的单分子分散)以优化活性位点的分散。从这些研究中可以得出结论，钒物种的性质和催化行为取决于金属氧化物支撑物。然而，尽管研究了各种催化系统，短链烷烃ODH的反应机制和选择性位点的性质仍在讨论中。本文的目的是总结在支撑钒氧化物催化剂上短链烷烃ODH中获得的催化结果，以及不同催化系统的结构和性质，以理解钒氧化物催化剂中活性和选择性位点的性质。
