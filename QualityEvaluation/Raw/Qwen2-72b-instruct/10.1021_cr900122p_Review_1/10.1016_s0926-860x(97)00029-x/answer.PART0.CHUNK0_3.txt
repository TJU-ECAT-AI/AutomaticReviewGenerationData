[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins,the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."
[2] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
[3] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
[4] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
[5] "However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet."
[6] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
[7] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
[8] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
[9] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
[10] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a process that has been studied using various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Supported vanadium oxides have shown selectivity in catalytic reactions such as the oxidation of methanol, methane, and olefins, as well as the selective catalytic reduction of NOx. The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH of various alkanes. Despite the study of several catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in ODH reactions is not yet fully understood. The catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can alter its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion. The structure-activity/selectivity correlation is expected to change with the alkane fed, and the aim is to summarize the catalytic results and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)过程已经使用了各种催化剂进行研究，包括块体金属氧化物和支撑系统。支撑的钒氧化物在甲醇、甲烷和烯烃的氧化以及NOx的有选择性催化还原等催化反应中显示出选择性。支撑金属氧化物的优点包括更高的机械强度、更好的热稳定性和更大的表面积。然而，支撑的钒氧化物的催化行为受到金属氧化物支撑物的性质和钒负载量的影响。将钒氧化物与其它金属氧化物混合或支撑在其它金属氧化物上可以增强块体V2O5在短链烷烃的ODH中的选择性，增加所需烯烃的形成速率。钒-镁混合氧化物(VMgO)和V-Mo-Nb-O混合氧化物已被证明是各种烷烃ODH中的选择性催化剂。尽管研究了几个催化系统，但ODH反应中活性和选择性位点的性质尚未完全理解。块体和支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的催化性质通常与V-物种的配位和环境的修改有关，这可以改变其氧化还原性质。为了更好地建立支撑的影响，已经致力于研究单层系统(在其中氧化物受支撑影响最大的单分子分散)以优化活性位点的分散。从这些研究中可以得出结论，钒物种的性质和催化行为都取决于金属氧化物支撑物。然而，尽管研究了各种催化系统，短链烷烃ODH的反应机制和选择性位点的性质仍在讨论中。由于结构-活性/选择性相关性可能随烷烃的供给而变化，本文的目的是总结在支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上短链烷烃ODH中获得的催化结果，以及不同催化系统的结构和性质，以理解钒氧化物催化剂中活性和选择性位点的性质。
