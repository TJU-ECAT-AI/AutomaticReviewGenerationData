          [1] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."
          [2] "The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species and the acid-base character of catalysts, in addition to their catalytic properties in the ODH of Cz-C4 alkanes, strongly depend on the metal oxide used as support and the vanadium loading."
          [3] "In this way, it appears that tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2C4 alkanes."
          [4] "The effect of the coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites on the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts are discussed."
          [5] "It is concluded that these are important factors that must be considered to develop selective catalysts in ODH reactions."
          [6] "The advantages of supported metal oxides include higher mechanical strength,better thermal stability and larger surface area."
          [7] "However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is modified by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading."
          [8] "In this way, the selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."
          [9] "This is the case of vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO), that show a high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane [25,27,28], propane [26,29-31] and ethylben- zene [32]; or V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides which are selective catalysts in the ODH of ethane [33,34]."
          [10] "More recently, it has also been shown that V-containing molecular sieves are highly selective for the oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane [35,36] and propane [37-39]."
          [11] "However, although several catalytic system have been studied [17-21], the nature of the active and selective sites is not well known yet."
          [12] "The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species which can modify its redox properties."
          [13] "In order to better establish the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the study of monolayer systems (monomolecular dispersion in which the oxide is maximally influenced by the support) to optimize the dispersion of the active sites [13-16]."
          [14] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."
          [15] "However, in spite of the variety of catalytic system studied, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under discussion."
          [16] "Since the structure-activity/selectivity correlation could be expected to change with the alkane fed, the aim of the present paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as the structure and properties of different catalytic systems, in order to understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by the acid-base character of the metal oxide support, which affects the dispersion of vanadium on the surface and the nature of the vanadium species. The reducibility and structure of surface vanadium oxide species, as well as the acid-base character of catalysts, are crucial for the catalytic properties in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. Tetrahedral VS+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes. The coordination number and aggregation state of surface vanadium oxide species, and the presence of acid/base sites, play a significant role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These factors are essential for developing selective catalysts in ODH reactions. Supported metal oxides offer advantages such as higher mechanical strength, better thermal stability, and larger surface area. However, the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide is influenced by the nature of the metal oxide support and the vanadium loading. Mixing or supporting vanadium oxide on other metal oxides can enhance the selectivity of bulk V2O5 in the ODH of short chain alkanes, increasing the formation rate of desired olefins. Vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides (VMgO) and V-Mo-Nb-O mixed oxides have shown high selectivity to olefins in the ODH of n-butane, propane, and ethane. V-containing molecular sieves have also shown high selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidation of ethane and propane. Despite the study of various catalytic systems, the nature of the active and selective sites in the ODH of short chain alkanes is still under discussion. The different catalytic properties of bulk and supported vanadia catalysts are related to modifications in the coordination and environment of V-species, which can affect its redox properties. Monolayer systems have been studied to optimize the dispersion of active sites and understand the influence of the support. The nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support. However, the reaction mechanism and nature of the selective sites for the ODH of short chain alkanes are still under investigation. The aim of the paper is to summarize the catalytic results obtained during the ODH of short chain alkanes on supported vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the nature of active and selective sites in vanadia catalysts.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)受金属氧化物载体的酸碱性的影响，这会影响钒在表面的分散以及钒物种的性质。表面钒氧化物物种的还原性和结构，以及催化剂的酸碱性，对于C2-C4烷烃的ODH催化性能至关重要。四面体VS+-物种是C2-C4烷烃ODH的活性和选择性位点。表面钒氧化物物种的配位数和聚集状态，以及酸/碱位的存在，对支撑钒氧化物催化剂的催化行为起着重要作用。这些因素对于开发ODH反应中的选择性催化剂至关重要。支撑金属氧化物具有更高的机械强度、更好的热稳定性和更大的表面积等优点。然而，支撑钒氧化物的催化行为受到金属氧化物载体的性质和钒负载的影响。将钒氧化物与其他金属氧化物混合或支撑在其他金属氧化物上可以增强V2O5在短链烷烃ODH中的选择性，增加所需烯烃的形成速率。钒-镁混合氧化物(VMgO)和V-Mo-Nb-O混合氧化物在n-丁烷、丙烷和乙烷的ODH中对烯烃显示出高选择性。含V的分子筛在乙烷和丙烷氧化过程中对氧化脱氢产物也显示出高选择性。尽管研究了多种催化系统，但活性和选择性位点的本质尚不清楚。块体和支撑钒催化剂的不同催化性质通常与V物种的配位和环境的改变有关，这会影响其氧化还原性质。已经研究了单层系统(单分子分散，其中氧化物受载体最大影响)以优化活性位点的分散。从这些研究中可以得出结论，钒物种的性质和催化行为取决于载体金属氧化物。然而，尽管研究了各种催化系统，短链烷烃ODH的反应机制和选择性位点的本质仍在讨论中。本文的目的是总结在支撑钒氧化物催化剂上短链烷烃ODH中获得的催化结果，以及不同催化系统的结构和性质，以理解钒氧化物催化剂中活性和选择性位点的性质。
