[1] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."
[2] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."
[3] "Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia."
[4] "Values of the rate coefficients for eqs 911 were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UVvisible absorption band edge energy."
[5] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."
[6] "Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The selectivity and conversion of alkenes are affected by the catalyst's structure and composition. For instance, the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion is observed to decrease with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. Recent studies on metal oxide-supported vanadia have shed light on the relationship between catalyst structure and performance. The rate coefficients for the ODH process were found to be dependent on the vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UV-visible absorption band edge energy. Large vanadia domains are required for ODH, and propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, while propane combustion occurs on smaller domains. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the size and environment of the active sites, which can influence the selectivity towards desired products.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）影响的复杂过程。烯烃的选择性和转化率受到催化剂结构和组成的显著影响。例如，对于支撑金属氧化物，随着支撑物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性的下降被观察到减少。最近对金属氧化物支撑的钒氧化物的研究揭示了催化剂结构和性能之间的关系。ODH过程的速率系数被发现依赖于钒氧化物域的大小，这与UV-可见吸收带边能量相关。ODH需要大的钒氧化物域，而丙烯燃烧优先发生在大的多钒酸盐域上，而丙烷燃烧发生在较小的域上。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过控制活性位点的大小和环境，可以影响对所需产品的选择性。
