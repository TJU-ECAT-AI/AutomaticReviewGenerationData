The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Many oxide catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, exhibit high selectivity for alkenes at low alkane conversion levels, but this selectivity decreases as alkane conversion increases. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion is observed to decrease with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. Recent progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been made, particularly for metal oxide-supported vanadia. The rate coefficients for the ODH process have been determined and analyzed in relation to vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UV-visible absorption band edge energy. It has been found that the value of the rate coefficient for alkene formation increases with increasing domain size, while the ratio of the rate coefficients for alkene and alkane combustion decreases. This indicates that ODH requires large vanadia domains, with propene combustion occurring preferentially on large polyvanadate domains and propane combustion on smaller domains. Understanding these relationships is crucial for the development and modification of catalysts to improve process efficiency and selectivity.

氧化脱氢（ODH）是受多种催化剂和反应机制影响的复杂过程。许多氧化物催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在低烷烃转化水平下对烯烃表现出高选择性，但随着烷烃转化的增加，这种选择性会下降。对于支撑金属氧化物，观察到随着支撑物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化增加，烯烃选择性的下降会减少。最近在理解催化剂结构和性能之间的关系方面取得了进展，特别是在金属氧化物支撑的钒氧化物方面。已经确定了ODH过程的速率系数，并分析了与钒氧化物域大小的关系，这与UV-可见吸收带边能量相关。发现烷烃形成速率系数的值随着域大小的增加而增加，而烯烃和烷烃燃烧速率系数的比值随着域大小的增加而减少。这表明ODH需要大的钒氧化物域，其中丙烯燃烧在大的多钒酸盐域上优先发生，而丙烷燃烧在较小的域上优先发生。理解这些关系对于开发和改进催化剂以提高过程效率和选择性至关重要。
