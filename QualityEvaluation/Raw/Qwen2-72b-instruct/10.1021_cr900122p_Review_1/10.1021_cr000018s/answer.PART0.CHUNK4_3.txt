[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the activation of strong C-H bonds and the formation of alkene products. The selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are influenced by various factors, including the nature of the catalyst, reaction conditions, and the structure of the alkane substrate. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been widely studied for ODH reactions. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is crucial, as it can prevent the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions."

[2] "The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These mechanisms are influenced by the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst, which can affect the stability and reactivity of the intermediates. The efficiency of the ODH process is determined by the balance between the rates of C-H bond activation, alkene formation, and the formation of undesired products."

[3] "The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are related to the stability and reactivity of the intermediates, as well as the competition between the desired alkene formation and the formation of undesired products. The use of site-isolated catalysts can improve selectivity by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is crucial, as it can prevent the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions."
