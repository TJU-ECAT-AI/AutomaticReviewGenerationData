[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins is a challenging process due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the tendency for over-oxidation to COx products. Selectivity to olefins is often low due to the formation of undesired byproducts. Site isolation strategies, such as using single-site catalysts or supported metal nanoparticles, can improve selectivity by limiting the number of active sites available for secondary reactions. Proposed mechanisms for ODH include initial C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the ability to suppress over-oxidation. Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing secondary reactions that lead to over-oxidation and byproduct formation."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins is a complex process due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes and the propensity for over-oxidation to COx products. Selectivity to olefins is often compromised by the formation of unwanted byproducts. Site isolation strategies, such as using single-site catalysts or supported metal nanoparticles, can enhance selectivity by limiting the number of active sites available for secondary reactions. The proposed mechanisms for ODH include initial C-H bond activation, the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is affected by the type of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the ability to prevent over-oxidation. Site isolation is crucial in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing secondary reactions that lead to over-oxidation and the formation of byproducts.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）生成烯烃是一个复杂的过程，因为烷烃中C-H键的强度和向COx产物过度氧化的倾向。对烯烃的选择性通常由于形成不希望的副产品而受损。通过使用单点催化剂或负载金属纳米粒子的位点隔离策略，可以通过限制可用于二次反应的活性位点数量来提高选择性。提出的ODH机制包括初始C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽象。过程的效率受催化剂类型、反应条件和防止过度氧化能力的影响。位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用，通过最小化导致过度氧化和副产品形成的二次反应。
