[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins is an important industrial process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion is challenging due to the stability of C-H bonds in alkanes. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been studied for ODH. Proposed mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing secondary reactions."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to produce olefins is a significant industrial process. However, achieving both high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to the stability of C-H bonds in alkanes. Researchers have investigated bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts for ODH. The proposed mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing secondary reactions, thereby improving the overall process efficiency.
