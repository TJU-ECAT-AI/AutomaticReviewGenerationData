[1] "There are two major pathways for carbon formation: The tendency to form carbon on the catalyst surface depends on reaction kinetics, process conditions (temperature, pressure flow rates), and reformer design."
[2] "These carbon-forming reactions are delicately balanced by carbon-consuming reactions such as in eqs 3 and 4, which are also dependent upon reaction kinetics, process conditions, and reactor design."
[3] "In fact it has been proposed that the working commercial SMR-reduced Ni catalyst is coated with a working layer of carbon."
[4] "Commercial approaches to minimize potential carbon formation include high ratios of steam to hydrocarbon, the continual addition of ppm levels of sulfur compounds to the feed stream, the addition of alkali promoters, and added support phases such as MgAl spinel."
[5] "Catalysts can also fail because of Ni sintering or carbon deposition in cold spots within the reactor tubes."
[6] "In research on improvements to SMR, catalysts must be studied at high pressures [>10 atm] because pressure can impact carbon deposition profoundly."
[7] "A significant part of the catalyst loaded into tubular reformers is unused or poorly utilized because heat transfer is often the limiting factor."
[8] "The lifetime of the catalyst is an important criterion in evaluating new catalysts with respect to current commercial SMR technologies; claims of superior catalytic performance must be verified by operation at the high pressures and temperatures of conventional processes for extended periods, i.e., thousands of hours."
[9] "Of particular value would be a simple, accelerated aging test that allows assessment of catalyst life in hours or days rather than the usual period of months."
[10] "Research to discover a more efficient way to utilize the energy in SMR operations (e.g., heat exchange reformers) is needed to reduce costs and CO2 production."
[11] "Sintering of active Ni metal particles limits current catalyst performance; thus, a better understanding of the factors that impact this aspect of catalyst behavior would be highly desirable."
[12] "Since sulfur is present in many of the feedstocks, additional research efforts should address sulfur removal as well as the development of more sulfur-tolerant catalysts."
[13] "A further understanding of metal dust formation and corrosion of the reactor system is needed as well as an understanding of those factors that contribute to methane decomposition to elemental carbon."
[14] "Major improvements in the current technologies could be realized with new catalysts that optimize CO2 and/or H2O adsorption, enhance surface reactions, or inhibit the formation of elemental carbon."
[15] "Better methods for the transfer of heat into the reactor, including novel catalyst shapes, are needed to impact overall yield and process performance."
[16] "In addition, there is a need to develop nonconventional approaches to H2 generation."
[17] "However, the inherent energy-intensive nature of this approach makes its commercial viability questionable."
[18] "The advantage of this methodology is the possibility of coupling H2 synthesis with fuel-cell power generation, which requires H2 with CO levels typically below 20 ppm."
[19] "In any case, in all approaches to the generation of H2 from hydrocarbons, a very important issue is carbon formation and its transformation into an inactive form that leads to excessive carbon buildup."
[20] "There are a number of emerging and attractive approaches to H2 production."
[21] "However, the greatest opportunities with respect to CO2 production are those nonfossil fuel-based H2 technologies where major breakthroughs are needed."
[22] "In considering new technologies for H2 production, one must consider the integrated process, that is, the separation and purification steps, the net energy demands and balance, the quality of the feed, etc."
[23] "Ultimately, the route chosen to produce H2 will depend not only upon the technological advances, but also on the economics, the related environmental issues, and the market demands."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. The central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2. Many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity at very low alkane conversion levels, but all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. The relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity are not well understood. Knowledge of these relationships would be very useful for guiding the modification of existing catalysts and for the synthesis of totally new classes of catalysts. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of large polyvanadate domains, which are associated with propene combustion. Propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）为生产烯烃提供了一种潜在的有吸引力的方法。关键问题是如何在避免丙烷或丙烯燃烧至CO2的同时，实现丙烯的高产率。许多氧化物催化剂在非常低的烷烃转化水平下表现出高烯烃选择性，但随着烷烃转化率的增加，所有催化剂的烯烃选择性都会下降。对于负载金属氧化物，随着支持物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化率增加而下降的烯烃选择性降低。催化剂组成和结构与催化剂活性和选择性之间的关系尚未充分理解。了解这些关系对于指导现有催化剂的改进和全新催化剂类别的合成非常有用。位点隔离通过防止形成与丙烯燃烧相关的大型多钒酸盐域，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。丙烯燃烧优选在大型多钒酸盐域上发生，但丙烷燃烧优选在较小的域上发生。
