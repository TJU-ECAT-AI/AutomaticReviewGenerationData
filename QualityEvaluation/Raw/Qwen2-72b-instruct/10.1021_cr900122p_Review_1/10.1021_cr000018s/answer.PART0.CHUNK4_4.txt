[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the activation of strong C-H bonds and the formation of C=C double bonds. The selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are influenced by the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the mechanism of C-H bond activation. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been widely studied for ODH reactions. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues has also been explored."

[2] "The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are related to the stability of the catalyst, the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation, and the competition between the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH reactions include the formation of M-alkyl intermediates, the abstraction of 2H from the alkane, and the activation of the C-H bond by metal oxides."

[3] "The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the stability of the catalyst, the selectivity of the catalyst for the desired product, and the conversion of the alkane to the desired product. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is related to the prevention of side reactions and the promotion of the desired reaction pathway."
