[1] "There are two major pathways for carbon formation: The tendency to form carbon on the catalyst surface depends on reaction kinetics, process conditions (temperature, pressure flow rates), and reformer design."
[2] "These carbon-forming reactions are delicately balanced by carbon-consuming reactions such as in eqs 3 and 4, which are also dependent upon reaction kinetics, process conditions, and reactor design."
[3] "Issues of thermodynamics and heat transfer restrict operating temperatures. Membrane reactors have been considered as alternatives. However, these are not easily scaled-up and are currently unreliable."
[4] "Furthermore, they are too expensive to operate because H2 must be utilized in these reactors at elevated pressure and the cost of the required compression is prohibitive."
[5] "A significant part of the catalyst loaded into tubular reformers is unused or poorly utilized because heat transfer is often the limiting factor."
[6] "Engineering design advances are needed and are being pursued, such as heat exchange reformers or alteration of the catalyst geometry."
[7] "Operation of steam reformers for CO production is also limited by metal dusting arising from the production of CO and its reaction with the nickel alloys of the reactor tubes at 650 C."
[8] "Operating outside the regimes for metal dust formation offers advantages of safer operation, lower costs, and corrosion avoidance."
[9] "The use of ex-situ surface science methods to better understand the working catalysts is hampered by the extreme temperatures (850 C) and pressures (400 psig) needed for operation of current commercial catalysts."
[10] "The implementation of in-situ surface science techniques to monitor catalyst performance should be explored (see Section V)."
[11] "For example, ultraviolet Raman, 30 sum frequency generation, 31 and synchrotron-based methods such as X-ray scattering 32 could be applied toward these kinds of systems at extreme process conditions."
[12] "At the fundamental research level, there is a need for in-situ catalyst characterization at >20 atm, the actual process pressure."
[13] "In the United States, with the exception of several industrial laboratories, there are few facilities that have capabilities for studying and testing reforming catalysts under actual process conditions."
[14] "The lifetime of the catalyst is an important criterion in evaluating new catalysts with respect to current commercial SMR technologies; claims of superior catalytic performance must be verified by operation at the high pressures and temperatures of conventional processes for extended periods, i.e., thousands of hours."
[15] "Of particular value would be a simple, accelerated aging test that allows assessment of catalyst life in hours or days rather than the usual period of months."
[16] "Other promising research areas include understanding catalyst sintering, sulfur poisoning, and metal dust formation."
[17] "Only 50% of the fuel used to heat SMR reactors is actually used to make H2; the balance of the heat energy is recovered in steam, which is then sold to other customers but is not typically useful for making additional H2."
[18] "Research to discover a more efficient way to utilize the energy in SMR operations (e.g., heat exchange reformers) is needed to reduce costs and CO2 production."
[19] "Sintering of active Ni metal particles limits current catalyst performance; thus, a better understanding of the factors that impact this aspect of catalyst behavior would be highly desirable."
[20] "Since sulfur is present in many of the feedstocks, additional research efforts should address sulfur removal as well as the development of more sulfur-tolerant catalysts."
[21] "A further understanding of metal dust formation and corrosion of the reactor system is needed as well as an understanding of those factors that contribute to methane decomposition to elemental carbon."
[22] "Major improvements in the current technologies could be realized with new catalysts that optimize CO2 and/or H2O adsorption, enhance surface reactions, or inhibit the formation of elemental carbon."
[23] "Current reformers are heat-transfer-limited rather than catalyst-limited and are loaded with large excesses of catalyst because of the space velocities utilized."
[24] "Better methods for the transfer of heat into the reactor, including novel catalyst shapes, are needed to impact overall yield and process performance."
[25] "In addition, there is a need to develop nonconventional approaches to H2 generation."
[26] "Plasma decomposition of methane to carbon has been explored."
[27] "However, the inherent energy-intensive nature of this approach makes its commercial viability questionable."
[28] "Operating SMR in a cyclic mode, that is, separating the decomposition of methane to carbon and H2 from the water/carbon reaction has been demonstrated in the laboratory to generate CO-free hydrogen."
[29] "However, large-scale development and lifetime tests have not been carried out."
[30] "The advantage of this methodology is the possibility of coupling H2 synthesis with fuel-cell power generation, which requires H2 with CO levels typically below 20 ppm."
[31] "In any case, in all approaches to the generation of H2 from hydrocarbons, a very important issue is carbon formation and its transformation into an inactive form that leads to excessive carbon buildup."
[32] "There are a number of emerging and attractive approaches to H2 production."
[33] "However, the greatest opportunities with respect to CO2 production are those nonfossil fuel-based H2 technologies where major breakthroughs are needed."
[34] "In considering new technologies for H2 production, one must consider the integrated process, that is, the separation and purification steps, the net energy demands and balance, the quality of the feed, etc."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. The central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. The relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity are limited.

The implementation of in-situ surface science techniques to monitor catalyst performance should be explored. Issues of thermodynamics and heat transfer restrict operating temperatures.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）为生产烯烃提供了一种潜在的有吸引力的方法。主要问题是如何在避免丙烷或丙烯燃烧为CO2的同时，实现丙烯的高产率。对于负载金属氧化物，随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性的下降随着支撑物碱性的增加而减少。催化剂组成和结构与催化剂活性和选择性之间的关系有限。使用离位表面科学方法来更好地理解工作催化剂受到当前商业催化剂所需极端温度和压力的阻碍。应探索在位表面科学技术以监测催化剂性能。热力学和传热问题限制了操作温度。膜反应器已被考虑为替代方案，但它们不易放大且目前不可靠。它们的运行成本过高，因为在这些反应器中必须在升高的压力下使用H2，所需压缩的成本是禁止的。由于传热通常是限制因素，因此装入管式重整器的催化剂的很大一部分未使用或使用不当。需要工程设计进步，例如热交换重整器或催化剂几何形状的改变。由于CO的产生及其与650 C下反应器管的镍合金的反应，蒸汽重整器用于CO生产也受到金属粉尘的限制。在金属粉尘形成区域之外运行提供了更安全操作、更低成本和腐蚀避免的优势。催化剂的寿命是评估与当前商业SMR技术相关的新型催化剂的重要标准。特别有价值的是一个简单的加速老化测试，允许在几小时或几天内评估催化剂寿命，而不是通常的几个月时间。其他有希望的研究领域包括理解催化剂烧结、硫中毒和金属粉尘形成。需要研究以发现更有效利用SMR操作中能量的方法，以降低成本和CO2生产。活性Ni金属颗粒的烧结限制了当前催化剂的性能。由于许多进料中存在硫，因此额外的研究工作应解决硫去除以及开发更耐硫的催化剂。需要进一步了解金属粉尘形成和反应器系统的腐蚀，以及那些导致甲烷分解为元素碳的因素。通过优化CO2和/或H2O吸附、增强表面反应或抑制元素碳的形成，新型催化剂可以实现现有技术的重大改进。当前的重整器受到传热限制，而不是催化剂限制，并且由于使用了空间速度，因此装载了大量过量的催化剂。为了影响整体产率和过程性能，需要更好的方法将热量传递到反应器中，包括新型催化剂形状。在任何情况下，在从烃类生成H2的所有方法中，一个非常重要的问题是碳形成及其转化为导致碳过度积累的非活性形式。有几种新兴和有吸引力的H2生产方法。然而，就CO2生产而言，最大的机遇在于那些非化石燃料基H2技术，其中需要重大突破。在考虑H2生产的新技术时，必须考虑集成过程，即分离和纯化步骤、净能量需求和平衡、进料质量等。最终，选择生产H2的路线不仅取决于技术进步，还取决于经济、相关环境问题和市场需求。

The selectivity and conversion of alkenes are affected by the catalyst's structure and composition. For instance, the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion is observed to decrease with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. Recent studies on metal oxide-supported vanadia have shed light on the relationship between catalyst structure and performance. The rate coefficients for the ODH process were found to be dependent on the vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UV-visible absorption band edge energy. Large vanadia domains are required for ODH, and propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, while propane combustion occurs on smaller domains.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）影响的复杂过程。烯烃的选择性和转化率受到催化剂结构和组成的显著影响。例如，对于支撑金属氧化物，随着支撑物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性的下降被观察到减少。最近对金属氧化物支撑的钒氧化物的研究揭示了催化剂结构和性能之间的关系。ODH过程的速率系数被发现依赖于钒氧化物域的大小，这与UV-可见吸收带边能量相关。ODH需要大的钒氧化物域，而丙烯燃烧优先发生在大的多钒酸盐域上，而丙烷燃烧发生在较小的域上。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过控制活性位点的大小和环境，可以影响对所需产品的选择性。

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. The central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2. Many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity at very low alkane conversion levels, but all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. The relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity are not well understood. Knowledge of these relationships would be very useful for guiding the modification of existing catalysts and for the synthesis of totally new classes of catalysts. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of large polyvanadate domains, which are associated with propene combustion. Propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains.

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins is a challenging process due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the tendency for over-oxidation to COx products. Selectivity to olefins is often low due to the formation of undesired byproducts. Site isolation strategies, such as using single-site catalysts or supported metal nanoparticles, can improve selectivity by limiting the number of active sites available for secondary reactions. Proposed mechanisms for ODH include initial C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the ability to suppress over-oxidation. Site isolation plays a key role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing secondary reactions that lead to over-oxidation and byproduct formation."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Many oxide catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, exhibit high selectivity for alkenes at low alkane conversion levels, but this selectivity decreases as alkane conversion increases. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion is observed to decrease with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides. Recent progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been made, particularly for metal oxide-supported vanadia. The rate coefficients for the ODH process have been determined and analyzed in relation to vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UV-visible absorption band edge energy. It has been found that the value of the rate coefficient for alkene formation increases with increasing domain size, while the ratio of the rate coefficients for alkene and alkane combustion decreases. This indicates that ODH requires large vanadia domains, with propene combustion occurring preferentially on large polyvanadate domains and propane combustion on smaller domains. Understanding these relationships is crucial for the development and modification of catalysts to improve process efficiency and selectivity.

氧化脱氢（ODH）是受多种催化剂和反应机制影响的复杂过程。许多氧化物催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统，在低烷烃转化水平下对烯烃表现出高选择性，但随着烷烃转化的增加，这种选择性会下降。对于支撑金属氧化物，观察到随着支撑物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化增加，烯烃选择性的下降会减少。最近在理解催化剂结构和性能之间的关系方面取得了进展，特别是在金属氧化物支撑的钒氧化物方面。已经确定了ODH过程的速率系数，并分析了与钒氧化物域大小的关系，这与UV-可见吸收带边能量相关。发现烷烃形成速率系数的值随着域大小的增加而增加，而烯烃和烷烃燃烧速率系数的比值随着域大小的增加而减少。这表明ODH需要大的钒氧化物域，其中丙烯燃烧在大的多钒酸盐域上优先发生，而丙烷燃烧在较小的域上优先发生。理解这些关系对于开发和改进催化剂以提高过程效率和选择性至关重要。

However, in general, the efficiency of ODH processes is influenced by the type of catalyst used, with bulk metal oxides and supported systems having different properties that affect their performance. High selectivity and conversion can be challenging due to the competing reactions that can occur, such as over-oxidation or cracking of the alkane. Proposed mechanisms often involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which can be influenced by the catalyst's active sites and the reaction conditions. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing side reactions and promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway.

[1] "There are two major pathways for carbon formation: The tendency to form carbon on the catalyst surface depends on reaction kinetics, process conditions (temperature, pressure flow rates), and reformer design."
[2] "These carbon-forming reactions are delicately balanced by carbon-consuming reactions such as in eqs 3 and 4, which are also dependent upon reaction kinetics, process conditions, and reactor design."
[3] "In fact it has been proposed that the working commercial SMR-reduced Ni catalyst is coated with a working layer of carbon."
[4] "Commercial approaches to minimize potential carbon formation include high ratios of steam to hydrocarbon, the continual addition of ppm levels of sulfur compounds to the feed stream, the addition of alkali promoters, and added support phases such as MgAl spinel."
[5] "Issues of thermodynamics and heat transfer restrict operating temperatures. Membrane reactors have been considered as alternatives. However, these are not easily scaled-up and are currently unreliable."
[6] "Furthermore, they are too expensive to operate because H2 must be utilized in these reactors at elevated pressure and the cost of the required compression is prohibitive."
[7] "A significant part of the catalyst loaded into tubular reformers is unused or poorly utilized because heat transfer is often the limiting factor."
[8] "Engineering design advances are needed and are being pursued, such as heat exchange reformers or alteration of the catalyst geometry."
[9] "Operation of steam reformers for CO production is also limited by metal dusting arising from the production of CO and its reaction with the nickel alloys of the reactor tubes at 650 C."
[10] "The use of ex-situ surface science methods to better understand the working catalysts is hampered by the extreme temperatures (850 C) and pressures (400 psig) needed for operation of current commercial catalysts."
[11] "The lifetime of the catalyst is an important criterion in evaluating new catalysts with respect to current commercial SMR technologies; claims of superior catalytic performance must be verified by operation at the high pressures and temperatures of conventional processes for extended periods, i.e., thousands of hours."
[12] "Of particular value would be a simple, accelerated aging test that allows assessment of catalyst life in hours or days rather than the usual period of months."
[13] "Other promising research areas include understanding catalyst sintering, sulfur poisoning, and metal dust formation."
[14] "Since sulfur is present in many of the feedstocks, additional research efforts should address sulfur removal as well as the development of more sulfur-tolerant catalysts."
[15] "A further understanding of metal dust formation and corrosion of the reactor system is needed as well as an understanding of those factors that contribute to methane decomposition to elemental carbon."
[16] "Major improvements in the current technologies could be realized with new catalysts that optimize CO2 and/or H2O adsorption, enhance surface reactions, or inhibit the formation of elemental carbon."
[17] "Better methods for the transfer of heat into the reactor, including novel catalyst shapes, are needed to impact overall yield and process performance."
[18] "In addition, there is a need to develop nonconventional approaches to H2 generation."
[19] "Plasma decomposition of methane to carbon has been explored."
[20] "However, the inherent energy-intensive nature of this approach makes its commercial viability questionable."
[21] "Operating SMR in a cyclic mode, that is, separating the decomposition of methane to carbon and H2 from the water/carbon reaction has been demonstrated in the laboratory to generate CO-free hydrogen."
[22] "However, large-scale development and lifetime tests have not been carried out."
[23] "The advantage of this methodology is the possibility of coupling H2 synthesis with fuel-cell power generation, which requires H2 with CO levels typically below 20 ppm."
[24] "In any case, in all approaches to the generation of H2 from hydrocarbons, a very important issue is carbon formation and its transformation into an inactive form that leads to excessive carbon buildup."
[25] "There are a number of emerging and attractive approaches to H2 production."
[26] "However, the greatest opportunities with respect to CO2 production are those nonfossil fuel-based H2 technologies where major breakthroughs are needed."
[27] "In considering new technologies for H2 production, one must consider the integrated process, that is, the separation and purification steps, the net energy demands and balance, the quality of the feed, etc."
[28] "Ultimately, the route chosen to produce H2 will depend not only upon the technological advances, but also on the economics, the related environmental issues, and the market demands."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. The central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2. Many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity at very low alkane conversion levels, but all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. The decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support. Current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity. Knowledge of these relationships would be very useful for guiding the modification of existing catalysts and for the synthesis of totally new classes of catalysts. Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia. A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS. Values of the rate coefficients for the oxidative dehydrogenation processes were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UV-visible absorption band edge energy. While the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains. The interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by allowing for the control of the local environment around the active sites, which can affect the selectivity of the reaction.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）为烯烃的生产提供了一种潜在的有吸引力的方法。主要问题是如何在避免丙烷或丙烯燃烧至CO2的同时，实现丙烯的高产率。许多氧化物催化剂在非常低的烷烃转化水平下表现出高烯烃选择性，但所有催化剂在烷烃转化增加时，烯烃选择性都会下降。随着支持物碱性的增加，随着烷烃转化的增加，烯烃选择性的下降减少。目前，关于烯烃形成及其随后燃烧的基本过程的理解有限。特别是，关于催化剂组成和结构与催化剂活性和选择性之间的关系的理解不足。这些关系的知识对于指导现有催化剂的修改和全新催化剂的合成非常有用。最近，对于金属氧化物支持的钒酸盐，关于催化剂结构和性能之间的关系取得了一些进展。制备了一系列V2O5重量负载从1%到15%的催化剂，然后通过X射线吸收、拉曼光谱、紫外-可见吸收光谱和EXAFS进行表征。氧化脱氢过程的速率系数的值被确定，并作为与紫外-可见吸收带边能量相关的钒酸盐域大小的函数进行检查。虽然k1的值随着域大小的增加而增加，但k2/k1的比值减少，k3/k1的比值与域大小无关。这些结果表明，ODH需要大的钒酸盐域。丙烯燃烧也优先发生在大的多钒酸盐域上，但丙烷燃烧优先发生在较小的域上。各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化的挑战以及提出的反应机制共同影响过程效率。位点隔离通过允许控制活性位点周围的局部环境，从而影响反应的选择性，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
