[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process that involves the activation of strong C-H bonds and the formation of C=C double bonds. The selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are influenced by various factors, including the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the structure of the alkane substrate. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been widely studied for ODH reactions. The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues has also been explored. In bulk metal oxides, the active sites are often not well-defined, leading to a distribution of active sites with different reactivities. This can result in a lack of selectivity and low conversion. Supported metal oxide catalysts, on the other hand, allow for better control over the active site distribution and can lead to improved selectivity and conversion. The reaction mechanisms proposed for ODH reactions include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between these factors."

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，涉及强C-H键的活化和C=C双键的形成。ODH反应的选择性和转化率受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的性质、反应条件和烷烃底物的结构。广泛研究了用于ODH反应的块状金属氧化物和负载金属氧化物催化剂。还探讨了位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。在块状金属氧化物中，活性位点通常没有明确定义，导致具有不同反应性的活性位点的分布。这可能导致选择性差和转化率低。另一方面，负载金属氧化物催化剂允许更好地控制活性位点分布，从而提高选择性和转化率。提出的ODH反应机理包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象。这些因素之间的相互作用影响了ODH过程的效率。
