          The document discusses the oxidative coupling of methane, which involves similar concepts to ODH. The best catalysts for oxidative coupling provide 20% methane conversion with 80% combined ethane and ethylene selectivity in a single pass through the reactor. The mechanism involves the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface and free-radical chemistry in the gas phase. Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of surface-generated CH3 radicals in the gas phase. The yield of C2H4 and C2H6 is limited by secondary reactions of CH3 radicals with the surface and further oxidation of C2H4, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. Several of the better oxidative coupling catalysts have been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation (OXD) of ethane, and in each case, the catalyst has been shown to be effective for this reaction. The initial activation step for both CH4 and C2H6 is believed to be the same - the formation of alkyl radicals. The C2H5 radicals have been identified with the MIESR system. The dominant subsequent pathways for methyl and ethyl radicals, however, are different. In the presence of O2, reaction (11) prevails over coupling or the unimolecular loss of C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2. For CH3 radicals, there is no analogous route to the formation of a stable product. Consequently, the yields of C2H4 from the OXD reaction are more than twice as large as those from oxidative coupling of CH4. Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions, a C2H4 selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C2H6 conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%. Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C2H6 (422 kJ mol-1) is less than that in CH4 (439 kJ mol-1), the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C2H6.

          文档讨论了甲烷的氧化偶联，这涉及与ODH类似的概念。最好的氧化偶联催化剂在单次通过反应器时，可提供20%的甲烷转化率和80%的乙烷和乙烯组合选择性。该机制涉及甲烷在金属氧化物表面的活化和气相中的自由基化学。乙烷主要由气相中表面生成的CH3自由基的偶联产生。C2H4和C2H6的产率受到CH3自由基与表面的二次反应以及C2H4在催化剂表面和气相中的进一步氧化的限制。几个较好的氧化耦合催化剂已被用于乙烷的氧化脱氢(OXD)研究，在每种情况下，催化剂都被证明对这种反应有效。CH4和C2H6的初始活化步骤被认为是一样的 - 都是形成烷基自由基。C2H5自由基已被MIESR系统识别。然而，甲基和乙基自由基的主要后续途径是不同的。在O2的存在下，反应(11)优先于耦合或C2H5的单分子损失，C2H5 + O2 --> C2H4 + HO2。对于CH3自由基，没有类似的途径形成稳定的产物。因此，从OXD反应得到的C2H4的产量比从CH4氧化耦合得到的产量大两倍多。在含有氯离子的Li/MgO催化剂上，C2H4的选择性达到了77%，在C2H6转化率为75%时，这相当于58%的产量。此外，由于C2H6中的C-H键能(422 kJ mol-1)小于CH4中的C-H键能(439 kJ mol-1)，C2H6的反应速率大大高于CH4。
