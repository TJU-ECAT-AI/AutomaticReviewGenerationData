1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is crucial as it affects the reactivity and selectivity of the process. The specific features of each type of alkane also play a significant role, as they influence the choice of catalyst and the reaction mechanism. The type of supports, promoters, acid-base properties, and the type of oxygen used can all impact the performance of the ODH reaction. The determination of a molecular mechanism for ODH is challenging and requires advanced experimental and computational techniques. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a key role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the coordination number of the active center and the path of the ODH reaction. This can lead to the formation of different intermediates and products, affecting the overall selectivity and conversion of the process.
