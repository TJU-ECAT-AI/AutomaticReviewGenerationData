1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is crucial as it affects the reactivity and selectivity of the process. The specific features of each type of alkane also play a significant role, as they influence the choice of catalyst and the reaction mechanism. The type of supports, promoters, acid-base properties, and the type of oxygen used can all impact the performance of the ODH reaction. The determination of a molecular mechanism for ODH is challenging and requires advanced experimental and computational techniques. The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a key role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the coordination number of the active center and the path of the ODH reaction. This can lead to the formation of different intermediates and products, affecting the overall selectivity and conversion of the process.

[4] "There are various approaches of research to overcome these limitations. One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes most of the obstacles mentioned above."
[5] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."
[6] "The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane,n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups."
[7] "Catalysts based on alkali and alkaline earth ions and oxides."
[8] "Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides."
[9] "Other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P."
[10] "The nature of alkane influences not only reactivity, but also the choice of catalyst."
[11] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."
[12] "Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time)."
[13] "Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions."
[14] "It is well known that, unlike higher alkanes, ethane contains only the primary CH bonds (420 kJ), whereas ethene, the ODH product, contains only the vinylic CH bonds (445 kJ)."
[15] "The latter are strong and therefore the activation of ethane requires higher temperatures."
[16] "Because the energy of the vinylic CH bond is higher than that of the primary CH bond, selectivity to ethane is expected to increase with temperature."
[17] "Indeed, as shown in the lit- erature (9, 11, 12), selectivity to ethene is higher at higher temperatures, and it is peculiar that catalysts that do not contain easily reducible metal ions are more selective in ODHE."
[18] "Though the mechanisms of ODH reactions proposed by different authors differ from each other in some details and depend on the type of catalyst and alkane, some common features can be found."
[19] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps: 1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption). 2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species. 3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimin- ation) and formation of alkene. 4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."
[20] "The surface alkyl species can also form alkoxide (73, 74) species (a compet- ing pathway), which can be further oxidized to aldehydes and carboxylates and then to carbon oxides."
[21] "However, the detailed way in which alkenes interact with the catalyst surface depends on the type of catalyst and alkane."
[22] "For example, detailed mechanisms for the activation of butane and propane on isolated VO4, which are characteristic of Mg3V2O8, VOx/SiO2, VAPO-5, and other catalysts, are different (69)."
[23] "It has been shown that for vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both monomeric (77, 78) and polymeric (65, 79) units can be considered as active in ODH of lower alkanes and that the V(Mo)-O terminal bond is not involved in the oxidation reactions."
[24] "This supposition was confirmed by both the experimental rate of oxygen exchange in the oxygen labeled Me-18O and by the cluster model studies, performed by means of the ab initio DFT method to examine electronic properties of different surface O atoms in the V-O, V-O-P, and V-O-Mg systems and to correlate them with the catalytic performance."
[25] "It was also shown that the terminal bond considered earlier as active in selective oxidation had low activity (8082)."
[26] "The same method was also used to study catalytic properties such as reactivity of differently coordinated surface oxygen (82), effects of additives of vanadia- based catalysts for ODHP (83, 84), and energetics of the reoxidation process (85)."
[27] "Furthermore, it was shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which pro- ceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."
[28] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction."
[29] "For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."
[30] "The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations."
[31] "As has been shown (69), for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts."
[32] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the for- mation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."
[33] "As a result, the rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts."

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂(包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统)之间的复杂相互作用,以及实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。用于描述这种反应的机制和动力学模型至关重要。讨论了轻烷烃ODH的主要催化剂和每种类型烷烃的特定特征,以及支撑类型、促进剂、酸碱性质和氧气类型对ODH反应性能的影响。烷烃的性质不仅影响反应性,还影响催化剂的选择。基于可还原过渡金属氧化物的催化剂和其他催化剂(如B/P氧化物、Ga/沸石、LaF3/SmO和Sn/P)被使用。迄今为止研究的轻烷烃(如乙烷、丙烷、n-丁烷等)的ODH系统大致可以分为三类。在ODHE中表现最佳的催化系统在较高烷烃的ODH中往往表现不佳,反之亦然。影响催化系统选择性和活性的其他因素包括反应条件(进料混合物、温度和接触时间)。催化剂的选择必须与烷烃的类型和反应条件相关联。氯离子的主要作用是生成乙基自由基,这对于实现高乙烯产量(超过30%)至关重要。乙氧基离子可能分解为乙烯,或进一步氧化为CO和CO2。活性中心的配位数影响ODH反应的路径。烷烃解离所发生的活性中心的环境可能在几种构型之间变化。对于基于钒的催化剂,不同类型的钒物种可以与催化剂的不同行为相关联。桥接V-O-支撑氧离子的强度和可还原性起着重要作用,酸性和/或碱性中心的形成取决于支撑的性质,在掺杂催化剂的情况下,取决于添加剂的碱性。结果,烯烃中间体的形成速率和烯烃的解吸似乎取决于催化剂的酸碱性质。通过控制活性中心的配位数和活性中心的环境,位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts and the specific features of each type of alkane. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, and the choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane. The reaction mechanisms for ODH involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the coordination number of the active center, which affects the path of the ODH reaction. The use of advanced experimental and computational techniques is necessary to determine the molecular mechanism of ODH. The performance of ODH reaction is influenced by the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, and type of oxygen. The reaction conditions, such as feed mixture, temperature, and contact time, also affect the selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems. Catalyst selection must be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions.

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.
