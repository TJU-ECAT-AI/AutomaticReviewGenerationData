          [1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed. Influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed."
          [2] "The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions."
          [3] "The determination of a molecular mechanism is a difficult task and requires use of advanced experimental and computational techniques."
          [4] "The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
          [5] "The nature of alkane influences not only reactivity, but also the choice of catalyst."
          [6] "Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides."
          [7] "Other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P."
          [8] "The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups."
          [9] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."
          [10] "Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time)."
          [11] "Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions."
          [12] "The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%)."
          [13] "The ethoxide ions may either decompose to ethene or be further oxidized to CO and CO2."
          [14] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction."
          [15] "The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations."
          [16] "As has been shown, for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts."
          [17] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."
          [18] "As a result, the rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane, with different catalysts being more effective for different alkanes. The reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the process. Site isolation can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products. The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the catalyst type, reaction conditions, and the specific features of each alkane. Acid-base properties, type of oxygen, and the presence of promoters can also impact the performance of the ODH reaction.

          烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。催化剂的选择受烷烃性质的影响，不同的催化剂对不同的烷烃更有效。反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提，在决定过程的选择性和转化率方面起着关键作用。位点隔离可以通过防止不希望的产品的形成来帮助解决选择性问题。ODH过程的效率受到催化剂类型、反应条件和每种烷烃的特定特征的共同影响。酸碱性质、氧气类型和促进剂的存在也会影响ODH反应的性能。
