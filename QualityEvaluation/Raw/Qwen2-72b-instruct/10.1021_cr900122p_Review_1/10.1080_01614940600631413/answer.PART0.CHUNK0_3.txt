[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed. Influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed."
[2] "The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions."
[3] "The determination of a molecular mechanism is a difficult task and requires use of advanced experimental and computational techniques."
[4] "The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
[5] "The nature of alkane influences not only reactivity, but also the choice of catalyst."
[6] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."
[7] "Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time)."
[8] "Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions."
[9] "The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%)."
[10] "The ethoxide ions may either decompose to ethene or be further oxidized to CO and CO2."
[11] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction."
[12] "For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides."
[13] "The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations."
[14] "As has been shown, for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts."
[15] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."
[16] "As a result, the rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts and the specific features of each type of alkane. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, and the choice of catalyst is influenced by the nature of the alkane. The reaction mechanisms for ODH involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the coordination number of the active center, which affects the path of the ODH reaction. The use of advanced experimental and computational techniques is necessary to determine the molecular mechanism of ODH. The performance of ODH reaction is influenced by the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, and type of oxygen. The reaction conditions, such as feed mixture, temperature, and contact time, also affect the selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems. Catalyst selection must be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions.
