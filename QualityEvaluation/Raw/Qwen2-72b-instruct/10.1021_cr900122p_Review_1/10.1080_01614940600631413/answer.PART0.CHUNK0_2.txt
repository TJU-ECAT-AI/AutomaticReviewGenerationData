1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves complex interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, and the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The mechanisms and kinetic models used for the description of this reaction are crucial. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed, as well as the influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid-base properties, and type of oxygen on the performance of the ODH reaction. The nature of the alkane influences not only reactivity but also the choice of catalyst. Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides and other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P are used. The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, n-butane, etc., can be classified into three groups. The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa. Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time). Catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions. The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, critical for achieving a high ethene yield. The ethoxide ions may decompose to ethene or be further oxidized to CO and CO2. The coordination number of the active center affects the path of the ODH reaction. The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations. For vanadium-based catalysts, different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts. Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive. The rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the coordination number of the active center and the environment of the active center.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂(包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统)之间的复杂相互作用,以及实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。用于描述这种反应的机制和动力学模型至关重要。讨论了轻烷烃ODH的主要催化剂和每种类型烷烃的特定特征,以及支撑类型、促进剂、酸碱性质和氧气类型对ODH反应性能的影响。烷烃的性质不仅影响反应性,还影响催化剂的选择。基于可还原过渡金属氧化物的催化剂和其他催化剂(如B/P氧化物、Ga/沸石、LaF3/SmO和Sn/P)被使用。迄今为止研究的轻烷烃(如乙烷、丙烷、n-丁烷等)的ODH系统大致可以分为三类。在ODHE中表现最佳的催化系统在较高烷烃的ODH中往往表现不佳,反之亦然。影响催化系统选择性和活性的其他因素包括反应条件(进料混合物、温度和接触时间)。催化剂的选择必须与烷烃的类型和反应条件相关联。氯离子的主要作用是生成乙基自由基,这对于实现高乙烯产量(超过30%)至关重要。乙氧基离子可能分解为乙烯,或进一步氧化为CO和CO2。活性中心的配位数影响ODH反应的路径。烷烃解离所发生的活性中心的环境可能在几种构型之间变化。对于基于钒的催化剂,不同类型的钒物种可以与催化剂的不同行为相关联。桥接V-O-支撑氧离子的强度和可还原性起着重要作用,酸性和/或碱性中心的形成取决于支撑的性质,在掺杂催化剂的情况下,取决于添加剂的碱性。结果,烯烃中间体的形成速率和烯烃的解吸似乎取决于催化剂的酸碱性质。通过控制活性中心的配位数和活性中心的环境,位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
