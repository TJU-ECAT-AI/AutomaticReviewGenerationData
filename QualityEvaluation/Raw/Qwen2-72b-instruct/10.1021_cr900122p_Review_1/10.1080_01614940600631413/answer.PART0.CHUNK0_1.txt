[1] "The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the specific features of each type of alkane are discussed. Influence of the type of supports, promoters, acid base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed."
[2] "The determination of a molecular mechanism is a difficult task and requires use of advanced experimental and computational techniques."
[3] "The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
[4] "There are various approaches of research to overcome these limitations. One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes most of the obstacles mentioned above."
[5] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."
[6] "The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane,n-butane, etc., can be approximately classified into three groups."
[7] "Catalysts based on alkali and alkaline earth ions and oxides."
[8] "Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides."
[9] "Other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P."
[10] "The nature of alkane influences not only reactivity, but also the choice of catalyst."
[11] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."
[12] "Other factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time)."
[13] "Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the reaction conditions."
[14] "It is well known that, unlike higher alkanes, ethane contains only the primary CH bonds (420 kJ), whereas ethene, the ODH product, contains only the vinylic CH bonds (445 kJ)."
[15] "The latter are strong and therefore the activation of ethane requires higher temperatures."
[16] "Because the energy of the vinylic CH bond is higher than that of the primary CH bond, selectivity to ethane is expected to increase with temperature."
[17] "Indeed, as shown in the lit- erature (9, 11, 12), selectivity to ethene is higher at higher temperatures, and it is peculiar that catalysts that do not contain easily reducible metal ions are more selective in ODHE."
[18] "Though the mechanisms of ODH reactions proposed by different authors differ from each other in some details and depend on the type of catalyst and alkane, some common features can be found."
[19] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps: 1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption). 2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species. 3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimin- ation) and formation of alkene. 4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."
[20] "The surface alkyl species can also form alkoxide (73, 74) species (a compet- ing pathway), which can be further oxidized to aldehydes and carboxylates and then to carbon oxides."
[21] "However, the detailed way in which alkenes interact with the catalyst surface depends on the type of catalyst and alkane."
[22] "For example, detailed mechanisms for the activation of butane and propane on isolated VO4, which are characteristic of Mg3V2O8, VOx/SiO2, VAPO-5, and other catalysts, are different (69)."
[23] "It has been shown that for vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both monomeric (77, 78) and polymeric (65, 79) units can be considered as active in ODH of lower alkanes and that the V(Mo)-O terminal bond is not involved in the oxidation reactions."
[24] "This supposition was confirmed by both the experimental rate of oxygen exchange in the oxygen labeled Me-18O and by the cluster model studies, performed by means of the ab initio DFT method to examine electronic properties of different surface O atoms in the V-O, V-O-P, and V-O-Mg systems and to correlate them with the catalytic performance."
[25] "It was also shown that the terminal bond considered earlier as active in selective oxidation had low activity (8082)."
[26] "The same method was also used to study catalytic properties such as reactivity of differently coordinated surface oxygen (82), effects of additives of vanadia- based catalysts for ODHP (83, 84), and energetics of the reoxidation process (85)."
[27] "Furthermore, it was shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which pro- ceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."
[28] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction."
[29] "For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."
[30] "The environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane proceeds may vary between several configurations."
[31] "As has been shown (69), for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts."
[32] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the for- mation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."
[33] "As a result, the rate of formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts."
