1.The literature does not provide specific information on the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, identifying the elementary steps and their reversibility. Propene is the primary product, and CO and CO2 form via secondary combustion of propene or direct combustion of propane. The study confirms that steps involving CH bond activation are irreversible, and normal kinetic isotopic effects were measured for propane dehydrogenation, propane combustion, and propene combustion. The results suggest that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactants. The proposed reaction mechanism is consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bonds in propane. The reduced Mo centers reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The recombination of OH groups to form water is reversible.

1.文献没有提供关于各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用的具体信息。但是,它确实讨论了ZrO2支持的MoOx催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢,确定了基本步骤及其可逆性。丙烯是主要产品,CO和CO2通过丙烯的二次燃烧或丙烷的直接燃烧形成。研究证实,涉及CH键活化的步骤是不可逆的,并测量了丙烷脱氢、丙烷燃烧和丙烯燃烧的正常动力学同位素效应。结果表明,丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的动力学相关步骤涉及各自反应物中CH键的解离。提出的反应机制与Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制一致,其中两个晶格氧参与丙烷中CH键的不可逆活化。还原的Mo中心通过O2的不可逆解离化学吸附重新氧化。OH基团重组形成水是可逆的。
