[1] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."
[2] "Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water."
[3] "In general, the redox behavior is support type- and composition-dependent and supported Cr ions are easier to reduce on chemically softer supports."
[4] "The oxide support acts as a ligand that controls the redox properties of the supported Cr ions."
[5] "Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees, depending on the support type and composition."
[6] "The chemistry of Cr at the surface is determined by the isoelectric point, the surface area of the support, and the Cr loading."
[7] "A tendency toward the formation of polychromates is observed for higher loadings and lower surface areas."
[8] "After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface by reactions with the hydroxyl groups and their molecular structure is determined by the composition and type of the support, the Cr loading, and the treatment."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by factors such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar, and supported Cr ions are highly reactive toward various molecules. The redox behavior is support type- and composition-dependent, and Cr ions are easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ are present, each under different coordination and polymerization degrees. The isoelectric point, surface area of the support, and Cr loading determine the surface chemistry of Cr. Higher loadings and lower surface areas tend to form polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface by reactions with the hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the composition and type of the support, the Cr loading, and the treatment. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency of ODH.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战受C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象等因素的影响。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过控制支撑Cr离子的氧化还原性质。Cr在无定形表面或分子筛表面上的化学性质非常相似，支撑的Cr离子对各种分子具有高反应性。氧化还原行为依赖于支撑类型和组成，Cr离子在化学较软的支撑上更容易还原。在还原条件下，Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+存在，每种在不同的配位和聚合度下。表面化学的Cr由等电点、支撑的表面积和Cr负载决定。高负载和低表面积倾向于形成多铬酸盐。煅烧后，铬氧化物通过与羟基的反应锚定在表面上，其分子结构由支撑的组成和类型、Cr负载和处理决定。这些因素共同影响ODH的工艺效率。
