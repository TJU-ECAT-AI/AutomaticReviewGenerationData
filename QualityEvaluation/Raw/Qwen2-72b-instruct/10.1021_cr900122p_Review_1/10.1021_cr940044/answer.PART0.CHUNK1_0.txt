1.The surface chemistry of chromium on amorphous surfaces and molecular sieves is quite similar. Chromium ions supported on inorganic oxides are mobile and highly reactive towards various molecules such as alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported chromium ions is dependent on the type and composition of the support, with easier reduction observed on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported chromium ions. Advanced mathematical and experimental tools provide a detailed quantitative picture at the molecular level. In situ spectroscopic investigations of chromium supported systems are the logical next step for developing useful structure-activity relationships in the field of environmental control and heterogeneous catalysis.

1.铬在无定形表面和分子筛表面上的表面化学非常相似。在无机氧化物上支持的铬离子是可移动的，并且对各种分子如醇，乙烯，一氧化碳和水具有高度反应性。支持的铬离子的氧化还原行为取决于支持物的类型和组成，在化学较软的支持物上观察到更容易的还原。氧化物支持物充当配体，控制支持的铬离子的氧化还原性质。先进的数学和实验工具在分子水平上提供了详细的定量图景。因此，对铬支持系统进行原位光谱学研究是环境控制和异相催化领域开发有用的结构-活性关系的合乎逻辑的下一步。
