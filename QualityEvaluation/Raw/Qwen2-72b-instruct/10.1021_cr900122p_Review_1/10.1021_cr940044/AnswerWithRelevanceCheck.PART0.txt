          The surface chemistry of supported chromium (Cr) on amorphous surfaces or molecular sieves is quite similar. Supported Cr ions are highly reactive and mobile, interacting with various molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of supported Cr ions is influenced by the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees depending on the support type and composition. Higher Cr loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support composition, Cr loading, and treatment conditions.

          在无定形表面或分子筛表面上，支撑铬（Cr）的表面化学非常相似。支撑的Cr离子具有高反应性和流动性，与各种分子如醇、乙烯、一氧化碳和水相互作用。支撑的Cr离子的氧化还原行为受支撑类型和组成的控制，在化学上较软的支撑上，Cr离子更容易被还原。氧化物支撑作为配体，控制着支撑的Cr离子的氧化还原性质。在还原条件下，Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+可能同时存在，它们的配位和聚合程度取决于支撑类型和组成。较高的Cr负载和较低的表面积倾向于形成多铬酸盐。经过煅烧后，铬氧化物通过与羟基的反应锚定在表面上，其分子结构由支撑组成、Cr负载和处理条件决定。
