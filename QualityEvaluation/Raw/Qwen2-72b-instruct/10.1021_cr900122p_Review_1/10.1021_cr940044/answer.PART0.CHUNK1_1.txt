1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various factors, including the type of catalyst used. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems both play a role in this process. The mobility and reactivity of supported Cr ions towards molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water are significant. The redox behavior of these ions is dependent on the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. Under reducing conditions, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+ can be present, with their coordination and polymerization degrees varying depending on the support type and composition. Higher loadings and lower surface areas tend to favor the formation of polychromates. After calcination, chromium oxides are anchored onto the surface through reactions with hydroxyl groups, and their molecular structure is determined by the support's composition, type, Cr loading, and treatment. The redox behavior is again influenced by the support type and composition. The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the interaction between the reactants and the catalyst surface, which can improve the efficiency of the ODH process.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)受多种因素影响,包括所用催化剂的类型。块体金属氧化物和支撑系统都在这一过程中发挥作用。支撑Cr离子对醇、乙烯、一氧化碳和水等分子的流动性和反应性是重要的。这些离子的氧化还原行为取决于支撑的类型和组成,在化学上较软的支撑上,Cr离子更容易被还原。支撑作为配体,控制着支撑Cr离子的氧化还原性质。在还原条件下,Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+可能同时存在,它们的配位和聚合程度根据支撑类型和组成而变化。高负载和低表面积倾向于形成多铬酸盐。经过煅烧后,铬氧化物通过与羟基的反应锚定在表面,其分子结构由支撑的组成、类型、Cr负载和处理决定。氧化还原行为再次受到支撑类型和组成的影响。Cr在无定形表面或分子筛表面上的化学性质相当相似。通过控制反应物与催化剂表面的相互作用,位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥着关键作用,这可以提高ODH过程的效率。
