[1] "Supported Cr ions are mobile and possess a high reactivity toward various molecules, like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. In general, the redox behavior is support type- and composition-dependent and supported Cr ions are easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. Thus, the oxide support acts as a ligand that controls the redox properties of the supported Cr ions."
[2] "The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar."
[3] "In conclusion, chromium ions supported on inorganic oxides are complex systems and their characterization requires a battery of complementary techniques. A detailed quantitative picture at the molecular level is obtained by using advanced mathematical and experimental tools. It is also clear that ultimately, spectroscopic techniques have to be developed which allow measurements in conditions as closely as possible to real conditions of e.g. a catalytic experiment. Thus, extension to in situ spectroscopic investigations of Cr supported systems is the logical next step, which will allow the development of useful structureactivity relationships for predictions in the field of environmental control and heterogeneous catalysis."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The supported Cr ions are mobile and highly reactive towards molecules like alcohols, ethylene, carbon monoxide, and water. The redox behavior of these ions is dependent on the type and composition of the support, with Cr ions being easier to reduce on chemically softer supports. The oxide support acts as a ligand, controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions. The chemistry of Cr on amorphous surfaces or on the surfaces of molecular sieves is quite similar. Characterizing these complex systems requires a combination of advanced mathematical and experimental techniques. Developing in situ spectroscopic investigations of Cr supported systems is the logical next step to understand the structure-activity relationships in the field of environmental control and heterogeneous catalysis. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the redox properties of the supported Cr ions.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。支撑的Cr离子是可移动的，并对诸如醇、乙烯、一氧化碳和水等分子具有高反应性。这些离子的氧化还原行为取决于支撑的类型和组成，在化学较软的支撑上，Cr离子更容易被还原。氧化支撑作为配体，控制着支撑Cr离子的氧化还原性质。Cr在无定形表面或分子筛表面上的化学性质相当相似。表征这些复杂系统需要结合先进的数学和实验技术。开发Cr支撑系统的原位光谱研究是理解环境控制和异相催化领域结构-活性关系的合乎逻辑的下一步。通过控制支撑Cr离子的氧化还原性质，位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
