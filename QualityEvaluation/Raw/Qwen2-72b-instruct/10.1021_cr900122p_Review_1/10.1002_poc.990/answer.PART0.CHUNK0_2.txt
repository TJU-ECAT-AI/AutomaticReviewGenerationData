1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), including the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, and the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex represents only a shallow minimum on the potential energy surface and -hydrogen transfer to complete the catalytic cycle must therefore take place in the extension of the CH activation step. The combination of a significant activation energy and a small pre-exponential factor in the rate constant makes CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的全面分析，包括各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机理以及位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。但是，它确实讨论了通过Cr(III)硅表面位点的氧化加成机制作为催化脱氢的可能途径。该机制涉及铬的正式双重氧化，并在Cr(III)的四重自旋势能面和Cr(V)的双重自旋势能面之间的接缝上定位了最小能量交叉点(MECP)。乙基氢化铬(V)复合物在势能面上仅表示一个浅的最小值，因此，为了完成催化循环，-氢转移必须在CH活化步骤的延伸中进行。显著的活化能和速率常数中小的前指数因子的结合使得通过氧化加成的CH活化在该系统中成为不太可能的脱氢机制。
