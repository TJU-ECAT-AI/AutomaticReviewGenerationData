Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) discussing the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. However, it does focus on the study of CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over mononuclear Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) was located on the seam between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex represents only a shallow minimum on the potential energy surface and -hydrogen transfer to complete the catalytic cycle must therefore take place in the extension of the CH activation step. The combination of a significant activation energy and a small pre-exponential factor in the rate constant makes CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system.

1.文献没有全面分析各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战以及提出的反应机制(如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象)对氧化脱氢烷烃(ODH)的影响。但是,它确实专注于研究Cr(III)硅表面单核位点上通过氧化加成在乙烷中进行CH活化作为催化脱氢的可能途径。该机制涉及铬的正式双重氧化,并在Cr(III)的四重自旋势能面和Cr(V)的双重自旋势能面之间的接缝上定位了最低能量交叉点(MECP)。乙基氢化铬(V)复合物在势能面上仅表示浅最小值,因此必须在CH活化步骤的扩展中进行-hydrogen转移以完成催化循环。活化能显著和速率常数中指数前因子小的组合使得通过氧化加成进行CH活化不太可能成为该系统中脱氢的机制。

However, it does discuss the mechanism of CH activation by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation over Cr(III)silica surface sites. The mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III) and the doublet spin potential energy surface of Cr(V). The ethylhydridochromium(V) complex formed is unstable with respect to the back-reaction, and -hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step to complete the catalytic cycle. The computed activation energy for this mechanism is high, around 220 kJ mol-1, making CH activation by oxidative addition an unlikely mechanism for dehydrogenation in this system. Site isolation is not explicitly discussed, but the literature does compare the reactivity of different Cr(III)silica surface sites, including those with two and three oxygen bridges to the silica surface.
