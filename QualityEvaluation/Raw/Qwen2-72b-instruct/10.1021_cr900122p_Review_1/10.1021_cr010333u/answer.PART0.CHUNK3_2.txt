[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important reaction for the production of olefins and aromatics. The reaction is challenging due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the need for high selectivity to the desired products. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been widely studied for this reaction. The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation of the active metal centers can improve selectivity by preventing secondary reactions. However, achieving high conversion and selectivity simultaneously remains a challenge."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a critical process for producing olefins and aromatics. It is a complex reaction due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes and the requirement for high selectivity to target products. Both bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been extensively researched for this purpose. The reaction mechanism generally includes C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation of active metal centers can enhance selectivity by avoiding secondary reactions. However, achieving both high conversion and selectivity concurrently is still a significant challenge.
