A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.
Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.
Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process.
Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator.
Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction.
Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.
When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching.
Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.
A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons.
The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the λmax of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase.
By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity.
The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical.
This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide.
In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized.
A heterogeneous cobalt catalyst based on an immobilized trimeric cobalt complex on MCM-41 has been claimed for the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in an aerobic system using the substrate as solvent.
Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels.
A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant.
In general it can be said that the most important limitations for the use of liquid-phase olefin epoxidation using solid catalysts are the low rates and low turnover frequencies, together with the too low selectivity to the desired epoxide owing to the presence of less desired free radical chain reactions.
A recent work has showed that Co and MnAlPO-18 is a regioselective oxidation catalyst for n-alkanes.
Because of the end-on approach of the n-paraffin in ALPO-18, owing to the pore dimensions and topology of this molecular sieve, only the C1 and C2 positions are preferentially oxidized.
When other structures with larger pore dimensions (AlPO-36 and AlPO-5) are used, oxyfunctionalization is predominant at the C3 and C4 positions.

In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. Thus, the active sites require a spatial organization at atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.31
The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).64
For instance, for the catalytic behavior of δ-alumina-supported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, it has been observed that the activity for dehydrogenation increases as the vanadium loading, while the selectivity toward alkene formation reaches a maximum at 34 wt %. 66 Apparently, the highest propene yields require of a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.66
The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation. Thus, studies of the structure and reactivity of group V metal oxides have been carried out by means of methanol adsorption and oxidation. 69 It has been found that the active sites present in pure V2O5 are primarily redox sites and the active sites in pure Nb2O5 are essentially acidic in nature. Furthermore, the surface redox sites present in pure V2O5 are orders of magnitude more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5 and consequently the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.69 However, niobia presence enhances significantly the activity of vanadia for those catalytic reactions that require a dual nature of redox and acid sites. This is the case of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
The relative low activity toward alkane oxydehydrogenation as compared to other vanadia-supported selective oxidation catalysts such as V2O5/TiO2 and (VO)2P2O7 has been attributed to the basic environment generated by the MgO support, which causes a parallel decrease of the Lewis acidity influencing the oxidizing power of the active V ions. 70
The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases. 71
Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. 72 The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.72
Lateral chain oxidation of alkylaromatics is an industrial process of paramount importance that can be also catalyzed by vanadium oxides. 73 Acidity also seems to play a role in this process, facilitating the oxidation. V2O7/TiO2 doped with K, Ba, Bi, W, and Sn oxides or carbonates exhibits catalytic activity in the oxidation of ortho-xylene to phthalic anhydride. At reaction temperatures higher than 370 C, good correlation between the strength of the acid sites and phthalic anhydride yield (K < Ba < Bi < unpromoted < W  Sn) was observed. 74
The results have been correlated again with the operation of the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism.
The active oxidation states of supported metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ag, and Au can be discussed by IR spectroscopy, UVVis spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and electron microscopy. Comparison of the catalytic and the spectroscopic data reveals that metal cations are the active sites of the metal catalyst surface in alcohol oxidation. 84
The activity and stability of solid catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming depend on the formation of carbon deposits due to methane decomposition into C and H2. 89 This carbon deposited on a metal site can be reoxidized to CO by oxygen coming from the dissociation of adsorbed CO2. For noble metals, this oxidation of deposited carbon is fast, leading to low carbon accumulation on the metal particles.89 What is remarkable is that the rate of carbon formation from methane was proportional to the concentration of Lewis acids. Thus, the combination of Pt with a support with a low Lewis acidity such as ZrO2 was found more suitable for long stability of the catalysts.
Partial oxidation of propane to syngas has been carried out in a flow reactor using as catalyst nickel oxide supported on alumina, magnesia, and silica. 92 Alumina-supported NiO was found the most suitable catalyst. Modification of these catalysts by alkali metal oxides or rare-earth oxide reduces the strength of the Lewis acid sites, and by decreasing the carbon deposition increases the stability and lifetime of the catalyst during propane partial oxidation.92
The applicability of surface science techniques to obtain insights on the mechanism of heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by metal oxides has been exemplified in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene catalyzed by iron oxide. 95 The information provided by surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum has been combined with batch reactor measurements at high pressure.95 Ethylbenzene and styrene adsorb on regular terrace sites with their phenyl rings oriented parallel to the surface. The π electron cloud of the aromatic rings interact with the Lewis acidic atoms on the surface. Atomic defects are identified as catalytically active sites. A complete mechanistic description of the process at the atomic level is proposed in which the upward tilted ethyl group of flat adsorbed ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated at Brnsted basic oxygens located at defects.
The conversion of methane into methyl formate with high molar yields (>12%) has been attained by a two reactor system. In the first one, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is accomplished at 600700 C on SiO2. Subsequently, formaldehyde is dimerized to methyl formate through a Cannizzaro disproportionation at 130170 C on various metal oxides, including titania, silica, zirconia, and sulfated zirconia. 96
Formaldehyde selectivity was found to depend on the percentage of iron on the support, the nature of the support, and the reaction temperature. Compared to silica, molybdenum oxide as support favors the formation of formaldehyde. This higher selectivity is related to the formation of iron molybdate as the active catalytic phase. FT-IR data indicate that the first step in all reaction processes is the generation of adsorbed iron-methoxy species.97
Molybdena supported on titania prepared from aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and titania or by mechanical mixing of both oxides is also very active for the partial oxidation of methanol. 98
From the catalytic tests in fixed-bed flow reactors, it has been found that the activity toward C2 products increases with catalyst basicity, while an increase in the Lewis acidity of the Bi cation leads to an enhancement of the ethene selectivity.99
As mentioned for the case of supported vanadium oxides as catalysts for liquid-phase reactions, the possibility of metal leaching and subsequent homogeneous phase catalysis by the leached metal should be addressed in this type of catalyst.
Likewise, heterogeneization of cobalt atoms by simple coprecipitation in the formation of silica gels using Co(OAc)2 has been reported to be effective for the side chain oxidation of alkylaromatic using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. Diffuse reflectance UVVis and IR spectra of the solid seem to support the presence of tetrahedral Co(II) (detached from acetate anions) in the silica framework. 101
Ozone and several of its 18O-labeled isotopomers have been adsorbed on metal oxides such as silica, titania, zirconia, magnesia, and ceria at liquid N2 temperature. 102 Ozone behaves as a weak basic molecule and interacts with surface hydroxyl groups. With weak Lewis acid sites, ozone molecules form coordination adducts via a terminal oxygen atom, with stronger Lewis acid sites (such as titania, alumina, and zinc oxide) no evidence of a Lewis adduct is obtained. Apparently, ozone dissociates on these sites generating highly reactive oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can participate in the catalytic oxidation of CO on oxide surfaces. 103
An IR study of adsorbed CO, NH3, C3H6, C3D6, and C3H6-O2 on oxidized and reduced samples of mixed titaniumantimony oxide showed that both oxidized and reduced solids contain basic sites, but lack of strong Lewis acid centers. 104 Interaction of propene occurs through the CH bond of the methyl group with the basic sites.104
Several solids have been developed for the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions exhibiting the typical advantages with respect to homogeneous catalysts, like easy handling and workup and recycling. A review discussing the use of amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites, particularly Beta and silicalite as catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction has recently appeared. 106 Amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites that exhibit surface basicity or Lewis acidity are generally the solids used as catalysts for this type of disproportionation.
A natural bentonite pillared with aluminum, aluminumiron, and aluminumruthenium polyoxocations has been further ion exchanged with iron. 112 All these solids were active materials for the catalytic transformation of propene into acetone at temperatures between 150 and 350 C.112 The reaction proceed via acid-catalyzed propene hydration followed by dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone. Accordingly, the activity of the solids correlates with the nature and population of the redox and acid sites.112
K10-montmorillonite and 4A molecular sieves catalyze the oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in good yield and selectivity, except when an electron-donating group is present in the 4-position of the phenyl ring. 113 The reaction mechanism was assumed to involve an Oppenauer-type oxidation. Using zeolite 13X as catalyst, a very enhanced activity was observed and interpreted as reflecting the fact that the reactants can be accommodated inside the zeolite cavities. However, besides the fast formation of carbonylic compounds, other competitive side reactions take place lowering the resulting selectivity.113

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. The C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are key steps in the ODH process.

Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions also depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The Lewis acidity of the cations influences the adsorption enthalpies, with the acidity increasing in the order V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion.
3.For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a critical parameter affecting the catalytic activity. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, changing the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties. The highest propene yields are achieved with a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.
4.The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be enhanced by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as seen in alkane oxidation. In pure V2O5, the active sites are primarily redox sites, while in pure Nb2O5, the active sites are essentially acidic in nature. The surface redox sites in pure V2O5 are more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5, and the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component. However, the presence of niobia enhances the activity of vanadia for reactions requiring a dual nature of redox and acid sites, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
5.The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on various oxides for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein increases as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species on the solid increases.
6.When vanadium oxide is supported on zirconia and titania, the vanadium ions act as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene. The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group, leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.
7.The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as seen in alkane oxidation. In pure V2O5, the active sites are primarily redox sites, while in pure Nb2O5, the active sites are essentially acidic in nature. The surface redox sites in pure V2O5 are more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5, and the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component. However, the presence of niobia enhances the activity of vanadia for reactions requiring a dual nature of redox and acid sites, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.

A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.570
Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In this sense, Zatorski et al.572 have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.573
Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process.
Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator. Tetralin, indone, and ethylbenzene have also been converted to the corresponding ketones.452,454,574 Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction.
Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.576
When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching.
Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.577,578 In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed.
A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 579-585 The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the λmax of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase.
By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity. The course of the irradiation can be followed and the reaction intermediates characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of zeolite wafers in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen have been coadsorbed from the vapor phase. In this way, cyclohexane can be oxidized by oxygen to cyclohexane hydroperoxide with an almost complete selectivity at very high cyclohexane conversion.
The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical. This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide.
In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized.
A heterogeneous cobalt catalyst based on an immobilized trimeric cobalt complex on MCM-41 has been claimed for the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in an aerobic system using the substrate as solvent. The turnover numbers are modest (2 mol/site/h). Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels.
An active epoxidation catalyst based on silica and MCM-supported metal complexes with the triazacyclononane ligand system has been prepared. 590 One of the N atoms is covalently linked to the silica wall through a glycidyl or chloropropyl linker. The other two N atoms were reacted with propylene oxide. Using the epoxidation of styrene as a test reaction, it was found the selectivities and turnover numbers are higher for MCM-derived materials than for silica.590
Liquid-phase partial oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds by air at atmospheric pressure has been conducted in the presence of chemically modified mesoporous silica containing chromium ions strongly coordinated to a carboxylate group covalently attached to the silica surface. 591 The preparation procedure is indicated in Scheme 47. This solid catalyst can effect the oxidation of neat ethylbenzene in air at reflux temperature with an isolated acetophenone yield of 50%. The catalyst was reused twice without any regeneration or conditioning treatment, by simply decanting the liquid from the reactor and adding fresh substrate. No leaching of the chromium was observed. The same catalyst also performs successfully for p-chlorotoluene and p-xylene.591 It was claimed that the activity of this mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst is significantly higher than the commercially supported chromium catalyst.
A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant. In general it can be said that the most important limitations for the use of liquid-phase olefin epoxidation using solid catalysts are the low rates and low turnover frequencies, together with the too low selectivity to the desired epoxide owing to the presence of less desired free radical chain reactions. 593
We have discussed above about the indirect way of using O2 as an oxidant to generate in situ H2O2 and using Ti-containing molecular sieves, as catalysts. Besides these interesting results, it has been recently described a non-molecular sieve oxidation catalysts formed by gold supported on TiO2. 594,595 This catalyst is able to generate in situ H2O2 and then to oxidize propylene to epoxide when a reactant mixture of propylene, O2, and H2 is used. An important catalyst characteristic is that Au particles must have a hemispherically shape with sizes between 2.0 and 4.0 nm in diameter. The formation of small Au particles on the surface of TiO2 is achieved by depositionprecipitation of Au(OH)3, starting from a basic solution of chloriauric acid at pH = 710. After washing the sample, the catalyst is calcined at 400 C to form the gold particles.
The catalyst active sites are believed to be TiAu bridged sites that would form the activated molecular oxygen species. Reaction with H2 forms the hydroperoxo species that will be responsible for the epoxidation of propylene.332 This mechanism implies that the active sites for the reaction must exist at the interfacial edge of the hemispherical Au particles and the TiO2 support. This, indeed, would be consistent with the observation that the activity of an Au-supported TiO2 catalyst is higher than that of Au/TS-1 at the same Au weight loadings and crystallite size.571
Direct epoxidation of propylene with O2 has been carried out using silver catalysts. If the silver ethylene oxidation catalyst is used directly for the epoxidation of propylene very poor results are obtained. However, activity and selectivity improve when silver powder is slurred with group IIA metal halides, or when silver is combined with K+ and CaCO3. 600-603 Promising catalytic systems based on the above ideas have been described by Gaffney et al. 604-608 These systems use silver catalyst modified by K, Cl, Mo, Re, W as promoters and CaCO3, together with the introduction in the reactor of chlorine (in the form of ethyl chloride, up to 500 ppm) and up to 500 ppm of NO. With this catalytic system, 3.2% conversion levels with 59% selectivity to propylene oxide are achieved, the yield being not high enough for commercial application.
Silver on alumina modified with Cs or Tl is a selective catalyst for the epoxidation of higher olefins that do not contain reactive allylic hydrogen atoms. 609-616 This catalyst was specially useful in the epoxidation of 1,4-butadiene (Scheme 48). The epoxidation of butadiene results in a selectivity to 1,2-epoxybutene of 95% with conversions close to 13%.
Besides butadiene, Monnier610 has reported the selective epoxidation of other higher nonallylic olefins as the ones summarized in Table 5 using Csl, CsCl, and RbCl promoted Ag/Al2O3 silver on alumina catalysts.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that TS-1 is an active zeolite for the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The reaction takes place on the outer surface of the solid particles on Lewis acid sites. Sulfation of the catalyst increases the acidity of external Lewis acid sites and results in an increase in the catalytic activity. Addition of water also causes an increase in the selectivity of the process, probably due to the competitive adsorption on the active sites. The maximum conversion was 17% with a selectivity to propene of 74%. The literature also discusses the importance of site isolation in the synthesis of Ti-silicalite (TS-1) as a catalyst for a series of useful oxidation reactions using H2O2 as oxidant. It appears that the site isolation resulting from the incorporation during the synthesis of the molecular sieves produces the most promising type of solid Lewis acids oxidation catalysts for liquid-phase operations. These Ti-containing silicalites should be, in principle, more stable toward leaching taking into account the lower accessibility of the TiO bonds.

The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).
For all the supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a parameter of paramount importance in the catalytic activity of the solid. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, thus, varying the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important reaction for the production of olefins and aromatics. The reaction is challenging due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the need for high selectivity to the desired products. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been widely studied for this reaction. The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation of the active metal centers can improve selectivity by preventing secondary reactions. However, achieving high conversion and selectivity simultaneously remains a challenge.

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a critical process for producing olefins and aromatics. It is a complex reaction due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes and the requirement for high selectivity to target products. Both bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been extensively researched for this purpose. The reaction mechanism generally includes C-H bond activation, the creation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation of active metal centers can enhance selectivity by avoiding secondary reactions. However, achieving both high conversion and selectivity concurrently is still a significant challenge.

Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In this sense, Zatorski et al.572 have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.573

Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.577,578 In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed.
A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 579-585 The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the λmax of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase.
By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity. The course of the irradiation can be followed and the reaction intermediates characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of zeolite wafers in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen have been coadsorbed from the vapor phase. In this way, cyclohexane can be oxidized by oxygen to cyclohexane hydroperoxide with an almost complete selectivity at very high cyclohexane conversion.
The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical. This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide.
In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that TS-1 is an active zeolite for the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The reaction takes place on the outer surface of the solid particles on Lewis acid sites. Sulfation of the catalyst increases the acidity of external Lewis acid sites and results in an increase in the catalytic activity. Addition of water also causes an increase in the selectivity of the process, probably due to the competitive adsorption on the active sites. The maximum conversion was 17% with a selectivity to propene of 74%. The literature also discusses the importance of site isolation in the incorporation of Ti in framework positions during the synthesis of molecular sieves, which produces the most promising type of solid Lewis acids oxidation catalysts for liquid-phase operations. These Ti-containing silicalites should be, in principle, more stable toward leaching taking into account the lower accessibility of the TiO bonds. The site isolation resulting from the incorporation during the synthesis of the molecular sieves produces the most promising type of solid Lewis acids oxidation catalysts for liquid-phase operations.

A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.570 Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1. The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide.
An optimized catalyst gives propylene oxide with selectivities up to 85% at conversions between 15 and 20%.75 Two drawbacks of this process is the need to operate under conditions close to the explosion limit, and the formation of propane coming from hydrogenation of propylene.
It is interesting to point out that when a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%).571 There is no doubt that this system deserves further work trying to find the reasons for the low conversion obtained.
Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.
Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process.
Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator.
Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction.
Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.
When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching.
Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.
In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed.

Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels.
A recent work has showed that Co and MnAlPO-18 is a regioselective oxidation catalyst for n-alkanes.
Because of the end-on approach of the n-paraffin in ALPO-18, owing to the pore dimensions and topology of this molecular sieve, only the C1 and C2 positions are preferentially oxidized.

In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. Thus, the active sites require a spatial organization at atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.31
The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).64
For instance, for the catalytic behavior of δ-alumina-supported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, it has been observed that the activity for dehydrogenation increases as the vanadium loading, while the selectivity toward alkene formation reaches a maximum at 34 wt %. 66 Apparently, the highest propene yields require of a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.66
The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation. Thus, studies of the structure and reactivity of group V metal oxides have been carried out by means of methanol adsorption and oxidation. 69 It has been found that the active sites present in pure V2O5 are primarily redox sites and the active sites in pure Nb2O5 are essentially acidic in nature. Furthermore, the surface redox sites present in pure V2O5 are orders of magnitude more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5 and consequently the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.69 However, niobia presence enhances significantly the activity of vanadia for those catalytic reactions that require a dual nature of redox and acid sites. This is the case of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases. 71
Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. 72 The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.72
The relative low activity toward alkane oxydehydrogenation as compared to other vanadia-supported selective oxidation catalysts such as V2O5/TiO2 and (VO)2P2O7 has been attributed to the basic environment generated by the MgO support, which causes a parallel decrease of the Lewis acidity influencing the oxidizing power of the active V ions. 70
The activity of these catalysts was also a function of the surface coverage. At very low conversions, formaldehyde selectivity increases linearly with the surface coverage, indicating that isolated V(V) species are responsible for the catalytic effect. In the case of V2O5 supported on SiO2, the selectivity reaches a maximum at 1%, and the decrease in the selectivity at higher coverages was explained as derived from an increase in the Lewis acid strength of the solid.40

2. The interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by factors such as the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanism, and the stability of the catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The presence of Lewis acid sites and basic sites in the catalysts facilitates the activation of the substrate and the oxidant, promoting the desired reaction pathways. The stability of the catalyst is also a critical factor, as it affects the longevity of the process and the overall efficiency. The use of supported systems can enhance the stability and selectivity of the catalyst by providing a suitable environment for the active sites and preventing their aggregation or deactivation.

The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases.
5.Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania, they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene. The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group, leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.
6.The activity and stability of solid catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming depend on the formation of carbon deposits due to methane decomposition into C and H2. The rate of carbon filament formation is proportional to the Ni particle size and may be interesting for the production of carbon nanotubes.
7.The conversion of methane into methyl formate with high molar yields (>12%) has been attained by a two-reactor system. In the first reactor, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is accomplished at 600-700 C on SiO2. Subsequently, formaldehyde is dimerized to methyl formate through a Cannizzaro disproportionation at 130-170 C on various metal oxides, including titania, silica, zirconia, and sulfated zirconia.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important reaction for the production of olefins and aromatics. The reaction is typically catalyzed by metal oxides, with the nature of the metal oxide playing a critical role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the reaction. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation and the formation of unwanted byproducts. Proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst, reaction conditions, and reactant properties. Site isolation, where the active sites of the catalyst are well-defined and isolated from each other, can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of unwanted byproducts.
