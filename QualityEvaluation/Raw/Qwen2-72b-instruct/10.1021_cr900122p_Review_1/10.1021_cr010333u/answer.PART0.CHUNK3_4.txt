[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important reaction for the production of olefins and aromatics. The reaction is typically catalyzed by metal oxides, with the nature of the metal oxide playing a critical role in determining the selectivity and conversion of the reaction. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation and the formation of unwanted byproducts. Proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst, reaction conditions, and reactant properties. Site isolation, where the active sites of the catalyst are well-defined and isolated from each other, can help address selectivity issues by preventing the formation of unwanted byproducts."
