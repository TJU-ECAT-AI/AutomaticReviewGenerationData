[1] "A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.570"
[2] "Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In this sense, Zatorski et al.572 have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.573"
[3] "Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process."
[4] "Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator. Tetralin, indone, and ethylbenzene have also been converted to the corresponding ketones.452,454,574 Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction."
[5] "Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.576"
[6] "When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching."
[7] "Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.577,578 In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed."
[8] "A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 579-585 The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the Î»max of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase."
[9] "By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity. The course of the irradiation can be followed and the reaction intermediates characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of zeolite wafers in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen have been coadsorbed from the vapor phase. In this way, cyclohexane can be oxidized by oxygen to cyclohexane hydroperoxide with an almost complete selectivity at very high cyclohexane conversion."
[10] "The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical. This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide."
[11] "In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized."
[12] "A heterogeneous cobalt catalyst based on an immobilized trimeric cobalt complex on MCM-41 has been claimed for the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in an aerobic system using the substrate as solvent. The turnover numbers are modest (2 mol/site/h). Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels."
[13] "An active epoxidation catalyst based on silica and MCM-supported metal complexes with the triazacyclononane ligand system has been prepared. 590 One of the N atoms is covalently linked to the silica wall through a glycidyl or chloropropyl linker. The other two N atoms were reacted with propylene oxide. Using the epoxidation of styrene as a test reaction, it was found the selectivities and turnover numbers are higher for MCM-derived materials than for silica.590"
[14] "Liquid-phase partial oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds by air at atmospheric pressure has been conducted in the presence of chemically modified mesoporous silica containing chromium ions strongly coordinated to a carboxylate group covalently attached to the silica surface. 591 The preparation procedure is indicated in Scheme 47. This solid catalyst can effect the oxidation of neat ethylbenzene in air at reflux temperature with an isolated acetophenone yield of 50%. The catalyst was reused twice without any regeneration or conditioning treatment, by simply decanting the liquid from the reactor and adding fresh substrate. No leaching of the chromium was observed. The same catalyst also performs successfully for p-chlorotoluene and p-xylene.591 It was claimed that the activity of this mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst is significantly higher than the commercially supported chromium catalyst."
[15] "A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant. In general it can be said that the most important limitations for the use of liquid-phase olefin epoxidation using solid catalysts are the low rates and low turnover frequencies, together with the too low selectivity to the desired epoxide owing to the presence of less desired free radical chain reactions. 593"
[16] "We have discussed above about the indirect way of using O2 as an oxidant to generate in situ H2O2 and using Ti-containing molecular sieves, as catalysts. Besides these interesting results, it has been recently described a non-molecular sieve oxidation catalysts formed by gold supported on TiO2. 594,595 This catalyst is able to generate in situ H2O2 and then to oxidize propylene to epoxide when a reactant mixture of propylene, O2, and H2 is used. An important catalyst characteristic is that Au particles must have a hemispherically shape with sizes between 2.0 and 4.0 nm in diameter. The formation of small Au particles on the surface of TiO2 is achieved by depositionprecipitation of Au(OH)3, starting from a basic solution of chloriauric acid at pH = 710. After washing the sample, the catalyst is calcined at 400 C to form the gold particles."
[17] "The catalyst active sites are believed to be TiAu bridged sites that would form the activated molecular oxygen species. Reaction with H2 forms the hydroperoxo species that will be responsible for the epoxidation of propylene.332 This mechanism implies that the active sites for the reaction must exist at the interfacial edge of the hemispherical Au particles and the TiO2 support. This, indeed, would be consistent with the observation that the activity of an Au-supported TiO2 catalyst is higher than that of Au/TS-1 at the same Au weight loadings and crystallite size.571"
[18] "Direct epoxidation of propylene with O2 has been carried out using silver catalysts. If the silver ethylene oxidation catalyst is used directly for the epoxidation of propylene very poor results are obtained. However, activity and selectivity improve when silver powder is slurred with group IIA metal halides, or when silver is combined with K+ and CaCO3. 600-603 Promising catalytic systems based on the above ideas have been described by Gaffney et al. 604-608 These systems use silver catalyst modified by K, Cl, Mo, Re, W as promoters and CaCO3, together with the introduction in the reactor of chlorine (in the form of ethyl chloride, up to 500 ppm) and up to 500 ppm of NO. With this catalytic system, 3.2% conversion levels with 59% selectivity to propylene oxide are achieved, the yield being not high enough for commercial application."
[19] "Silver on alumina modified with Cs or Tl is a selective catalyst for the epoxidation of higher olefins that do not contain reactive allylic hydrogen atoms. 609-616 This catalyst was specially useful in the epoxidation of 1,4-butadiene (Scheme 48). The epoxidation of butadiene results in a selectivity to 1,2-epoxybutene of 95% with conversions close to 13%."
[20] "Besides butadiene, Monnier610 has reported the selective epoxidation of other higher nonallylic olefins as the ones summarized in Table 5 using Csl, CsCl, and RbCl promoted Ag/Al2O3 silver on alumina catalysts."
