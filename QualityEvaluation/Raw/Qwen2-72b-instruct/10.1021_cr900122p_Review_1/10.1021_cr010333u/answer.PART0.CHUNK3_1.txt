[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important reaction for the production of olefins and oxygenates. The process is challenging due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the need for high selectivity to desired products. Bulk metal oxides and supported metal catalysts have been studied for ODH. Proposed mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation can improve selectivity by preventing secondary reactions."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is crucial for producing olefins and oxygenates. However, the process is complex due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes and the requirement for high selectivity to targeted products. Both bulk metal oxides and supported metal catalysts have been explored for ODH. The suggested mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Site isolation plays a critical role in enhancing selectivity by avoiding secondary reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the process.
