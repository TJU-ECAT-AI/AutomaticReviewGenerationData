          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging process due to the high stability of C-H bonds in alkanes and the need for high selectivity to desired products.
          Bulk metal oxides and supported metal oxide catalysts have been extensively studied for ODH reactions.
          Achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions requires careful control of the catalyst structure and the reaction conditions.
          Proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction.
          The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst structure, reaction conditions, and the proposed reaction mechanisms.
          Site isolation plays a critical role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing side reactions and promoting the desired reaction pathways.
          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes and the requirement for high selectivity to targeted products.
          Both bulk metal oxides and supported metal catalysts have been explored for ODH.
          The suggested mechanisms involve C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction.
          Site isolation plays a critical role in enhancing selectivity by avoiding secondary reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the process.
          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.
          The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst, the reaction conditions, and the proposed reaction mechanisms.
          The C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction are key steps in the ODH process.
          The efficiency of the process is influenced by the ability of the catalyst to activate the C-H bond and facilitate the subsequent steps.
          Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions.
          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.
          The active sites in these catalysts require a spatial organization at the atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms, such as metallic cations acting as Lewis acid sites and surface O= or OH- species serving as basic sites.
          The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during the reaction.
          The activation energy of the ODH step depends on the identity of the cation, with the order being VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2.
          Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions also depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane.
          The Lewis acidity of the cations influences the adsorption enthalpies, with the acidity increasing in the order V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+.
          This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion.
          For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a critical parameter affecting the catalytic activity.
          As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, changing the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties.
          The highest propene yields are achieved with a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.
          The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be enhanced by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as seen in alkane oxidation.
          In pure V2O5, the active sites are primarily redox sites, while in pure Nb2O5, the active sites are essentially acidic in nature.
          The surface redox sites in pure V2O5 are more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5, and the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.
          However, the presence of niobia enhances the activity of vanadia for reactions requiring a dual nature of redox and acid sites, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
          The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on various oxides for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein increases as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species on the solid increases.
          When vanadium oxide is supported on zirconia and titania, the vanadium ions act as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene.
          The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group, leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.

          The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during the reaction.
          The activation energy of the ODH step depends on the identity of the cation, with the order being VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2.
          Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions also depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane.
          The Lewis acidity of the cations influences the adsorption enthalpies, with the acidity increasing in the order V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+.
          This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion.
          For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a critical parameter affecting the catalytic activity.
          As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, changing the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties.
          The highest propene yields are achieved with a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.
          The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be enhanced by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as seen in alkane oxidation.
          In pure V2O5, the active sites are primarily redox sites, while in pure Nb2O5, the active sites are essentially acidic in nature.
          The surface redox sites in pure V2O5 are more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5, and the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.
          However, the presence of niobia enhances the activity of vanadia for reactions requiring a dual nature of redox and acid sites, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
          The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on various oxides for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein increases as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species on the solid increases.
          When vanadium oxide is supported on zirconia and titania, the vanadium ions act as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene.
          The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group, leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.
          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.
          The active sites require a spatial organization at the atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms, such as metallic cations acting as Lewis acid sites and surface O= or OH- species serving as basic sites.
