1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant, and the proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues.
2.In the first step of the ODH process, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. The active sites require a spatial organization at the atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.
3.The activity of catalysts for ODH is a function of the surface coverage. At very low conversions, formaldehyde selectivity increases linearly with the surface coverage, indicating that isolated V(V) species are responsible for the catalytic effect.
4.The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as in alkane oxidation. The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases.
5.Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania, they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene. The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group, leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.
6.The activity and stability of solid catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming depend on the formation of carbon deposits due to methane decomposition into C and H2. The rate of carbon filament formation is proportional to the Ni particle size and may be interesting for the production of carbon nanotubes.
7.The conversion of methane into methyl formate with high molar yields (>12%) has been attained by a two-reactor system. In the first reactor, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is accomplished at 600-700 C on SiO2. Subsequently, formaldehyde is dimerized to methyl formate through a Cannizzaro disproportionation at 130-170 C on various metal oxides, including titania, silica, zirconia, and sulfated zirconia.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及各种催化剂（包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统）之间的相互作用。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战是显著的，提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象。这些因素共同影响过程效率，而位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。
2.在ODH过程的第一步中，金属阳离子充当路易斯酸位点，而碱性位点是表面O=或OH-物种。底物经历氢抽象、氧插入和电子转移。活性位点需要在原子水平上的空间组织和独特原子之间的合作。
3.催化剂在ODH中的活性是表面覆盖度的函数。在非常低的转化率下，甲醛选择性随着表面覆盖度的增加而线性增加，表明孤立的V(V)物种对催化作用负责。
4.钒氧化物的催化活性可以通过支撑材料的路易斯酸辅助来增强，如在烷烃氧化中。Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox在δ-氧化铝、二氧化钛、二氧化硅、铌酸和氧化锆上的活性被发现随着固体上红氧活性VOx物种周围路易斯酸位点的数量增加而增加。
5.虽然在钒氧化物上的钒离子通常作为氧化还原位点，但当支撑在氧化锆和二氧化钛上时，它们也作为足够强的路易斯酸位点，可以与甲苯和间二甲苯形成π复合物。这些π复合物的甲基基团变得活化，并通过VO基团的氢抽象，导致苯基物种和苯甲醛的形成。
6.固体催化剂在甲烷-CO2重整中的活性和稳定性取决于甲烷分解成C和H2形成的碳沉积物。碳丝的形成速率与Ni颗粒尺寸成正比，这可能对碳纳米管的生产感兴趣。
7.通过两反应器系统，甲烷转化为甲酸甲酯的高摩尔产率（>12%）已经实现。在第一个反应器中，在SiO2上以600-700°C的温度完成甲烷的部分氧化为甲醛。随后，通过在包括二氧化钛、二氧化硅、氧化锆和硫酸锆在内的各种金属氧化物上在130-170°C下进行Cannizzaro不等化，将甲醛二聚为甲酸甲酯。
