[1] "In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. Thus, the active sites require a spatial organization at atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.31"
[2] "The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).64"
[3] "For all the supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a parameter of paramount importance in the catalytic activity of the solid. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, thus, varying the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties. For instance, for the catalytic behavior of δ-alumina-supported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, it has been observed that the activity for dehydrogenation increases as the vanadium loading, while the selectivity toward alkene formation reaches a maximum at 34 wt %. 66 Apparently, the highest propene yields require of a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.66"
[4] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation. Thus, studies of the structure and reactivity of group V metal oxides have been carried out by means of methanol adsorption and oxidation. 69 It has been found that the active sites present in pure V2O5 are primarily redox sites and the active sites in pure Nb2O5 are essentially acidic in nature. Furthermore, the surface redox sites present in pure V2O5 are orders of magnitude more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5 and consequently the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.69 However, niobia presence enhances significantly the activity of vanadia for those catalytic reactions that require a dual nature of redox and acid sites. This is the case of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx."
[5] "The activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases. 71"
[6] "Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. 72 The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.72"

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that involves the interplay between various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The active sites in these catalysts require a spatial organization at the atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms, such as metallic cations acting as Lewis acid sites and surface O= or OH- species serving as basic sites. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during the reaction.
2.The activation energy of the ODH step depends on the identity of the cation, with the order being VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions also depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The Lewis acidity of the cations influences the adsorption enthalpies, with the acidity increasing in the order V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion.
3.For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a critical parameter affecting the catalytic activity. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, changing the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties. The highest propene yields are achieved with a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.
4.The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be enhanced by Lewis acid assistance of the support, as seen in alkane oxidation. In pure V2O5, the active sites are primarily redox sites, while in pure Nb2O5, the active sites are essentially acidic in nature. The surface redox sites in pure V2O5 are more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5, and the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component. However, the presence of niobia enhances the activity of vanadia for reactions requiring a dual nature of redox and acid sites, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，涉及各种催化剂之间的相互作用，包括块状金属氧化物和支撑系统。这些催化剂中的活性位点在原子水平上需要空间组织，并且需要不同原子之间的合作，例如金属阳离子作为路易斯酸位点，表面O=或OH-物种作为碱性位点。底物在反应过程中经历氢原子抽离、氧插入和电子转移。
2.ODH步骤的活化能取决于阳离子的性质，其顺序为VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2。丙烷氧化脱氢的活化能高于丙烯燃烧，但这些反应的相对速率也取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓。路易斯酸性阳离子的酸性影响吸附焓，其酸性增加的顺序为V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+。这解释了丙烷氧化脱氢和丙烯燃烧之间观察到的活化能差异。
3.对于支撑的五氧化二钒催化剂，五氧化二钒的负载量是影响催化活性的关键参数。随着五氧化二钒负载量的增加，会发生聚集，改变五氧化二钒物种的性质及其催化性能。获得最高丙烯产量需要固体含有适当电位的氧化还原位点，结合强路易斯酸位点和温和的碱性位点。
4.五氧化二钒的催化活性可以通过支撑材料的路易斯酸辅助来增强，如在烷烃氧化中所见。在纯V2O5中，活性位点主要是氧化还原位点，而在纯Nb2O5中，活性位点本质上是酸性的。纯V2O5中的表面氧化还原位点比纯Nb2O5中的表面酸位点更活跃，V2O5/Nb2O5混合氧化物的催化活性主要由五氧化二钒组分主导。然而，铌酸盐的存在增强了五氧化二钒在需要氧化还原和酸性位点双重性质的反应中的活性，例如丁烷氧化为马来酸酐和NOx选择性氧化氨。
5.Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox在各种氧化物上的直接丙烷转化为丙烯醛的活性随着固体上围绕氧化活性VOx物种的路易斯酸位点数量的增加而增加。
6.当五氧化二钒支撑在二氧化锆和二氧化钛上时，五氧化二钒离子作为足够强的路易斯酸位点，与甲苯和m-二甲苯形成π复合物。这些π复合物的甲基基团变得活化，并通过VO基团进行氢原子抽离，导致生成苄基物种和苯甲醛。
