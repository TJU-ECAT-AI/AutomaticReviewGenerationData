[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important reaction for the production of olefins and oxygenates. The selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions are influenced by the type of catalyst used, with bulk metal oxides and supported systems showing different performance. Site isolation on supported catalysts can help address selectivity issues by preventing side reactions. Reaction mechanisms proposed for ODH include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the ODH process."
