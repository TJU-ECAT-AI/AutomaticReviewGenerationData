[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
[4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out [35]."
[5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
[6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
[8] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
[9] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."
[10] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
[11] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
[12] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
[13] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
[14] "The structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by P2O7 pyrophosphate groups."
[15] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
[16] "It has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
[17] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
[18] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
[19] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
[20] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
[21] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
[22] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
[23] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
[24] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
[25] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
[26] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
[27] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
[28] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
[29] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5+/V4+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
[30] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
[31] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
[32] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
[33] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
[34] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
[35] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
[36] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
[37] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
[38] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
[39] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
[40] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
[41] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
[42] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of V4+."
[43] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
[44] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
[45] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
[46] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by the fact that after the first reduction, the solid undergoes redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac- teristic of a p-type semiconductor."
[47] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V40:64V30:28Sb50:92(0:16O4 ! V40:642xV30:282xSb50:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O."
[48] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface."
[49] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
[50] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
[51] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
[52] "It corresponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
[53] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
[54] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O)."
[55] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
[56] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
[57] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
[58] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
[59] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
[60] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
[61] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O."
[62] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process that poses significant challenges to both industrial and academic researchers in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Efficient catalysts, such as VPO or VSbO-based systems, have been developed to overcome the activation step of alkanes, which is crucial for the process. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion remains difficult due to the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps that occur simultaneously on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, but no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule corresponds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties like strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species. The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, and their presence in oxidation catalysts should be related to structure defects. The dynamic nature of a catalytic oxide surface suggests that the concept of localized active sites should be taken with caution. A complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate encompassing the dynamics of the surface and the adsorbed species, as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid. Electrical conductivity measurements can provide information on the existence of oxidizing species and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions, characterizing the structure defects and helping to identify the active oxygen species. The efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species.
