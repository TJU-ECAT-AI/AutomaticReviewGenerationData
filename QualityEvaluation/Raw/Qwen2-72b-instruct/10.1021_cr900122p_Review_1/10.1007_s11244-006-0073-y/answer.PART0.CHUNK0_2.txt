[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[3] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]."
[4] "All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Bro nsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O) or O2 )."
[5] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
[6] "Furthermore their presence in oxida- tion catalysts should be related to structure defects like cations with different oxidation state or vacancies."
[7] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging yet promising area in heterogeneous catalysis, with efficient catalysts like VPO or VSbO systems providing unique mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation. Various mechanisms for light alkane activation have been proposed, involving sites with specific properties such as strong Bronsted acidity, Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or electrophilic species like O) or O2). These properties are distinct from those required for efficient alkene oxidation, which necessitates long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility. The presence of such species in oxidation catalysts is often linked to structural defects, such as cations with different oxidation states or vacancies. Site isolation plays a crucial role in stabilizing active species that are intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, contributing to the selectivity and efficiency of the ODH process.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是异相催化领域一个充满挑战但前景光明的课题，高效的催化剂如VPO或VSbO系统提供了独特的烃类活化机制。提出了各种轻烷烃活化的机制，涉及具有特定性质的位点，如强布朗斯特酸性、与碱性氧结合的强路易斯酸性或像O)或O2)这样的亲电性物种。这些性质与高效烯烃氧化所需的性质不同，后者需要长程电子离域和高电子流动性。这些物种在氧化催化剂中的存在通常与结构缺陷有关，如具有不同氧化态的阳离子或空位。位点隔离在稳定活性物种中起着关键作用，这些活性物种是晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间的中间体，对ODH过程的选择性和效率有贡献。
