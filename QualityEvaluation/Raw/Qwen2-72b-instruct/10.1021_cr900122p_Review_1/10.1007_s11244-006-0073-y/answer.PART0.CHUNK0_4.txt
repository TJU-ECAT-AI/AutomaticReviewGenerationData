The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, each with specific properties that influence the activation of alkanes. The efficiency of the process is affected by the ability of the catalyst to abstract hydrogen from the alkane molecule, with the active sites typically corresponding to oxygen species (O). The complexity of the reaction arises from the multitude of possible pathways and steps occurring on the adsorbed phase. Achieving high selectivity and conversion is challenging due to the need for precise control over the reaction mechanisms, such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The presence of structure defects in the catalysts, like cations with different oxidation states or vacancies, is crucial for the stabilization of active species that are intermediate between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing these active species, which are essential for the activation of alkanes.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统，每种催化剂具有特定的性质，影响烷烃的活化。过程的效率受到催化剂从烷烃分子中抽氢能力的影响，活性位点通常对应于氧物种（O）。反应的复杂性源于吸附相上可能的多种途径和步骤。实现高选择性和转化率具有挑战性，因为需要精确控制反应机制，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H抽提。催化剂中结构缺陷的存在，如具有不同氧化态的阳离子或空位，对于稳定活性物种至关重要，这些活性物种介于晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中发挥着重要作用，通过稳定这些活性物种，这些物种对于烷烃的活化至关重要。
