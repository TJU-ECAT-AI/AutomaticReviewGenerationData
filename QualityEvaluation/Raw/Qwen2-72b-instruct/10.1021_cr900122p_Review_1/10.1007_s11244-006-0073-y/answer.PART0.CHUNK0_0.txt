[1] "The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic researchers as a difficult but promising challenge in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro- carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."
[3] "The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac- tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb- ing."
[4] "Different pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism stands out."
[5] "The goal of this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation site to several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation."
[6] "The first step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor- responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed."
[8] "All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Bro nsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O) or O2 )."
[9] "The properties of these species do not fit with those required for efficient alkene oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility."
[10] "Furthermore their presence in oxida- tion catalysts should be related to structure defects like cations with different oxidation state or vacancies."
[11] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod- eling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species."
[12] "When attempting to describe a reaction mechanism,bulk properties are often neglected since they may not lead directly to a catalytic site description and cannot systematically account for surface properties."
[13] "However among these properties, electrical conductivity should be considered differently."
[14] "The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:r  elhp  elen 1 where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons (e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and hole concentration."
[15] "The conduction mechanism can be identified by perturbing the charge carrier concentration using O2 as a probe."
[16] "p-type semi-conductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2) anions, Mx+O(x/2) 2) i.e., cationic vacancies in closed- packed oxide structures."
[17] "n-type semiconductors are characterized by a deficit in lattice O2) anions Mx+O(x/2) 2) accounted for by the existence of anionic vacancies VO2."
[18] "From a chemical point of view a hole h+ corresponds to a O) according to the reaction: O2  h ! O 2"
[19] "It is important to recall that these O) species cannot be only considered as surface species but also bulk species in equilibrium with O2)."
[20] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."
[21] "It has also been proposed that weakly adsorbed sur- face oxygen species could activate the first CH bond [26]."
[22] "However, it has been shown that n-butane could be activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was confirmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products came from the lattice [28]."
[23] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1)."
[24] "In the first one, the n-butane mole- cule is dehydrogenated with the concerted removal of two hydrogen atoms as H) and H+ on an acidbase VIVO couple (figure 1a) [29]."
[25] "Two other proposed mechanisms involved peroxo or superoxo species formed by the interaction of a chemisorbed di-oxygen molecule on a surface vanadium cation with an incom- plete coordination and Lewis acid properties [30,31]."
[26] "In the first one, the simultaneous abstraction of two hydrogens on the g2-peroxo species would occur (fig- ure 1b) whereas in the second, H abstraction from a methylene group would first proceed to give a surface hydroperoxide group with the formation of a surface alkoxide group from the formed alkyl radical on the adjacent vanadyl group (figure 1c)."
[27] "The hydroxide group would then abstract hydrogen from the alkoxide group generating adsorbed butene or 2-butanone."
[28] "Interestingly, it was reported in this later case that a V5 +O) site could be formed either by oxygen transfer between a superoxo site and a free neighboring site or by direct re-oxidation of a completely reduced site (fig- ure 2)."
[29] "These species would be active but less than the superoxo ones [31]."
[30] "Finally, a fourth mechanism, not schematized, was based upon the direct interaction of the alkane molecule with a surface transition metal cation with the direct transfer of two electrons from the hydrocarbon to the same cation and formations of a proton and a carbocation immediately attacked by lat- tice oxygen to lead to a surface alkoxide [32]."
[31] "It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase was a p-type semi-conductor [33]."
[32] "The behavior of the solid, which is that of a p-type semi-conductor, is reversible and typical of a redox mechanism since the same n-butane/O2 sequences provide identical variations of r."
[33] "Furthermore it appears that (VO)2P2O7 remains a p-type semi-conductor even under the reducing conditions of a catalytic test."
[34] "This implies that even in the presence of surface anionic vacancies whose formation in the conditions of catalysis is inevitable, the main charge carrier remains positive holes."
[35] "O) chemical species thus are present and should play a role in activating n-butane."
[36] "The existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy (h in figure 2b) is improbable although the presence of protons would fit with Bro nsted sites titration with K + experiments showing surface protons concentration twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0) plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies would fit with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V ratio greater than one."
[37] "An interpretation of XPS char- acterization of VPO catalysts, proposed that there was not an excess of phosphorus at the surface as usually reported but rather a lack of vanadium [35]."
[38] "Although it may be difficult to think that the presence of vanadium vacancies could account exclusively for the P/V ratio experimentally measured, it could participate to it in a defective surface."
[39] "The presence of phosphates or pyro- phosphates groups at the surface cannot be disputed and it is now well accepted that they may help in electrostatic docking of n-butane molecules at the surface and pro- vide a source of selective oxygen species for further transformation of activated n-butane."
[40] "It can be observed that both sites show the presence of V5 +, which is sup- ported by many experimental data."
[41] "The more probable catalytic site should be that of figure 2(a) already pos- tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:"
[42] "C4H10  O2  O  V5 ! C4H8  2OH  V4"
[43] "The two neighboring close sites would allow two methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination between methylene and methyl CH bond observed [25,26]."
[44] "The reaction could also proceed with a first H abstraction on a O) and the formation of an alkoxide species."
[45] "C4H10  O2  O  V5 ! C4H9O  OH  V4"
[46] "In fact, as already proposed O), superoxo O2) or peroxo species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation and interconversion pathways exist between these spe- cies (figure 4) [31]."
[47] "The role of a superoxide or peroxo species had already been proposed in the case of other light alkanes activation although they should not be stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su- peroxo species by EPR."
[48] "Based on calculation and modeling of vanadium oxide clusters, Witko et al. [36,37] have suggested that a general feature of CH activation at the surface of a transition metal oxide with semi-conducting properties is that both parts of the cleaved CH bond become attached to the surface oxide ions."
[49] "The protons form OH groups and the hydrocarbon fragments form alkoxy groups as demonstrated by an IR study [38]."
[50] "The involvement of an alkoxide that should be unstable is still under debate."
[51] "Finally it cannot be excluded that the reaction could proceed without direct reduction of vanadium cations but with the consumption of a posi- tive hole of the valence band."
[52] "The involvement of O) species for light alkanes activation has already been suggested from thermody- namic considerations [39]."
[53] "It was proposed that the activation of the first CH bond of an alkane involved very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro- posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role."
[54] "However it has been often stressed that very weakly bound surface O) promoted the formation of CC cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation."
[55] "It is important to note that the O) species proposed to be involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,although they present electrophilic properties, should be more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility."
[56] "Furthermore if weakly chemisorbed oxygen species were involved in the p-type semi-conductivity, they would induce a dependency of the electrical conductivity on the oxygen pressure when measured under pure oxygen,which is not what has been observed [33]."
[57] "Indeed, the fact that the electrical conductivity was almost inde- pendent of the oxygen partial pressure under pure oxy- gen in the range of pressure studied, could only be explained by the fact that the source of electrical charge carriers was independent of the oxygen partial pressure."
[58] "The same observation was made in the case study of titanium pyrophosphate presented later."
[59] "There has been no spectroscopic evidence of O) on vanadium pyrophosphate."
[60] "It is probable that for the site described, a dipolar interaction between the paramag- netic centers (O)O) or O)V4 +) prevented their observation by EPR."
[61] "The line width of the signals that would be observed may increase to the extent that the O) species become EPR invisible."
[62] "Dopants have been shown to influence strongly the catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]."
[63] "Since the addition of such dopant may have strong effects on the texture or crystallinity of the catalyst and thus on the exposed active planes of the (VO)2P2O7 phase, it is often difficult to differentiate between these effects and an intrinsic modification of the catalytic sites."
[64] "They have been shown to modify the V4
+/V5
+ ratio as well as the P/V ratio but no direct interpretation of the effect on the catalytic sites has been proposed although enhancement or decrease of the catalyst activity are observed."
[65] "Among the dopants, one of the most interesting and efficient one is cobalt."
[66] "It allows the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride to be selectively conducted on the VPO cat- alyst under fuel rich conditions (n-C4/O2 = 0.6) whereas the undoped catalyst rapidly deactivates under the same conditions (figure 5a) [42,43]."
[67] "It has been shown that Co favored a higher V5
+/V4
+ ratio under fuel rich condition and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P and O atoms [44]."
[68] "These results, which tend to confirm that V5+ were necessary to activate n-butane, were not discussed in terms of active site modification."
[69] "In fuel rich conditions, the increase of activity should decrease the surface oxygen content destabilizing the proposed catalytic sites with excess of oxygen anions or cationic vacancies."
[70] "In fact the substitution at the surface of a V4 + by a divalent metal like Co2 + can be balanced by the presence of a V5 + and an O) (figure 5b)."
[71] "This should lead to a stable catalytic site working efficiently in fuel rich conditions."
[72] "Other divalent cations could play the same role if they could enter the structure."
[73] "However only two have a sufficiently small size to substitute to tetravalent vanadium cations: Co2 + and Fe2 +."
[74] "Fe2 + has been shown to oxidize to Fe3 + when introduced as dopant and appears thus less active [45]."
[75] "Tetravalent pyrophosphates like ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 have been shown to be active and selective catalysts for n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation [4648]."
[76] "Two types of reaction mechanism take place on these compounds."
[77] "One takes place on ZrP2O7 at any temperature and TiP2O7 below 450 C and the other on TiP2O7 above 450 C."
[78] "These mechanisms are characterized by different activation energies for the transformation of n-butane as shown in figure 6."
[79] "In the structure of these compounds, each tetravalent cation is isolated from each other by pyrophosphate groups."
[80] "The two most efficient catalysts ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air with positive holes as the main charge carriers like (VO)2P2O7."
[81] "They became n-type when contacted with n- butane [47] (figure 7)."
[82] "If their conductivities were com- parable as p-type semiconductors (within one order of magnitude) they differ by three orders of magnitude when being n-type semiconductors."
[83] "These results explained the difference in catalytic reaction mechanism encountered on the two solids."
[84] "The alkane activation can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con- ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen abstraction by a surface O) species."
[85] "However on ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a C4H9 radical."
[86] "The formed radical has to migrate to another Zr site to similarly undergo a second hydrogen abstraction to form a butene molecule:"
[87] "C4H10  O ! C4H
9  OH"
[88] "C4H
9  O ! C4H8  OH"
[89] "In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced."
[90] "However above this temperature, it has been shown that Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring that has not yet been completely elucidated."
[91] "It may be postulated that the same type of mechanism as previ- ously described may occur [48]: C4H10  O  Ti4  O2 ! C4H8  Ti3  2OH"
[92] "C4H10  O  Ti4  O2 ! OC4H9  Ti3  OH"
[93] "A reaction with an electron trapped at an oxide vacancy on the surface has also been proposed [49]."
[94] "It is interesting to note that a linear relation has been observed between the rate of n-butane transformation and the amount of reducible titanium cations by n-butane in the catalysts determined by EPR."
[95] "Further- more O2 ) have been identified by EPR at the surface of TiP2O7 when O2 was adsorbed at room temperature after reduction by n-butane at 500 C."
[96] "These latter species may be the precursors to the formation of the active O) species or may also be considered as possible active species."
[97] "The two mechanisms have different activation ener- gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is different."
[98] "On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on TiP2O7 at high temperature."
[99] "In the first case, after the first methylene H abstraction, the probability for the second H abstraction is independant of the first abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative abundance of the different species (6/4)."
[100] "The same ratio had already been observed in the case of V/MgO cata- lysts and was explained by the formation of very reactive butyl radicals [50]."
[101] "In the second case, the mechanism would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil- ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics (1/2)."
[102] "VSbO catalysts have extensively been studied for the ammoxidation of propane into acrylonitrile [5153]."
[103] "The VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the VSbO4 phase [52]."
[104] "Its structure is derived from TiO2 rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted by one V and Sb cation with a cation deficiency related to the presence of
V4+,
leading to the formula
V4+
0.64V3+
0.28Sb5+
0.92h0.16O4 where h stands for cat-
ionic vacancy [54]."
[105] "This phase is neither stable under oxygen nor under catalytic conditions and transforma- tions occur at least at the surface."
[106] "In the first case V2O5 is formed [55] and in the second case, Sb2O4 [56]."
[107] "The addition of dopants like Ti, Al or Fe stabilizing the active rutile phase appeared thus necessary to achieve high catalytic efficiency [5557]."
[108] "The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58]."
[109] "This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as the main charge carriers."
[110] "The study of the changes in the electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane (figure 8)."
[111] "This can only be explained by a change in the structure of the compound, at least in the surface region."
[112] "The existence of such irreversible change is supported by -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 sequence duration (min) log σ

[113] "The first increase in electrical conductivity under propane is related to that of the free electron concentration originating from ion- ized anionic vacancies formation according to the reaction:xC3H8  V4
0:64V3
0:28Sb5
0:92(0:16O4 ! V4
0:642x
V3
0:282xSb5
0:92(0:16O4x  xC3H6  xH2O"
[114] "The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies is not stable and a phase transformation should occur leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the surface:"
[115] "V4
0:642xV3

0:282:18xSb5
0:92(0:160:5xO4  0:22x Sb2O4"
[116] "Since in the rutile type structure of the vanadium antimonate the V and Sb cations as well as the cationic vacancies are randomly distributed on the crystallo- graphic sites, it is difficult to describe a precise catalytic site for the activation of alkane molecules."
[117] "However, all the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre- spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy [59,60]."
[118] "Such arrangement should induce the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of the alkane molecule."
[119] "A reaction mechanism has been proposed that involves such catalytic site and was written as [59]: C3H8 (VOSbOV ! C3H6  (V OH  SbOHV"
[120] "SbNHSbC3H6  3=2O2 ! SbOSb
C3H3N  2H2O"
[121] "In this study, it was proposed that NH3 was apt to react with SbOSb next to cation vacancies and that the formation of SbNHSb next to the defect site was advantageous for the N insertion step because of a steric effect."
[122] "It can be recalled that it had been established that antimony moieties are active for the formation of acrylonitrile, and a bridging SbNHSb species is responsible for the nitrogen insertion [61]."
[123] "When Ti and Fe were studied as substituants, it was observed that they exhibited opposite effects."
[124] "Ti has a negative effect on the activity but a positive one on the selectivity to acrylonitrile and Fe the contrary [62,63]."
[125] "The study of the iron substitution at low loading has shown that Fe3 + was substituting V4 + with the forma- tion of an anionic vacancy for charge balance instead of
V3
+."
[126] "Fe3 + should participate to the vanadium isolation but should not substitute vanadium neighboring a cat- ionic vacancy that would have led to an unstable structure."
[127] "From results of earlier study [64], Ti4 + should exchange with all V4 +, including the V cations neigh- boring vacancies, which would explain the decrease in activity."
[128] "It should stabilize the rutile-type phase and participate to the isolation of vanadium species without implying the formation of oxygen vacancies thus improving the selectivity towards acrylonitrile."
[129] "The MoVTe(Sb)NbO mixed oxides catalysts have recently been shown to be efficient for the oxidation and ammoxidation of propane [65]."
[130] "They typically contain two phases called M1 and M2."
[131] "It is accepted that the M1 phase is the only active and selective phase but the M2 may intervene in the case of Te containing phase mix- tures by synergetically increasing the yield in acrylic acid or acrylonitrile."
[132] "The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved and its detailed composition determined [66]."
[133] "It corre- sponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and Nb) sharing corners or edges (figure 9a)."
[134] "These octahe- dra are forming hexagonal and heptagonal channels."
[135] "The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan- nels."
[136] "The oxidation states of the cations in the structure have been determined and the stoichiometry of the phase can be written as (AO)2)2x(A2O)xM20O56 with A = Sb or Te, M = Mo,V,Nb and 0  x  1 [67,68]."
[137] "The V/Mo and Nb/Mo ratios can vary, but are close to
0.3 and 0.1 respectively."
[138] "It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7 position in the structure and that the activity of this site was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O):"
[139] "V5  O2V4O"
[140] "This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from the propane molecule at the methylene position to produce a secondary propyl radical."
[141] "A second step would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen on a neighboring tellurium cation [69]."
[142] "The proposal of first activation of the propane mol- ecules fits well with the mechanism type proposed in this paper for the other catalytic system."
[143] "The charge transfer is known to be energetically more favorable as the coordination of the oxide bound to the metal decreases and it may be proposed that the vanadium sites neigh- boring the empty heptagonal channels (M1, M3 or M7 crystallographic sites) could be the sites activating the alkane molecules."
[144] "This could explain the importance of the empty heptagonal channels that are specific to this active phase."
[145] "The charge transfer is localized at the vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi- conductor [70]."
[146] "The direct charge transfer proposed in Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O) sites at the surface of the M1 phase."
[147] "A recent study of the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge in the structure, Mo5+ were identified by EPR [71]."
[148] "This feature was explained by the existence of a substitution disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability of the configuration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in fig- ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation of a hole in the valence band."
[149] "Taking into account Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation: Mo6 Nb  O2 ! Mo5 Nb  O"
[150] "In the case of the M1 phase, despite the fact that one of the three bound cations is preferentially a niobium cation (the one occupying the center of the pentagonal channel [66]) one may hypothesize that the described redox dispropor- tion may also occur."
[151] "However this later pathway should likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a challenging yet promising area in heterogeneous catalysis, with a focus on developing efficient catalysts for the partial oxidation of light alkanes. Catalysts such as VPO or VSbO-based systems have been found to be particularly effective due to their unique mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that overcome the initial activation barrier. The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reactions arises from the multitude of possible reaction pathways and steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorption. Despite various proposed pathways, no single mechanism stands out as universally applicable. The goal is to propose a common activation site for several efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation. The first step in transforming an alkane molecule involves oxidative dehydrogenation. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes, involving sites with specific properties such as strong Bronsted acidity, strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O) or O2). These properties do not align with those required for efficient alkene oxidation, such as long-range electron delocalization and high electron mobility. The presence of these species in oxidation catalysts is related to structure defects like cations with different oxidation states or vacancies. Achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH processes is challenging due to the need for precise control over the reaction pathways and intermediates. The proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction, which collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, which are essential for the selective activation of alkanes.
