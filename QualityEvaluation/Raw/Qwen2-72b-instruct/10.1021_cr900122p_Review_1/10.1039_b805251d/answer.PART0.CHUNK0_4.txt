[7] "These effects of oxide surface density and domain size on catalytic function are illustrated first for the specific case of MoOx structures supported on Al2O3, but the general findings and conclusions remain valid for other supports and also for VOx and WOx domains."
[8] "The concurrent changes observed in absorption edge energies and in the stabilization of the transition state for CH bond cleavage and OH and CO bond formation reflect the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity."

[10] "For a given reactant (DE1, XH bond dissociation energy and H ionization energy,endothermic) and cluster (with protonation enthalpy DE3,exothermic), a lower lying LUMO (DE2) leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction (DHCH,abstr = DE1 + DE2 + DE3) and activation barrier (Eact,CH,abst) assuming an Evans-Polyani correlation of Eact,CH,abst and DHCH,abstr according to Eact,CH,abst = E0 + aDHCH,abstr,where E0 and a are constants."

1.Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, which can be measured by the effects of residence time on the formation rates of alkenes and COx. The catalytic turnovers for ODH of MoOx and VOx proceed through reduction-oxidation cycles, involving the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms. Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which activates the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms. The catalytic sequence requires transition states that introduce significant electron density into oxide domains during CH bond activation. The ability of oxide domains to accept electron density, which depends on the position of the LUMO, leads to significant catalytic consequences. These effects are illustrated using MoOx structures supported on Al2O3, but the findings are valid for other supports and VOx and WOx domains. Larger domains have increased ability to accept electrons, consistent with their lower lying LUMO states and higher electron affinity. These trends align with the linear free energy relationships between reaction enthalpies and activation energies commonly observed in oxidation catalysis. A lower lying LUMO leads to a more exothermic H abstraction reaction and activation barrier.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及初级和次级反应，可以通过停留时间对烯烃和COx形成速率的影响来测量。MoOx和VOx的ODH催化转化通过还原-氧化循环进行，涉及晶格氧原子的去除和替换。反应速率受还原步骤限制，该步骤在可还原氧化物域表面的晶格氧原子对上激活烷烃中最弱的CH键。催化序列需要在CH键激活过程中向氧化物域引入大量电子密度的过渡态。氧化物域接受电子密度的能力，这取决于LUMO的位置，可能导致显著的催化后果。这些效应通过在Al2O3上支撑的MoOx结构进行说明，但发现和结论对于其他支撑物以及VOx和WOx域同样有效。较大的域具有更强的接受电子的能力，与它们较低的LUMO状态和较高的电子亲和力一致。这些趋势与氧化催化中通常观察到的反应焓与活化能之间的线性自由能关系相吻合。较低的LUMO导致更放热的H抽象反应和活化能。
