[2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."

[5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
[6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

1.The study examined the effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence. This suggests that turnover rates are influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. The relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx, and other oxides suggest that factors such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields.

1.该研究通过使用支撑在ZrO2上的二维VOx，MoOx和WOx结构，考察了阳离子身份对氧化脱氢（ODH）途径的影响。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加，而相应的反应速率则按此顺序减少。这表明，这些金属氧化物的还原性影响了周转率。相对的丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧速率不仅取决于CH键能量差异，还取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓，这反映了参与氧化物表面上烯烃π键合的阳离子的Lewis酸性。观察到的丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间的活化能差异随阳离子的Lewis酸性增加（V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+）而增加。VOx，MoOx，WOx和其他氧化物之间的观察到的差异表明，烷烃和烯烃之间的吸附焓或熵的差异，以及活性氧化物和支撑物的酸碱性质，可能也会影响k3/k1比率和烯烃产量。然而，烷烃ODH反应中CH键的活化似乎需要与烯烃燃烧中涉及的CH键活化步骤相同的位点，这使得选择性中毒策略在提高烯烃产量方面无效。
