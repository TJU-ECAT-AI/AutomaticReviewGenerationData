[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
[2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
[4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
[6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
[7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
[8] "The activation energies (99126 kJ/mol) are similar to values previously reported on V2O5Nb2O5 (72110 kJ/mol), 36 and they increase in the sequence Propane ODH rates show the opposite trend and decrease in this order; this suggests that the higher ODH rates reported on VOx-based catalysts reflect the lower activation energy for CH bond activation on VOx-based catalysts compared to those on catalysts based on MoOx and WOx."
[9] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
[10] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2). This leads to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio (and an increase in propene yields) as temperature increases."
[11] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
[12] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
[13] "The Lewis acid strength of the cations increases in the sequence V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+."
[14] "The electron-rich π bond causes propene to interact more strongly with electron-deficient cations (or with less basic oxygens) than propane."
[15] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
[16] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
[17] "The activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases."
[18] "This difference in activation energy (4861 kJ/mol) is larger than the difference in bond dissociation enthalpy between the weakest CH bonds in propane and propene and it increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2,. This suggests that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also influence the relative reaction rates of these two molecules and that these adsorption effects depend on the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes was studied using VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The relative rates of propane ODH and propene combustion depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+). The differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The activation energies for propane ODH are similar to values previously reported and they increase in the sequence Propane ODH rates show the opposite trend and decrease in this order, suggesting that the higher ODH rates on VOx-based catalysts reflect the lower activation energy for CH bond activation compared to MoOx and WOx. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation on all three catalysts, leading to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio and an increase in propene yields as temperature increases. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The Lewis acid strength of the cations increases in the sequence V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. Propene interacts more strongly with electron-deficient cations than propane. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study. The activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion, leading to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases. The difference in activation energy between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than the difference in bond dissociation enthalpy between the weakest CH bonds in propane and propene, suggesting that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane influence the relative reaction rates and that these adsorption effects depend on the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces.

1.研究了使用支撑在ZrO2上的VOx，MoOx和WOx结构的烷氧化脱氢（ODH）。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加，而反应速率则按此顺序减少。丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧的相对速率不仅取决于CH键能差，还取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓，这反映了参与氧化物表面烯烃π键合的阳离子的Lewis酸性。丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间观察到的活化能差异随阳离子的Lewis酸性增加（V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+）而增加。VOx，MoOx，WOx和其他氧化物之间的差异表明，烷和烯烃之间的吸附焓或熵差，以及活性氧化物和支撑物的酸碱性质，也可能影响k3/k1比率和烯烃产率。烷ODH反应中CH键的活化需要与烯烃燃烧中CH键活化步骤相同的位点，使得选择性中毒策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。丙烯的较高反应性部分是由于丙烷中（亚甲基组）的最弱CH键明显强于丙烯中的烯丙基CH键。丙烷ODH的活化能与以前报道的值相似，并且按丙烷ODH速率与此顺序相反的趋势减少，表明VOx基催化剂上的较高ODH速率反映了与MoOx和WOx相比，CH键活化具有较低的活化能。丙烷ODH反应的表观活化能对应于步骤I的吸附焓和步骤II过渡态物种形成焓的总和。丙烯燃烧的表观活化能低于所有三种催化剂上的丙烯脱氢，导致k3/k1比率随温度升高而降低，丙烯产率增加。ΔE1  ΔE3的值强烈影响k3/k1比率。阳离子的Lewis酸性按V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+的顺序增加。丙烯比丙烷与电子不足的阳离子更强地相互作用。测量的ΔE1  ΔE3值按V5+，Mo6+和W6+阳离子预测的Lewis酸性的相同顺序增加。金属中心的还原性和活性晶格氧物种的基本性似乎解释了本研究中获得的催化活性序列（VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2）。丙烷ODH的活化能高于丙烯燃烧，导致反应温度升高时k3/k1比率降低。丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间的活化能差大于丙烷和丙烯中最弱CH键之间的键解离焓差，并且按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加，这表明丙烯和丙烷的相对吸附焓也影响这两种分子的相对反应速率，而这些吸附效应取决于参与氧化物表面烯烃π键合的阳离子的Lewis酸性。
