[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
[2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[3] "Propane ODH activation energies are higher than for propene combustion."
[4] "This difference in activation energy (4861 kJ/mol) between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than between bond dissociation enthalpies for the weakest CH bond in propane and propene (40 kJ/mol) and it increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2."
[5] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
[6] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[7] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
[8] "A recent literature survey of product yields in oxidation reactions23 suggested that low yields are obtained when the energy of the weakest bond in the products is 3040 kJ/mol lower than that of the weakest bond in the reactants."
[9] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1).1 Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."
[10] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene.23"
[11] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."

1.The study examined the effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, with corresponding reaction rates decreasing in the same sequence. Propane ODH activation energies are higher than for propene combustion, and the difference in activation energy between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than the difference in bond dissociation enthalpies for the weakest CH bond in propane and propene. This difference increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. The results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend on CH bond energy differences and the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, reflecting the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions requires the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. Low yields are obtained when the energy of the weakest bond in the products is 3040 kJ/mol lower than that of the weakest bond in the reactants. The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps, with alkenes as primary ODH products and CO and CO2 forming via secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. Differences among VOx, MoOx, WOx, and other oxides suggest that factors such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acidbase properties of active oxides and supports, may influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields.

1.研究考察了不同阳离子对氧化脱氢（ODH）路径的影响，使用了在ZrO2上支撑的二维VOx、MoOx和WOx结构。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加，相应的反应速率也按相同顺序减少。丙烷ODH的活化能高于丙烯燃烧，丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间的活化能差异大于丙烷和丙烯中最弱的CH键的键解离焓的差异。这一差异按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加。结果表明，丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧的相对速率不仅取决于CH键能量差异，还取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓，这反映了参与在氧化物表面上与烯烃π键合的阳离子的Lewis酸性。丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间的观察到的活化能差异随阳离子的Lewis酸性的增加而增加。烷烃ODH反应中CH键的活化需要与烯烃燃烧中涉及的CH键活化步骤相同的位点，这使得选择性中毒策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。当产物中最弱的键的能量比反应物中最弱的键低3040 kJ/mol时，会得到低产率。轻烷烃氧化为烯烃通过平行和连续的氧化步骤进行，烯烃是主要的ODH产物，而CO和CO2（COx）可以通过烯烃的二次燃烧或烷烃的直接燃烧形成。丙烯的更高反应性部分是因为丙烷中（亚甲基组）的最弱CH键明显强于丙烯中的烯丙基CH键。VOx、MoOx、WOx和其他氧化物之间的差异表明，其他因素，如烷烃和烯烃之间的吸附焓或熵的差异，以及因此活性氧化物和支撑物的酸碱性质，也可能影响k3/k1比率和烯烃产率。
