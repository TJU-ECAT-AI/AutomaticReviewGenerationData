[1] "The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2."
[2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides."
[3] "These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces."
[4] "The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+)."
[5] "The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acidbase properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields."
[6] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."
[7] "The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest CH bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene."
[8] "The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1."
[9] "The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures."
[10] "The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7)."
[11] "The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2)."
[12] "The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12)."
[13] "The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations."
[14] "The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5)."
[15] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

1.The study examined the effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the reaction rates decrease in this sequence. This suggests that turnover rates are influenced by the reducibility of the metal oxides. The relative rates of propane ODH and propene combustion depend on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases. The differences among VOx, MoOx, WOx, and other oxides suggest that factors such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and the acid-base properties of active oxides and supports, may influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields. The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. The greater reactivity of propene arises because the weakest CH bond in propane is stronger than the allylic CH bond in propene. The limited kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides suggests a similar mechanism. The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 indicate that propane ODH and propene combustion pathways involve transition states with different structures. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species. The apparent activation energy for propene combustion is lower than for propene dehydrogenation on all three catalysts. The value of ΔE1  ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios. The measured ΔE1  ΔE3 values increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study. Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility are essential requirements for selective ODH, consistent with the trends in ODH rates and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts.

1.本研究通过使用支撑在ZrO2上的二维VOx，MoOx和WOx结构，考察了阳离子身份对氧化脱氢（ODH）途径的影响。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2的顺序增加，而反应速率则按此顺序减少。这表明，金属氧化物的还原性影响了周转率。丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧的相对速率不仅取决于CH键能差，还取决于丙烯和丙烷的吸附焓，这反映了参与烯烃在氧化物表面π键合的阳离子的Lewis酸性。观察到的丙烷ODH和丙烯燃烧之间的活化能差异随阳离子Lewis酸性的增加而增加。VOx，MoOx，WOx和其他氧化物之间的差异表明，烷烃和烯烃之间的吸附焓或熵的差异，以及活性氧化物和支撑物的酸碱性质，可能影响k3/k1比率和烯烃产率。然而，烷烃ODH反应中CH键的活化似乎需要与烯烃燃烧中涉及的CH键活化步骤相同的位点，这使得选择性中毒策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。丙烯的较高反应性部分是因为丙烷中（亚甲基组）的最弱CH键明显强于丙烯中的烯丙基CH键。有限的可用动力学数据不允许对WOx/ZrO2上的ODH机制进行结论性评估，但Mo和WOx之间的化学相似性表明反应也通过导致eq 1的步骤进行。反应1和3的相似位点要求（由VOx结构对选择性的影响所暗示）和ΔS3和ΔS1的显著不同值表明，丙烷ODH（反应1）和丙烯燃烧（反应3）途径涉及具有不同结构的过渡态。丙烷ODH反应的表观活化能对应于步骤I的吸附焓和步骤II中过渡态物种形成焓的总和。丙烯燃烧的表观活化能（ΔE3）在所有三种催化剂上都低于丙烯脱氢。ΔE1  ΔE3的值强烈影响k3/k1比率。测量的ΔE1  ΔE3值（表2）确实按预测的V5+，Mo6+和W6+阳离子Lewis酸强度的相同顺序增加。金属中心的还原性和活性晶格氧物种的基本性似乎可以解释本研究中获得的催化活性序列（VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2）。中间还原性，弱Lewis酸中心和高氧流动性是选择性ODH的基本要求；它们与在VOx，MoOx和WOx基催化剂上观察到的ODH速率和k2/k1和k3/k1比率的趋势一致。
