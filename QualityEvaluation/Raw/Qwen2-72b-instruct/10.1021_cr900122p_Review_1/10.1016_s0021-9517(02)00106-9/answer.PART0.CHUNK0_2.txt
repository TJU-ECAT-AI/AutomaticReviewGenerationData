1.The literature does not provide specific details on the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), the interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, the proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. However, it does mention that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH, and that the use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method can lead to the production of catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities, which can improve performance in heterogeneous processes. Site isolation is mentioned as a strategy to introduce isolated catalytic centers onto the surface of an oxide support, which can lead to improved control over the structure of the catalytic site and the generation of site-isolated catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的具体细节，各种催化剂之间的相互作用，实现高选择性和转化率的挑战，提出的反应机理，或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中所起的作用。但是，它确实提到基于钒的催化剂通常在丙烷ODH中优于其他含金属的催化剂，并且使用热解分子前体(TMP)方法可以产生具有高表面积和均匀性的催化剂，这可以改善在异相过程中的性能。位点隔离被提到是一种将孤立的催化中心引入到氧化物支持物表面的策略，这可以导致对催化位点结构的改进控制和位点隔离催化剂的生成。
