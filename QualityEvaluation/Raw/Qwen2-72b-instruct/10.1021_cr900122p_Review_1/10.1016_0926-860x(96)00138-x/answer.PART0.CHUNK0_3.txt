[1] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
[2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
[3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
[4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
[5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
[7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
[8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
[9] "Other mechanistic schemes can be envisaged."
[10] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
[11] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
[12] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
[13] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
[14] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
[15] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."

1.The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction to the acid-base nature and strength of the catalyst varies between the routes to propylene and COx. The C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the alkyl desorption route, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. Propane oxidation over V-containing catalysts is initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface. Heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond has also been proposed, with acidic catalysts favoring the formation of a cation and basic catalysts favoring the formation of a carbanion. Redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface, regardless of the initial mode of activation. Other mechanistic schemes can be considered, such as a concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and forming, where the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in a single step. Another activation mode involves the adsorption of propane as alkoxy species, with the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond. The alkoxy species decomposes to propylene, requiring the presence of BrSnsted acid sites. This alkoxy route is supported by in-situ FT-IR studies showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediates to propylene during propane oxidation over CrMoO catalysts.

1.丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯可能需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如Moro-oka和Ueda在MoMgO催化剂上所展示的。对于丙烯和COx的生成路径，反应对催化剂的酸碱性质和强度的敏感性不同。C-H键断裂被认为具有均裂性，产生丙基自由基。高温有利于烷基的解吸路径，而低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应。V含催化剂上的丙烷氧化在气相中开始，在催化剂表面完成。C-H键的异裂也已被提出，酸性催化剂倾向于形成阳离子，而碱性催化剂倾向于形成碳负离子。无论初始激活模式如何，催化剂表面都存在氧化还原平衡。可以考虑其他机制方案，例如涉及同时断裂和形成键的协同机制，其中催化剂的酸碱和氧化还原性质作为一个整体在单一步骤中发挥作用。另一种丙烷活化模式涉及其作为醇氧物种的吸附，即直接将晶格氧原子插入C-H键中。醇氧物种分解为丙烯，需要BrSnsted酸位点的存在。这一醇氧路径得到了原位FT-IR研究的支持，这些研究显示在CrMoO催化剂上丙烷氧化过程中形成了丙氧基表面物种作为丙烯的中间体。
