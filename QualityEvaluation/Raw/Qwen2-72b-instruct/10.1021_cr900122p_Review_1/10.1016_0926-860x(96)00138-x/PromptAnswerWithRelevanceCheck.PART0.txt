1.The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by Moro-oka and Ueda for the MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the routes to propylene and COx to the acid-base nature and strength of the catalyst is different. The C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the alkyl desorption route, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds is considered. Another mode of activation of propane is its adsorption as alkoxy species, which decomposes to propylene, needing the presence of BrSnsted acid sites.

1.选择性氧化至丙烯可能还需要BrSnsted酸位点，这在Moro-oka和Ueda对MoMgO催化剂的研究中得到了展示。丙烯和COx的路线对催化剂的酸碱性质和强度的敏感性不同。C-H键的断裂被认为是均裂的，产生丙基自由基。高温有利于烷基脱附途径，而低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应途径。考虑了一个涉及同时断裂和形成化学键的协同机制。丙烷的另一种活化模式是其作为醇氧物种的吸附，即直接将晶格氧原子插入C-H键中，然后分解为丙烯，需要BrSnsted酸位点的存在。
2.各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战以及提出的反应机制共同影响过程效率。位点隔离通过控制反应途径和防止不希望的产品的形成，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant, as the process often leads to the formation of multiple products, such as acetone and acetic acid, alongside the desired acrolein. The proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, as the selectivity and conversion rates are determined by the catalyst's ability to control the reaction pathways. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The role of water and Brinsted acid sites is also important in determining the selectivity of the expected products. The success of obtaining maleic anhydride directly from n-butane has encouraged further studies in this area. The reaction mechanisms involve the formation of allylic species, followed by redox and acid-base steps, with the interconversion between w and o- species being reversible. The role of phosphorous in increasing catalyst surface acidity serves to promote allylic oxidation over oxyhydration. The nature of the active sites in VMgO catalysts is still under debate, but the reducibility of the catalyst plays a significant role in the reaction course, particularly in the activation of propane. The basic catalyst surface increases the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes, and the different steps of the routes to propylene and COx are differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst. The selective route to propylene involves the breaking of the second C-H bond of the propyl species, while the oxygenates route involves the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl intermediate. The surface reactivity of propylene produced is also a factor in determining selectivity.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战是显著的，因为该过程通常会导致形成多种产品，如丙酮和乙酸，以及所需的丙烯醛。提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提。这些因素共同影响过程效率，因为选择性和转化率由催化剂控制反应路径的能力决定。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过防止通过二次反应形成不希望的产品。水和Brinsted酸位点的作用对于确定预期产品的选择性也很重要。直接从正丁烷获得马来酸酐的成功鼓励了这方面的进一步研究。反应机制涉及形成烯丙基物种，随后是氧化还原和酸碱步骤，w和o-物种之间的相互转化是可逆的。磷在增加催化剂表面酸性中的作用是促进烯丙基氧化而不是水合氧化。VMgO催化剂中活性位点的性质仍在争论中，但催化剂的还原性在反应过程中起着重要作用，特别是在丙烷的活化中。催化剂的基本表面在烷烃的ODHR中增加了烯烃的选择性，而丙烯和COx路线的不同步骤对所用催化剂的酸碱性质和强度的敏感性不同。选择性丙烯路线涉及丙基物种的第二个C-H键的断裂，而氧合物路线涉及表面氧原子在烷基中间体中的插入。产生的丙烯的表面反应性也是决定选择性的因素。

1.The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as suggested by recent studies on MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst can vary, affecting the selectivity and conversion rates. Homolytic C-H bond breaking leads to the formation of a propyl radical, while high temperatures favor alkyl desorption, and low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. Propane oxidation over vanadium-containing catalysts is initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface. Heterolytic C-H bond splitting has also been proposed, with acidic catalysts favoring cation formation and basic catalysts favoring carbanion formation. Redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface, regardless of the initial activation mode. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and forming may occur, where the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role in a single step. Propene can also be activated by adsorption as alkoxy species, requiring BrSnsted acid sites for decomposition to propylene. Site isolation can address selectivity issues by controlling the interaction between active sites and reactants, influencing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

However, it does discuss the selective oxidation of propane to valuable products such as propylene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid. The activation of propane is identified as the rate-determining step, and the overall process of selective oxidation of propane to organic products is less understood. Acid/oxidizing sites are required for C-H bond activation, and basic/nucleophilic sites are needed for proton abstraction or oxygen/nitrogen atom insertion. The exact structure of these sites is yet to be determined, but the intervention of acidic (oxidant) and basic (nucleophilic) pairs of sites is imperative for each elementary step. The electronic structure of the organic adsorbed species also plays a role in the involved elementary steps. The invoked elementary mechanisms and their number require a specific surface structure to obtain high selectivity in the overall oxidation process. Comparative studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation could be useful in understanding the process.

However, it does discuss the selective oxidation of propane and propylene, which involves similar processes. The selective oxidation of hydrocarbons depends on the acid-base properties and redox properties of the catalyst. The presence of acid-base sites is necessary for the activation of hydrocarbons, and the redox properties of the catalyst determine the selectivity of the reaction. The role of water is also discussed, which can act as a nucleophilic and oxidizing reactant in the reaction. The literature also mentions the importance of a good balance between the acid and basic surface properties of the catalyst for obtaining the desired product. The role of ammonia is also discussed, which can provide nucleophilic surface species that attack the carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to form acrylonitrile. The literature does not provide specific information on the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues, but it does suggest that a good mix of the acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface is necessary to obtain the desired product during the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons.

[6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
[7] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
[8] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B)."
[9] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene. This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."

1.The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed. Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

1.丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯可能需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如Moro-oka和Ueda在MoMgO催化剂上所展示的。反应路径对催化剂的酸碱性质的敏感性各不相同，C-H键断裂被认为具有同裂性，产生丙基自由基。高温有利于烷基物种的解吸，而低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应。还提出了一个涉及同时断裂和形成键的协同机制。从丙氧基物种的分解可以产生丙烯，这需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如MoMgO催化剂中丙烯形成与这种位点数量之间的相关性所显示的。这些因素共同影响烷烃氧化脱氢的效率，而位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着作用。
