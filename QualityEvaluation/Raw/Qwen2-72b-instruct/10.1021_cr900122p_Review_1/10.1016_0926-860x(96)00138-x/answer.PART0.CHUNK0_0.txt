1.The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by Moro-oka and Ueda for the MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the routes to propylene and COx to the acid-base nature and strength of the catalyst is different. The C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical. High temperatures favor the alkyl desorption route, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds is considered. Another mode of activation of propane is its adsorption as alkoxy species, which decomposes to propylene, needing the presence of BrSnsted acid sites.
2.The interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the reaction pathways and preventing the formation of undesired products.

1.选择性氧化至丙烯可能还需要BrSnsted酸位点，这在Moro-oka和Ueda对MoMgO催化剂的研究中得到了展示。丙烯和COx的路线对催化剂的酸碱性质和强度的敏感性不同。C-H键的断裂被认为是均裂的，产生丙基自由基。高温有利于烷基脱附途径，而低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应途径。考虑了一个涉及同时断裂和形成化学键的协同机制。丙烷的另一种活化模式是其作为醇氧物种的吸附，即直接将晶格氧原子插入C-H键中，然后分解为丙烯，需要BrSnsted酸位点的存在。
2.各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战以及提出的反应机制共同影响过程效率。位点隔离通过控制反应途径和防止不希望的产品的形成，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
