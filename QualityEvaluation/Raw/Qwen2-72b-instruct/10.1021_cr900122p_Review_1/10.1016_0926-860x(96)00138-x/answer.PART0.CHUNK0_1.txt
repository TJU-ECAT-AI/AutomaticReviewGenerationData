1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant, as the process often leads to the formation of multiple products, such as acetone and acetic acid, alongside the desired acrolein. The proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, as the selectivity and conversion rates are determined by the catalyst's ability to control the reaction pathways. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing the formation of undesired products through secondary reactions. The role of water and Brinsted acid sites is also important in determining the selectivity of the expected products. The success of obtaining maleic anhydride directly from n-butane has encouraged further studies in this area. The reaction mechanisms involve the formation of allylic species, followed by redox and acid-base steps, with the interconversion between w and o- species being reversible. The role of phosphorous in increasing catalyst surface acidity serves to promote allylic oxidation over oxyhydration. The nature of the active sites in VMgO catalysts is still under debate, but the reducibility of the catalyst plays a significant role in the reaction course, particularly in the activation of propane. The basic catalyst surface increases the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes, and the different steps of the routes to propylene and COx are differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst. The selective route to propylene involves the breaking of the second C-H bond of the propyl species, while the oxygenates route involves the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl intermediate. The surface reactivity of propylene produced is also a factor in determining selectivity.

1.烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。实现高选择性和转化率的挑战是显著的，因为该过程通常会导致形成多种产品，如丙酮和乙酸，以及所需的丙烯醛。提出的反应机制包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提。这些因素共同影响过程效率，因为选择性和转化率由催化剂控制反应路径的能力决定。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用，通过防止通过二次反应形成不希望的产品。水和Brinsted酸位点的作用对于确定预期产品的选择性也很重要。直接从正丁烷获得马来酸酐的成功鼓励了这方面的进一步研究。反应机制涉及形成烯丙基物种，随后是氧化还原和酸碱步骤，w和o-物种之间的相互转化是可逆的。磷在增加催化剂表面酸性中的作用是促进烯丙基氧化而不是水合氧化。VMgO催化剂中活性位点的性质仍在争论中，但催化剂的还原性在反应过程中起着重要作用，特别是在丙烷的活化中。催化剂的基本表面在烷烃的ODHR中增加了烯烃的选择性，而丙烯和COx路线的不同步骤对所用催化剂的酸碱性质和强度的敏感性不同。选择性丙烯路线涉及丙基物种的第二个C-H键的断裂，而氧合物路线涉及表面氧原子在烷基中间体中的插入。产生的丙烯的表面反应性也是决定选择性的因素。
