[1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
[2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
[3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
[4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
[5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
[6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
[7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
[8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
[9] "The position of these equilibria depends on the redox and acid-base properties of the catalyst and on the reactive atmosphere."
[10] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
[11] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
[12] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
[13] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
[14] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."

1.The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as suggested by recent studies on MoMgO catalysts. The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst can vary, affecting the selectivity and conversion rates. Homolytic C-H bond breaking leads to the formation of a propyl radical, while high temperatures favor alkyl desorption, and low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions. Propane oxidation over vanadium-containing catalysts is initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface. Heterolytic C-H bond splitting has also been proposed, with acidic catalysts favoring cation formation and basic catalysts favoring carbanion formation. Redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface, regardless of the initial activation mode. A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and forming may occur, where the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role in a single step. Propene can also be activated by adsorption as alkoxy species, requiring BrSnsted acid sites for decomposition to propylene. Site isolation can address selectivity issues by controlling the interaction between active sites and reactants, influencing the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1.丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯可能需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如最近对MoMgO催化剂的研究所暗示的。反应途径对催化剂酸碱性质的敏感性可能有所不同，影响选择性和转化率。同裂C-H键断裂导致丙基自由基的形成，而高温有利于烷基脱附，低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应。含钒催化剂上的丙烷氧化在气相中开始，在催化剂表面完成。也提出了异裂C-H键断裂，酸性催化剂有利于形成正离子，碱性催化剂有利于形成碳负离子。无论初始激活模式如何，催化剂表面都存在氧化还原平衡。一个协同机制可能涉及同时的键断裂和形成，其中催化剂的酸碱和氧化还原性质在单一步骤中发挥作用。丙烯也可以通过吸附为烷氧基物种来激活，需要BrSnsted酸位点分解为丙烯。位点隔离可以通过控制活性位点和反应物之间的相互作用来解决选择性问题，影响氧化脱氢过程的效率。
