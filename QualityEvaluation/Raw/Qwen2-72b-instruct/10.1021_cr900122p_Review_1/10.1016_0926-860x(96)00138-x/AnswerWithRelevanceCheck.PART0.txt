          [1] "The selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts."
          [2] "The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used catalyst."
          [3] "In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]."
          [4] "High temperature favors the alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]."
          [5] "So, propane oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas phase and completed on the catalyst surface."
          [6] "It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also proposed in the ODHR of propane."
          [7] "The former process should be expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic catalysts."
          [8] "In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activation as shown below:"
          [9] "A concerted mechanism (Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of chemical bonds."
          [10] "In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step."
          [11] "Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B):"
          [12] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene."
          [13] "This decomposition needs the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the MoMgO catalysts."
          [14] "The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of propane over CrMoO catalysts."
          [15] "The selective oxidation of propane to propylene may require BrSnsted acid sites, as demonstrated by Moro-oka and Ueda for MoMgO catalysts."
          [16] "The sensitivity of the reaction pathways to the acid-base properties of the catalyst varies, with C-H bond breaking believed to be homolytic, producing a propyl radical."
          [17] "High temperatures favor the desorption of alkyl species, while low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface reactions."
          [18] "A concerted mechanism involving simultaneous bond breaking and formation is also proposed."
          [19] "Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts."

Propene can be produced from the decomposition of alkoxy species, which requires BrSnsted acid sites, as shown by the correlation between propylene formation and the number of such sites in MoMgO catalysts. These factors collectively influence the efficiency of the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with site isolation playing a role in addressing selectivity issues.

          丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯可能需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如Moro-oka和Ueda在MoMgO催化剂上所展示的。反应路径对催化剂的酸碱性质的敏感性各不相同，C-H键断裂被认为具有同裂性，产生丙基自由基。高温有利于烷基物种的解吸，而低温和可还原催化剂促进表面反应。还提出了一个涉及同时断裂和形成键的协同机制。从丙氧基物种的分解可以产生丙烯，这需要BrSnsted酸位点，正如MoMgO催化剂中丙烯形成与这种位点数量之间的相关性所显示的。这些因素共同影响烷烃氧化脱氢的效率，而位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着作用。
