          The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products.

The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.

          烷烃的活化比相应的不饱和烃更困难，但它们的大量储备突显了其转化的经济利益。选择性转化石蜡烃为芳烃、不饱和烃或含氧或氮原子的有机分子是许多化学产品的来源。较低的烷烃是最不反应的碳氢化合物，这使它们得以保存至今。此外，它们的低反应性阻碍了它们在工业过程中的使用。直接将乙烷转化为C2-氧合烃的开发将提供一个有吸引力的替代方案。在反应条件下催化剂结构的转变及其对催化性能的影响被讨论，强调了开发和常规使用原位表征方法的必要性。石蜡烃的活化比其他烃更困难，因为前者具有较高的稳定性。因此，可能在激活石蜡烃所需的条件下，形成的产品容易被氧化，从而限制了选择性。烷烃的高稳定性是由于它们的电子结构。CH键的四面体排列保护了碳原子。CH键比烃的CC键更暴露，它们的断裂应该是大多数烃转化的第一步。CH键的键能对于初级碳最高，二级和三级碳上的CH键更反应性，C3烃通过这些位点被激活。激活烃分子的CH键的初始步骤需要烷烃和催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。烃与表面之间的亲和力促进了分子的活化。选择性也由烃催化剂的相互作用、催化剂的反应性和表面烃物种的稳定性决定。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体反应的速度。分子氧的活化需要可还原氧化物的存在。对于不可还原氧化物，掺杂剂的存在提供了它们活化的可还原位点。晶格氧的相对容易去除通常由催化剂用氢或烃还原的容易程度表征。使用N2O代替分子氧在C2-氧合物的形成中被证明更具选择性。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。通过EPR观察到了O生成物种与烷烃的反应。表面亲电性氧物种与非选择性氧化烃相关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。反应进料中存在水会降低转化率，增加对含氧物种的选择性。然而，水的存在对活性有显著影响。向进料中添加水会减少乙烯的形成，增加CO和乙醛的形成，但对CO2的形成没有影响。酸性支撑物（氧化铝）的存在也会增加活性，但程度小于可还原支撑物。较高的可还原性导致较高的TOF数，但反应条件下的氧化态与可还原性不对应。在分子氧存在下，对支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的支撑酸性对乙烷氧化的影响进行了探讨。酸碱性和氧化还原性都会影响乙烷的转化。位点隔离证明可以提高选择性。将铌酸盐添加到钒钛催化剂中会改变氧化还原性质，增加V2O5/TiO2催化剂的酸性；这会增加对乙烯的选择性。Te的存在促进了V5氧化态，而钯导致V4占95%。这可能解释了在用钯或Te掺杂后观察到的不同性能。已提出金属钯对H2的高亲和力解释了乙烯的高选择性。烃分子中C-H键的初始活化需要催化剂与烷烃和催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸/碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子氧化程度越高，与氧化离子的键越共价，从而增加氧化物的酸性。关于催化剂活性和还原性的联系，必须考虑到体相还原与表面还原以及还原分子性质的相关性，这导致了一些分歧。
