1.The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, which has preserved them over time and hindered their use in industrial processes. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, olefins, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate paraffins, thus limiting selectivity. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. Conversely, low valent cations result in a more electron-rich oxygen species, thus being more basic. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored by Le Bars et al. and Wan and coworkers. The higher activity of ZSM-5supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also related to the large amount of CO2 that may arise from over oxidation of partial oxidation products inside the microporous structure. The higher activity of VAPO-4 catalyst is also related to the higher ease of reoxidation. Both, acidbase and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the structure of supported vanadium oxide species it simply increases the surface density of vanadia sites. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by promoting the formation of isolated active sites that can selectively activate the C-H bond of alkanes, leading to higher selectivity and conversion. The interplay between various catalysts, the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms collectively influence the process efficiency.

1.烷烃的活化比相应的不饱和烃更困难，但其巨大的储量突出了其转化的经济利益。较低的烷烃是最不反应的烃，这在历史上保存了它们，并阻碍了它们在工业过程中的使用。选择性转化石蜡为芳烃、烯烃或含氧或氮原子的有机分子是许多化学产品的来源。直接转化乙烷为C2-氧合烃的发展将提供一个有吸引力的替代方案。在反应条件下催化剂结构的转变及其对催化性能的影响被讨论，强调了开发和常规使用原位表征方法的必要性。石蜡的活化比其他烃更困难，因为前者具有较高的稳定性。因此，形成的产物可能在激活石蜡所需的条件下容易氧化，从而限制了选择性。烷烃的高稳定性是由于它们的电子结构。CH键的四面体排列保护了碳原子。CH键比烃的CC键更暴露，它们的断裂应该是大多数烃转化的第一步。对于初级碳，CH键的能量最高，而二级和三级碳上的CH键更反应，C3烃通过这些位点被激活。烷烃的CH键与催化剂表面的初始活化需要烷烃与催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子氧化得越多，与氧化离子的键就越共价，从而增加了氧化物的酸性。相反，低价阳离子导致氧物种具有更丰富的电子，因此更碱性。烃与表面之间的亲和力促进了分子的活化。选择性也由烃催化剂的相互作用、催化剂的反应性和表面烃物种的稳定性决定。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体反应的速度。分子氧的活化需要可还原氧化物的存在。对于不可还原氧化物，掺杂剂的存在提供了可还原位点。晶格氧的相对容易去除通常由催化剂与氢或烃的还原容易程度表征。使用N2O代替分子氧已被证明在C2-氧合物的形成中更具选择性。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。表面亲电性氧物种的存在与烃的非选择性氧化有关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。酸性支撑（氧化铝）的存在也增加了活性，但程度小于可还原支撑。Le Bars等人和Wan等人探索了在分子氧存在下，支撑的钒氧化物催化剂在乙烷氧化中的支撑酸性效应。ZSM-5支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的较高活性也与微孔结构中部分氧化产物过度氧化产生的大量CO2有关。VAPO-4催化剂的较高活性也与较高的再氧化容易度有关。酸碱和氧化还原性质都会影响乙烷的转化。添加酸性铌酸盐对支撑的钒氧化物物种的结构没有影响，它只是增加了矾酸盐的表面密度。将铌酸盐添加到矾钛催化剂中会改变氧化还原性质并增加V2O5/TiO2催化剂的酸性；这增加了对乙烯的选择性。位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着至关重要的作用，通过促进形成孤立的活性位点，这些位点可以有选择性地活化烷烃的C-H键，从而导致更高的选择性和转化率。各种催化剂之间的相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战以及提出的反应机制（如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽象）共同影响过程效率。

The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The selectivity to alkenes in a series of catalysts depends on their basic character and on the specific hydrocarbon.

1.烷烃的活化比相应的烯烃更困难，但它们的大量储备突显了其转化的经济利益。选择性转化石蜡烃为芳烃、烯烃或含氧或氮原子的有机分子是许多化学产品的来源。直接将乙烷转化为C2-含氧烃的开发将提供一个有吸引力的替代方案。在反应条件下催化剂结构的转变及其对催化性能的影响被讨论，强调了开发和常规使用原位表征方法的必要性。较低的烷烃是最不反应的碳氢化合物，这使它们得以保存至今。此外，它们的低反应性阻碍了它们在工业过程中的应用。烯烃和烯烃衍生产品的使用正在稳步增加，它们的生产主要基于耗能密集的蒸汽裂解和FCC工艺。原料的反应性决定了它们的转化容易程度。烷烃的活化比其他碳氢化合物更困难，因为前者具有较高的稳定性。烷烃的高稳定性归因于它们的电子结构。CH键比碳碳键更暴露，它们的断裂应该是大多数碳氢化合物转化的第一步。CH键越强，所需的活化就越强，对于较低的烷烃，选择性氧化的最优反应温度与CH键的结合能之间存在相当线性的依赖关系。CH能量键对于初级碳最高，二级和三级碳上的CH键更反应性，C3烃通过这些位点被活化。然而，乙烷中的所有碳都是初级的，这使得它比其较大的同系物反应性低得多。乙烷中CH键的高解离能与其它分子中其它键的解离能相比，将影响可达到的最大选择性。烃分子中CH键的初始活化需要烷烃与催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子越氧化，与氧化物离子的键就越共价，从而增加了氧化物的酸性。一系列催化剂对烯烃的选择性取决于它们的基本特性和特定的烃。正丁烷的选择性按以下顺序增加：MgVAPO-5<VOx/ Al2O3<VAPO-5<VOx/MgOAl2O3<VOx/MgO；这与通过吡啶吸附确定的相对酸性降低相对应。这种趋势对于乙烷是相反的，而丙烷没有表现出特定的趋势。中等强度的酸性位点促进乙烷的ODH，而强酸性位点促进非选择性的COx物种的重要性已被报道。催化剂的性能也受到烃与催化剂的酸碱特性的影响。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体的反应速度。例如，在一些钙钛矿中存在非常高的氧流动性，这些钙钛矿是完全氧化的催化剂。相比之下，不可还原的氧化物的反应性要小得多，需要较高的反应温度。这些较高的反应温度导致气相自由基反应的显著贡献，据报道这促进了乙烷氧化期间的ODH产物。分子氧的活化需要可还原氧化物的存在。对于不可还原的氧化物，掺杂剂的存在提供了它们活化的可还原位点。晶格氧的去除相对容易通常由催化剂用氢或烃还原的容易程度来表征。一些报告显示，最选择性的催化剂的还原性较低，但有时这种趋势是相反的。然而，催化剂的还原性通常由体相还原确定，这可能与表面位点的还原不同。由于催化是一种表面现象，催化性能的数据应该与表面还原的参数相关联，而不是与体相还原的参数相关联。Valenzuela等人的一项有趣的工作指出了表面还原对乙烷ODH的相关性。活性与通过原位XPS测量确定的表面还原性相对应，但与通过TPR确定的体相还原性不相符。使用N2O代替分子氧已被证明在C2-含氧物的形成中更具选择性。这似乎是因为O物种在较低温度下与烷烃的活性较强，而分子氧下的活性较弱。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。O生成物种与烷烃的反应已被EPR观察到。N2O与催化剂的相互作用与O2不同，因为一氧化二氮在反应条件下不会完全重新氧化催化剂，当氧气或一氧化二氮用作乙烷ODH的氧化剂时，活化能是不同的。此外，N2O存在下的反应似乎较少受到催化剂红ox性质变化的影响。未掺杂和掺杂K的支撑氧化物在N2O下提供相似的乙烷转化率。相比之下，如果反应在O2下进行，添加K后活性显著降低，这与可还原位点对分子氧活化相关性预期一致。表面亲电性氧物种的存在与烃的非选择性氧化有关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。然而，在没有气相氧的情况下观察到乙烷的燃烧，氧化物是唯一的氧源，因为氧化物中氧的流动性是决定选择性的另一个因素。控制烃和中间体的活化和稳定性的因素也影响过程的活性和选择性。

1.The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves highlight the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, unsaturated hydrocarbons, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The activation of paraffins is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The stronger the CH bond is, the stronger the activation must be, and the dependence of the optimal reaction temperature for selective oxidation on the binding energy of the CH bond follows quite a linear trend for the lower alkanes. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarbon-catalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species. A strong acid-base interaction with the support may also promote further degradation of partial oxidation products. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. The selectivity and reducibility do not appear to show a clear trend. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation. The presence of water in the reaction feed decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen-containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The presence of large amounts of water must affect somehow the activation of N2O into O species. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation. The presence of an acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but oxidation state under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility. The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The former is related to the activation of the hydrocarbon, but the ability to activate oxygen (isotopic exchange) provides additional reactivity. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by promoting the formation of selective oxygen-containing products and preventing further degradation of partial oxidation products.

1.The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves underline the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, to unsaturated hydrocarbons or to organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative.
2.The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. Consequently, the maximum selectivity appears to be determined by the reaction, rather than by the catalyst. The activation of the hydrocarbon and of the oxidant, and the reactivity of lattice oxygen will determine how close the performance of catalyst is to optimal selectivity under conventional reaction conditions.
3.The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance, because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.
4.The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation.
5.The presence of water in the reaction feed, decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation.
6.The applicability of vanadium-based catalysts for ethane conversion are evident. The terminal metal-oxygen double bond has been proposed to be the active site for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. However, the bridging bond that must be invoked to account for this catalytic performance.
7.The oxygen species bridging surface vanadium oxide species to the support may play a significant role in catalyst activity. The nature of the VOS bond appears to be critical for the oxidation of ethane. The stability of the supported vanadium oxide catalyst is an important factor.
8.The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both, acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity.
9.The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the structure of supported vanadium oxide species. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene.
10.The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene.

2.烃分子中C-H键的初始活化需要催化剂与烷烃和催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸/碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子氧化程度越高，与氧化离子的键越共价，从而增加氧化物的酸性。因此，最大选择性似乎是由反应本身决定的，而不是由催化剂决定的。烃和氧化剂的活化以及晶格氧的反应性将决定催化剂在常规反应条件下的性能是否接近最优选择性。
3.烃与表面的亲和力促进了分子的活化。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体反应的速度。关于催化剂活性和还原性的联系，必须考虑到体相还原与表面还原以及还原分子性质的相关性，这导致了一些分歧。
4.使用N2O代替分子氧在C2-氧合物的形成中被证明更具选择性。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。通过EPR观察到了O生成物种与烷烃的反应。表面亲电性氧物种与非选择性氧化烃相关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。
5.反应进料中存在水会降低转化率，增加对含氧物种的选择性。然而，水的存在对活性有显著影响。向进料中添加水会减少乙烯的形成，增加CO和乙醛的形成，但对CO2的形成没有影响。
6.基于钒的催化剂对乙烷转化的适用性是显而易见的。终端金属-氧双键被提议为选择性氧化烃的活性位点。然而，必须调用桥接键来解释这种催化性能。
7.表面钒氧化物物种与支撑之间的桥接氧物种可能在催化剂活性中起重要作用。VOS键的性质似乎对乙烷的氧化至关重要。支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的稳定性是一个重要因素。
8.在分子氧存在下，对支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的支撑酸性对乙烷氧化的影响进行了探讨。酸碱性和氧化还原性都会影响乙烷的转化。位点隔离证明可以提高选择性。
9.添加酸性铌酸盐对支撑的钒氧化物物种的结构没有影响。将铌酸盐添加到钒钛催化剂中会改变氧化还原性质，增加V2O5/TiO2催化剂的酸性；这会增加对乙烯的选择性。
10.碲的存在促进了V5氧化态，而钯导致V4占95%。这可能解释了在用钯或碲掺杂后观察到的不同性能。已提出金属钯对H2的高亲和力解释了乙烯的高选择性。
