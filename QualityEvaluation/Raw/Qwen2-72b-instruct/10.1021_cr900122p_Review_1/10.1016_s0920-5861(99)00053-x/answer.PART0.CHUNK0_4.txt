1.The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding unsaturated hydrocarbons, but their large reserves underline the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, to unsaturated hydrocarbons or to organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative.
2.The initial activation of the C-H bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. Consequently, the maximum selectivity appears to be determined by the reaction, rather than by the catalyst. The activation of the hydrocarbon and of the oxidant, and the reactivity of lattice oxygen will determine how close the performance of catalyst is to optimal selectivity under conventional reaction conditions.
3.The affinity between the hydrocarbon and the surface promotes the activation of the molecules. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance, because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. The relevance of bulk reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the reducing molecule must account for some disagreements found when connecting the activity and reducibility of the catalysts.
4.The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation.
5.The presence of water in the reaction feed, decreases the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen containing species. The presence of water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity. The addition of water to the feed decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2 formation.
6.The applicability of vanadium-based catalysts for ethane conversion are evident. The terminal metal-oxygen double bond has been proposed to be the active site for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. However, the bridging bond that must be invoked to account for this catalytic performance.
7.The oxygen species bridging surface vanadium oxide species to the support may play a significant role in catalyst activity. The nature of the VOS bond appears to be critical for the oxidation of ethane. The stability of the supported vanadium oxide catalyst is an important factor.
8.The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been explored. Both, acid-base and redox properties affect the conversion of ethane. The site isolation proves to improve selectivity.
9.The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the structure of supported vanadium oxide species. The addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modifies the redox properties and increases the acidic properties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the selectivity to ethylene.
10.The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxidation state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may account for the different performances observed after doping with Pd or Te. It has been proposed that the high affinity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for the high selectivity of ethylene.

1.烷烃的活化比相应的不饱和烃更困难，但它们的大量储备突显了其转化的经济利益。选择性转化石蜡烃为芳烃、不饱和烃或含氧或氮原子的有机分子是许多化学产品的来源。较低的烷烃是最不反应的碳氢化合物，这使它们得以保存至今。此外，它们的低反应性阻碍了它们在工业过程中的使用。直接将乙烷转化为C2-氧合烃的开发将提供一个有吸引力的替代方案。
2.烃分子中C-H键的初始活化需要催化剂与烷烃和催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸/碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子氧化程度越高，与氧化离子的键越共价，从而增加氧化物的酸性。因此，最大选择性似乎是由反应本身决定的，而不是由催化剂决定的。烃和氧化剂的活化以及晶格氧的反应性将决定催化剂在常规反应条件下的性能是否接近最优选择性。
3.烃与表面的亲和力促进了分子的活化。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体反应的速度。关于催化剂活性和还原性的联系，必须考虑到体相还原与表面还原以及还原分子性质的相关性，这导致了一些分歧。
4.使用N2O代替分子氧在C2-氧合物的形成中被证明更具选择性。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。通过EPR观察到了O生成物种与烷烃的反应。表面亲电性氧物种与非选择性氧化烃相关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。
5.反应进料中存在水会降低转化率，增加对含氧物种的选择性。然而，水的存在对活性有显著影响。向进料中添加水会减少乙烯的形成，增加CO和乙醛的形成，但对CO2的形成没有影响。
6.基于钒的催化剂对乙烷转化的适用性是显而易见的。终端金属-氧双键被提议为选择性氧化烃的活性位点。然而，必须调用桥接键来解释这种催化性能。
7.表面钒氧化物物种与支撑之间的桥接氧物种可能在催化剂活性中起重要作用。VOS键的性质似乎对乙烷的氧化至关重要。支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的稳定性是一个重要因素。
8.在分子氧存在下，对支撑的钒氧化物催化剂的支撑酸性对乙烷氧化的影响进行了探讨。酸碱性和氧化还原性都会影响乙烷的转化。位点隔离证明可以提高选择性。
9.添加酸性铌酸盐对支撑的钒氧化物物种的结构没有影响。将铌酸盐添加到钒钛催化剂中会改变氧化还原性质，增加V2O5/TiO2催化剂的酸性；这会增加对乙烯的选择性。
10.碲的存在促进了V5氧化态，而钯导致V4占95%。这可能解释了在用钯或碲掺杂后观察到的不同性能。已提出金属钯对H2的高亲和力解释了乙烯的高选择性。
