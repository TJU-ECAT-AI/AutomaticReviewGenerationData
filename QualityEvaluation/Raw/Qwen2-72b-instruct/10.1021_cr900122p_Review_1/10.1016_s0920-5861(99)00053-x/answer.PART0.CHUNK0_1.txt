1.The activation of alkanes is more difficult than that of the corresponding alkenes, but their large reserves underline the economic interest in their conversion. The selective conversion of paraffins to aromatics, alkenes, or organic molecules containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many chemical products. The development of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydrocarbons would provide an attractive alternative. The transformation of catalyst structure under reaction conditions and its implications in catalytic performance are discussed, underlining the need for the development and routine use of in situ characterization methodologies. The lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and this has preserved them over time. Also, their low reactivity has hindered their use in industrial processes. The use of alkenes and alkene-derived products is steadily increasing and their production is mainly based on steam cracking and FCC processes, which are energy intensive. The reactivity of feedstocks determines their ease of conversion. The activation of alkanes is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The CH bonds are more exposed than the CC bonds of hydrocarbons and their cleavage should be the first step in the transformation of most hydrocarbons. The stronger the CH bond is the stronger the activation must be, and the dependence of the optimal reaction temperature for selective oxidation on the binding energy of the CH bond follows quite a linear trend for the lower alkanes. The CH energy bond is highest for primary carbons, CH bonds on secondary and tertiary carbons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are activated through these sites. However, all the carbons in ethane are primary, which makes it much less reactive than its larger homologues. The high dissociation energy of the CH bond of ethane vs. that of other bonds in other molecules will affect the maximum selectivity attainable. The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an affinity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The surface acid/base features of an oxide depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of the oxide. The selectivity to alkenes in a series of catalysts depends on their basic character and on the specific hydrocarbon. N-butane increases its selectivity in the order MgVAPO-5<VOx/ Al2O3<VAPO-5<VOx/MgOAl2O3<VOx/MgO; corresponding to a decrease in relative acidity, as determined by pyridine adsorption. This trend is reversed for ethane, while propane shows no specific trend at all. The importance of the strength of acid sites has been reported since moderately acid sites promote the selective ODH of ethane, whereas strong acid sites promote non-selective COx species. The performance of the catalyst is also affected by the acid-base characteristics of the hydrocarbon vs. that of the catalyst. The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react. For instance, very high oxygen mobility is present in total oxidation catalysts, such as some perovskites. By contrast, non-reducible oxides are much less reactive and require high reaction temperatures. These high reaction temperatures result in a significant contribution of the gas-phase radical reaction and this is reported to promote ODH products during ethane oxidation. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation. The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less reducible although sometimes this trend is reversed. However, catalyst reducibility is often determined by bulk reduction, which may differ from that of the surface sites.

The activity corresponds to the surface reducibility determined by in situ XPS measurements, but not with bulk reducibility, determined by TPR. The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-oxygenates. This appears to be due to the strong activity of O species with alkanes at lower temperatures than under molecular oxygen. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to stabilize oxygen ions. The reaction of O generated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR. The interaction of N2O with the catalyst is different to O2 since nitrous oxide does not fully reoxidize the catalyst under reaction conditions and the activation energy is different when oxygen or nitrous oxide are used as oxidants for ODH of ethane. Additionally, the reaction in the presence of N2O appears to be less affected by the modification of the redox properties of the catalyst. Supported-oxides, undoped and doped with K, afford similar conversions of ethane under N2O. Conversely, the activity decreases remarkably upon the addition of K if the reaction in run under O2, as expected from the relevance of reducible sites for the activation of molecular oxygen.

1.烷烃的活化比相应的烯烃更困难，但它们的大量储备突显了其转化的经济利益。选择性转化石蜡烃为芳烃、烯烃或含氧或氮原子的有机分子是许多化学产品的来源。直接将乙烷转化为C2-含氧烃的开发将提供一个有吸引力的替代方案。在反应条件下催化剂结构的转变及其对催化性能的影响被讨论，强调了开发和常规使用原位表征方法的必要性。较低的烷烃是最不反应的碳氢化合物，这使它们得以保存至今。此外，它们的低反应性阻碍了它们在工业过程中的应用。烯烃和烯烃衍生产品的使用正在稳步增加，它们的生产主要基于耗能密集的蒸汽裂解和FCC工艺。原料的反应性决定了它们的转化容易程度。烷烃的活化比其他碳氢化合物更困难，因为前者具有较高的稳定性。烷烃的高稳定性归因于它们的电子结构。CH键比碳碳键更暴露，它们的断裂应该是大多数碳氢化合物转化的第一步。CH键越强，所需的活化就越强，对于较低的烷烃，选择性氧化的最优反应温度与CH键的结合能之间存在相当线性的依赖关系。CH能量键对于初级碳最高，二级和三级碳上的CH键更反应性，C3烃通过这些位点被活化。然而，乙烷中的所有碳都是初级的，这使得它比其较大的同系物反应性低得多。乙烷中CH键的高解离能与其它分子中其它键的解离能相比，将影响可达到的最大选择性。烃分子中CH键的初始活化需要烷烃与催化剂表面之间存在亲和力。氧化物的表面酸碱特性取决于阳离子的电荷和半径。阳离子越氧化，与氧化物离子的键就越共价，从而增加了氧化物的酸性。一系列催化剂对烯烃的选择性取决于它们的基本特性和特定的烃。正丁烷的选择性按以下顺序增加：MgVAPO-5<VOx/ Al2O3<VAPO-5<VOx/MgOAl2O3<VOx/MgO；这与通过吡啶吸附确定的相对酸性降低相对应。这种趋势对于乙烷是相反的，而丙烷没有表现出特定的趋势。中等强度的酸性位点促进乙烷的ODH，而强酸性位点促进非选择性的COx物种的重要性已被报道。催化剂的性能也受到烃与催化剂的酸碱特性的影响。催化剂的反应性也很重要，因为它决定了表面中间体的反应速度。例如，在一些钙钛矿中存在非常高的氧流动性，这些钙钛矿是完全氧化的催化剂。相比之下，不可还原的氧化物的反应性要小得多，需要较高的反应温度。这些较高的反应温度导致气相自由基反应的显著贡献，据报道这促进了乙烷氧化期间的ODH产物。分子氧的活化需要可还原氧化物的存在。对于不可还原的氧化物，掺杂剂的存在提供了它们活化的可还原位点。晶格氧的去除相对容易通常由催化剂用氢或烃还原的容易程度来表征。一些报告显示，最选择性的催化剂的还原性较低，但有时这种趋势是相反的。然而，催化剂的还原性通常由体相还原确定，这可能与表面位点的还原不同。由于催化是一种表面现象，催化性能的数据应该与表面还原的参数相关联，而不是与体相还原的参数相关联。Valenzuela等人的一项有趣的工作指出了表面还原对乙烷ODH的相关性。活性与通过原位XPS测量确定的表面还原性相对应，但与通过TPR确定的体相还原性不相符。使用N2O代替分子氧已被证明在C2-含氧物的形成中更具选择性。这似乎是因为O物种在较低温度下与烷烃的活性较强，而分子氧下的活性较弱。N2O的活化似乎与氧化物进行电子转移以稳定氧离子的能力有关。O生成物种与烷烃的反应已被EPR观察到。N2O与催化剂的相互作用与O2不同，因为一氧化二氮在反应条件下不会完全重新氧化催化剂，当氧气或一氧化二氮用作乙烷ODH的氧化剂时，活化能是不同的。此外，N2O存在下的反应似乎较少受到催化剂红ox性质变化的影响。未掺杂和掺杂K的支撑氧化物在N2O下提供相似的乙烷转化率。相比之下，如果反应在O2下进行，添加K后活性显著降低，这与可还原位点对分子氧活化相关性预期一致。表面亲电性氧物种的存在与烃的非选择性氧化有关，而亲核性氧物种促进选择性氧化。然而，在没有气相氧的情况下观察到乙烷的燃烧，氧化物是唯一的氧源，因为氧化物中氧的流动性是决定选择性的另一个因素。控制烃和中间体的活化和稳定性的因素也影响过程的活性和选择性。
