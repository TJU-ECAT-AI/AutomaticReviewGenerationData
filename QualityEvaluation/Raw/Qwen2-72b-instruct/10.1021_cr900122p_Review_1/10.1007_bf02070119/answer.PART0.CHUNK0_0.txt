[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "In particular, copper(II) ion pairs (D) can be formed from one copper(II) ion, reducible by hydrogen,and another one corresponding to substitutional surface sites (AI), which remains stable towards hydrogen."
[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
[4] "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
[5] "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
[6] "The selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
[7] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
[8] "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[9] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
[10] "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受各种催化剂的影响，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。CuTh氧化物催化剂，具有不同的Cu/Th原子比，已通过EPR技术进行了广泛研究，揭示了铜(II)离子对和替代表面位点的存在。对于ODH，随着thoria中铜浓度的增加，催化活性增加，而乙烯和丙烯的选择性随着铜含量的变化，在特定比例达到峰值后下降。乙烷的转化在较高铜含量下更为显著，表明CuO晶体的作用，可能抑制乙烯的形成。乙烯的选择性与由特定信号表征的铜(II)位点相关。对于丙烷，催化活性归因于固体表面上的Cu 2+ 离子，而丙烯的选择性归因于替代位点的Cu 2+ 离子。这些因素共同影响过程效率，位点隔离在通过控制活性位点的分布和性质来解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。
