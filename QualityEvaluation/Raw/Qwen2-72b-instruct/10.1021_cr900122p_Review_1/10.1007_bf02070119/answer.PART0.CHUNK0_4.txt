[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
[3] "The conversion of ethane and propane to ethylene and propene, respectively, is closely correlated with the presence of copper in thoria."
[4] "At low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.i),the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are more important compared to those obtained in the case of ethane."
[5] "Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu 2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and Cue crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."
[6] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
[7] "Therefore, the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[8] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
[9] "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The activity and selectivity of CuTh oxide catalysts in ODH change with the nature of the alkane and the copper concentration. At low copper contents, the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are higher than those for ethane. The presence of Cu 2+ ions in different forms on the thoria surface, such as monomers and dimers, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The formation of CuO crystallites at high copper contents inhibits the formation of ethylene but may enhance the conversion of propane. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals, while the selectivity in propene is attributed to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites. Site isolation is crucial for addressing selectivity issues, as it affects the distribution of copper species and their reactivity towards the alkane substrates.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受各种催化剂的影响，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。CuTh氧化物催化剂在ODH中的活性和选择性随烷烃的性质和铜浓度的变化而变化。在低铜含量下，丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性高于乙烷。ThO2表面上Cu 2+ 离子的不同形式，如单体和二聚体，在反应机理中起着关键作用。高铜含量下CuO晶粒的形成抑制了乙烯的形成，但可能增强丙烷的转化。乙烯的选择性与特定信号表征的铜（II）位点相关，而丙烯的选择性归因于位于替代位点的Cu 2+ 离子。位点隔离对于解决选择性问题至关重要，因为它影响铜物种的分布及其对烷烃底物的反应性。
