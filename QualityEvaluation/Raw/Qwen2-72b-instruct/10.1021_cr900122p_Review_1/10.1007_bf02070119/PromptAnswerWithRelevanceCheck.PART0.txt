Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "In particular, copper(II) ion pairs (D) can be formed from one copper(II) ion, reducible by hydrogen,and another one corresponding to substitutional surface sites (AI), which remains stable towards hydrogen."
[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
[4] "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
[5] "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
[6] "The selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
[7] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."
[8] "Consequently,the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[9] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface (MI, M 2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."
[10] "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The CuTh oxide catalysts, with different Cu/Th atomic ratios, have been studied extensively using EPR technique, revealing the presence of copper(II) ion pairs and substitutional surface sites. The catalytic activity for ODH increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene and propene changes with the copper content, peaking at specific ratios before decreasing. The conversion of ethane is more significant at higher copper contents, suggesting the role of CuO crystallites, which may inhibit the formation of ethylene. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals. For propane, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu 2+ ions on the solid surface, while the selectivity in propene is due to Cu 2+ ions in substitutional sites. These factors collectively influence the process efficiency, with site isolation playing a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受各种催化剂的影响，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。CuTh氧化物催化剂，具有不同的Cu/Th原子比，已通过EPR技术进行了广泛研究，揭示了铜(II)离子对和替代表面位点的存在。对于ODH，随着thoria中铜浓度的增加，催化活性增加，而乙烯和丙烯的选择性随着铜含量的变化，在特定比例达到峰值后下降。乙烷的转化在较高铜含量下更为显著，表明CuO晶体的作用，可能抑制乙烯的形成。乙烯的选择性与由特定信号表征的铜(II)位点相关。对于丙烷，催化活性归因于固体表面上的Cu 2+ 离子，而丙烯的选择性归因于替代位点的Cu 2+ 离子。这些因素共同影响过程效率，位点隔离在通过控制活性位点的分布和性质来解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, with copper-thorium oxide catalysts showing activity and selectivity in the formation of ethene and propene. The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content but decreases for high Cu/Th ratios. The conversion of propane is closely correlated with the copper concentration in thoria when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25, and the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1. The selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals, while the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites rather than other sites.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）受催化剂性质的影响，铜-钍氧化物催化剂在乙烯和丙烯的形成中显示出活性和选择性。催化活性随铜在钍酸盐中的浓度增加而增加，而乙烯的选择性随铜含量的增加而增加，但在高Cu/Th比时下降。丙烷的转化率与铜在钍酸盐中的浓度密切相关，当Cu/Th原子比小于0.25时，丙烯的选择性迅速增加，达到Cu/Th=0.1时达到最大值。乙烯的选择性可以与由特定信号表征的铜（II）位点相关联，而丙烯的选择性可能是由于铜2+离子在替代位点的局部化，而不是其他位点。位点隔离通过控制催化剂表面铜离子的分布，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
