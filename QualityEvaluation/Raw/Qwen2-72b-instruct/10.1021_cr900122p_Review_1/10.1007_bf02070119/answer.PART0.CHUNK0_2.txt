[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
[3] "The conversion of ethane and propane to ethylene and propene, respectively, is closely correlated with the presence of copper in thoria."
[4] "At low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.i),the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are more important compared to those obtained in the case of ethane."
[5] "Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu 2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and Cue crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."
[6] "The selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[7] "The selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. The activity and selectivity of CuTh oxide catalysts in the ODH of ethane and propane are closely related to the copper content. At low copper contents, the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are higher than those for ethane. The Cu 2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms, including monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface. The selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals, while the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution of copper ions on the catalyst surface.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受各种催化剂的影响，包括金属氧化物和支撑系统。CuTh氧化物催化剂在乙烷和丙烷ODH中的活性和选择性与铜含量密切相关。在低铜含量下，丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性高于乙烷。在二氧化钍中，Cu 2+ 离子以不同的形式存在，包括固体表面的单体和由替代位点的铜和表面铜形成的二聚体。乙烯的选择性与特定信号表征的铜（II）位点相关，而丙烯的选择性可能是由于替代位点的Cu 2+ 离子。位点隔离通过控制催化剂表面铜离子的分布，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
