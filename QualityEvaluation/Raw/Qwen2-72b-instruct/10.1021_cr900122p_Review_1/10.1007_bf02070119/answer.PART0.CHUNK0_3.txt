[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]."
[2] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2)."
[3] "On the other side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content and decreases for Cu/Th > 0.25."
[4] "The conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."
[5] "the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and finally decreases for higher atomic ratios."
[6] "the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by MI, M 2 and D signals."
[7] "the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 1 and A 2) rather than other sites."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by the nature of the catalyst, with copper-thorium oxide catalysts showing activity and selectivity in the formation of ethene and propene. The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria, while the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper content but decreases for high Cu/Th ratios. The conversion of propane is closely correlated with the copper concentration in thoria when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25, and the selectivity in propene increases rapidly with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1. The selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by specific signals, while the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu 2+ ions localized in substitutional sites rather than other sites. Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution of copper ions on the catalyst surface.

1.烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）受催化剂性质的影响，铜-钍氧化物催化剂在乙烯和丙烯的形成中显示出活性和选择性。催化活性随铜在钍酸盐中的浓度增加而增加，而乙烯的选择性随铜含量的增加而增加，但在高Cu/Th比时下降。丙烷的转化率与铜在钍酸盐中的浓度密切相关，当Cu/Th原子比小于0.25时，丙烯的选择性迅速增加，达到Cu/Th=0.1时达到最大值。乙烯的选择性可以与由特定信号表征的铜（II）位点相关联，而丙烯的选择性可能是由于铜2+离子在替代位点的局部化，而不是其他位点。位点隔离通过控制催化剂表面铜离子的分布，在解决选择性问题中发挥作用。
