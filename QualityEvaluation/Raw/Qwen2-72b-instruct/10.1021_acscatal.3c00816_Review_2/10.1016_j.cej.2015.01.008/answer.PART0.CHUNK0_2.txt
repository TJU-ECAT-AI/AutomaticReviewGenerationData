1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite, which has an MFI topology, is used as a support for platinum catalysts in PDH due to its unique physical properties, such as a special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio. These properties make ZSM-5 an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in PDH reactions. The literature also notes that the capacity of catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolite to accommodate coke is much better than that of γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, possibly due to the relatively large surface area and particular channel character of ZSM-5. The introduction of metal promoters, such as zinc, has also been confirmed as an effective method to improve the reaction selectivity and stability of PDH catalysts. The way in which the promoter is added can influence the final properties of the support and metallic phases. For instance, the incorporation of zinc into the structure of microporous molecular sieve (ZSM-5) can create new active centers and result in different catalytic behavior compared to traditional preparation methods. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the structural characteristics and other factors that contribute to the effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH catalysts, nor does it address the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1.文献没有详细分析金属沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZSM-5沸石，具有MFI拓扑结构，由于其独特的物理性质，如特殊的三维通道和可调的Si-Al比，被用作PDH中铂催化剂的载体。这些性质使ZSM-5成为PDH反应中催化剂载体应用的有趣材料。文献还指出，支持在ZSM-5沸石上的催化剂容纳焦炭的能力远优于支持在γ-Al2O3上的催化剂，这可能是因为ZSM-5的相对较大的表面积和特殊的通道特性。引入金属促进剂，如锌，也被证实是提高PDH催化剂反应选择性和稳定性的有效方法。促进剂的添加方式可以影响支撑材料和金属相的最终性质。例如，将锌掺入微孔分子筛(ZSM-5)的结构中可以创建新的活性中心，并导致与传统制备方法不同的催化行为。然而，文献没有全面讨论MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH催化剂中的结构特征和其他因素，也没有讨论PDH催化剂设计未来发展的含义。
