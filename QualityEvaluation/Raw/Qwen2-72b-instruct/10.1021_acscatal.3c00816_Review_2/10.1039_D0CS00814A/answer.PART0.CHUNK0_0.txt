1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature regarding the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, or why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, based on general knowledge in the field, MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred due to their high thermal and hydrothermal stability, large surface area, and well-defined pore structures that can accommodate metal species while providing accessible active sites for the PDH reaction. Their uniform pore sizes also help to minimize diffusion limitations and coke formation. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the metal loading and distribution within the zeolite framework, as well as developing new synthesis methods to create hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer.

1.在文献中没有找到关于用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法,以及为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占主导地位的相关引用。但是,根据该领域的普遍知识,MFI和BEA沸石由于其高热稳定性和水热稳定性、大表面积以及可以容纳金属物种同时为PDH反应提供可接近活性位点的明确定义的孔结构而受到青睐。它们均匀的孔径也有助于最小化扩散限制和焦炭形成。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能会集中在优化沸石框架内的金属负载和分布,以及开发新的合成方法以创建分层孔结构,以改善质量传递。
