                    The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions have been extensively studied, with MFI and BEA topological zeolites emerging as dominant players due to their unique structural characteristics and synthesis ease \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. ZSM-5 zeolite, with its MFI topology, is favored for its three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which enhances its suitability as a catalyst carrier. Its superior coke accommodation capacity over γ-Al2O3 supports is attributed to its large surface area and channel characteristics. Metal promoters, like zinc, improve reaction selectivity by neutralizing support acidity, with their addition method impacting the final properties \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Sn-Beta zeolites, with single-site Sn atoms substituted in the BEA framework, are effective in PDH reactions due to their Lewis acid sites, which facilitate dehydrogenation. The synthesis involves dealumination of H-Beta followed by Sn incorporation, affecting the L/B ratio, crucial for PDH. High L/B ratios enhance dehydrogenation over cracking \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A mesoporous MFI zeolite synthesized with a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent has gained attention for its unique structure, featuring ultrathin frameworks and interconnected mesopores. This structure boosts catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and enhancing metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file suggest that the future of PDH catalyst design will focus on optimizing the interaction between metal species and zeolite supports to enhance catalytic performance. Tailoring zeolite properties, such as increased thermal stability and reduced acidity, could lead to more stable and selective PDH catalysts. The development of hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer and the adjustment of Si/Al ratios to prevent coke deposits will be crucial for enhancing catalytic stability. Future research may also explore the incorporation of other active metals for improved selectivity and stability, expanding the potential scope of PDH industrial catalysts.
