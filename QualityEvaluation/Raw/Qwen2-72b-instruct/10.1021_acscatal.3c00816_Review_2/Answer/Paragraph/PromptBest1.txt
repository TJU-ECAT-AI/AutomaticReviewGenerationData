The synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with a focus on MFI and BEA topological zeolites, reveals their dominance due to unique structural characteristics and synthesis methods \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. ZSM-5 zeolite, with an MFI topology, is favored for its three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, making it an effective support for platinum catalysts. Its superior coke accommodation capacity over γ-Al2O3 is attributed to its large surface area and channel structure. Incorporating metal promoters, such as zinc, enhances reaction selectivity by neutralizing support acidity \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Sn-Beta zeolites, featuring single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, are significant in PDH reactions due to their Lewis acid sites, crucial for dehydrogenation, and Brnsted acid sites responsible for cracking \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\].
