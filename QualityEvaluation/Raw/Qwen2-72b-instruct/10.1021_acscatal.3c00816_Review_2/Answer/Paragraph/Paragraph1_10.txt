Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those featuring MFI (Mobil Five) and BEA (Beta) zeolites, have garnered significant attention for their role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique synthesis methods, structural characteristics, and performance factors. Synthesized through various techniques including ion-exchange, impregnation, and hydrothermal methods, these catalysts incorporate metal species such as platinum, palladium, or iron within the zeolite framework. The MFI and BEA zeolites are distinguished by their microporous structure, high thermal stability, and acid sites, which are crucial for the PDH process. The performance of these catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by several factors: the type and loading of the metal, the zeolite's acidity, and the reaction conditions. High selectivity towards propylene and stability under PDH conditions are achieved through a delicate balance of these parameters, making metal-zeolite catalysts highly effective for industrial PDH applications.
