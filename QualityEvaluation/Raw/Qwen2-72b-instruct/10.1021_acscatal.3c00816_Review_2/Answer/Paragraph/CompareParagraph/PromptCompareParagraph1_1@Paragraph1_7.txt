The synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly focusing on MFI and BEA topological zeolites, reveals their dominance due to facile synthesis procedures, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_2\]. MFI zeolites, such as ZSM-5, are favored for their three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which enhance their suitability as catalyst carriers and their superior coke accommodation capacity compared to γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Incorporating metal promoters, like zinc, improves reaction selectivity by neutralizing acidity and creating new active centers \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Sn-Beta zeolites, featuring single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, are crucial for PDH reactions due to their Lewis acid sites, which facilitate dehydrogenation, and a high L/B ratio that benefits PDH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The synthesis involves dealumination and Sn incorporation, with the efficiency of dealumination impacting Sn incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A mesoporous MFI zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant, has gained attention for its unique structure featuring ultrathin frameworks and interconnected mesopores, which enhance catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and increasing metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, particularly focusing on MFI and BEA topological zeolites, offer a fertile ground for exploring innovative methodologies and emerging fields. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to achieve higher dispersion of active metal species, developing hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer, and adjusting Si/Al ratios to prevent coke deposits. The exploration of pre-transition metals as co-catalysts, despite synthetic challenges, presents an opportunity to expand the potential scope of PDH industrial catalysts \[10.1016/j.ces.2023.118450\]. Additionally, the utilization of zeolites with abundant silanol nests and suitable topology, like MFI and BEA, to disperse and stabilize active metal species could enhance catalytic performance \[10.1002/cctc.202101069\]. Tailoring zeolite properties, such as increased thermal stability and reduced acidity, could lead to more stable and selective PDH catalysts in the future \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are diverse, with postsynthesis methods like ion exchange and impregnation, and direct synthesis introducing metal sites during zeolite crystallization \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_2\]. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_2\]. ZSM-5 zeolite, with an MFI topology, is favored in PDH catalysts due to its three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, enhancing its suitability as a catalyst carrier \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Its superior coke accommodation capacity compared to γ-Al2O3 supports is attributed to its large surface area and channel characteristics \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Incorporating metal promoters, such as zinc, improves reaction selectivity by neutralizing support acidity \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. The method of promoter addition influences the final properties of the support and metallic phases \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Sn-Beta zeolites, featuring single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, are key in catalytic biomass conversion and PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The Lewis acid sites from single-site Sn facilitate dehydrogenation, while Brnsted acid sites cause cracking \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A high L/B ratio, indicative of more Lewis acid sites, enhances PDH efficiency \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Sn-Beta zeolites are synthesized through a two-step post-synthesis process: dealumination of H-Beta and Sn incorporation via impregnation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Dealumination efficiency is crucial for subsequent Sn incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. High HNO3 concentration aids Al removal, creating lattice defects for Sn incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The crystalline structure and pore architecture are preserved post-Sn incorporation, with Sn species tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Sn incorporation alters the acidity, creating Lewis acid sites crucial for PDH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Na-Sn-Beta zeolites with high Lewis acidity and low B/L ratio show optimal PDH performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Theoretical calculations suggest direct dehydrogenation pathways are more feasible \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A mesoporous MFI zeolite synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent has gained attention for its hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, which boosts catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and enhancing metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. This structure, featuring ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores, supports the discovery of not only REE-based but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts, expanding opportunities in catalytic applications for PDH reactions \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques for metal-zeolite catalysts, aiming to enhance the control over the distribution of metal species within the zeolite framework. The optimization of postsynthesis methods, such as ion exchange and impregnation, could lead to more efficient and selective PDH catalysts. Direct synthesis methods that introduce metal sites during zeolite crystallization may also be refined to achieve better integration of metal species with the zeolite structure. The exploration of new metal promoters, beyond zinc and tin, could expand the range of active sites available for PDH reactions. The synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites could be further optimized to improve dealumination efficiency and Sn incorporation, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The development of hierarchical pore structures in MFI and BEA zeolites could improve mass transfer and reduce coke formation, enhancing the stability and selectivity of PDH catalysts. The incorporation of other transition metals into mesoporous MFI zeolites could lead to the discovery of new alloy catalysts with improved catalytic properties. Theoretical calculations and computational modeling could be employed to predict the most feasible dehydrogenation pathways and guide the design of more efficient PDH catalysts. The optimization of metal loading and distribution, as well as the adjustment of Si/Al ratios, could prevent coke deposits and enhance the catalytic stability of PDH catalysts. The exploration of zeolites with tailored properties, such as increased thermal stability and reduced acidity, could lead to more stable and selective PDH catalysts in the future.
