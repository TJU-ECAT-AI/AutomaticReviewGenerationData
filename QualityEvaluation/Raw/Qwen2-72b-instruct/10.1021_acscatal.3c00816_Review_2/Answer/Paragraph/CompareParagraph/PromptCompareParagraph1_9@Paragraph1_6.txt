3. Metal-Zeolite Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network. (129) The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization).
Ion exchange procedure relies on the negative charge of zeolite framework (arising from Al substitution) to stabilize exchanged metal ions, which limits the metal loadings and metal types, as well as propylene selectivity. (130) Therefore, the preparation of metal-zeolite PDH catalysts employ impregnation and direct synthesis method. The developed zeolite materials were assigned to 235 framework types based on International Zeolite Association. Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 1&ndash;2), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. Hereafter, the advances in metal-zeolite PDH catalysts would be in turn discussed based on their topologic structure and synthesis method.
3.1. MFI Zeolite-Based Catalysts
3.1.1. Postsynthesis Method
Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s&ndash;1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s&ndash;1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s&ndash;1). Besides, the propylene selectivity over microporous Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta is also higher than that over mesoporous Pt-SBA-15. The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants. Similar to the case for an OMS, ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species. For example, Zhang et al. (33,34) reported that Sn substituted ZSM-5 (Sn-ZSM-5) was a promising support to load PtNa species for PDH. The resulting PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibits propane conversion of ∼39% with a propylene selectivity of 98%. Notably, the propane conversion could be retained at >30% with almost unchanged propylene selectivity during a 75 h stability test. The deactivation rate is only 0.006 h&ndash;1, which is lower than that of PtNa/ZSM-5 (0.024 h&ndash;1) and PtNaSn/ZSM-5 (0.014 h&ndash;1) synthesized via the coimpregnation method. The superior catalytic stability of PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 is due to the stronger antireduction capacity of incorporated SnOx species, which is favorable for the stabilization of metallic Pt sites on Sn oxides. This helps transfer coke deposits from Pt active sites to the support and benefits the catalytic stability. (132,133) Besides, a H2 cofeed would also contribute to the catalytic stability because a H2 cofeed helps weaken the propylene adsorption strength and surface coverage of coke precusors. (134) ZSM-5 zeolites were also attractive for Pt-free PDH catalysts. Chen et al. (85) compared the PDH performance of impregnated ZnOx species on various supports including SiO2, Al2O3, and ZSM-5 (with differing SAR values). SiO2 and Al2O3 supported ZnO exhibit almost no PDH activity. On ZSM-5 zeolites with low SAR, the Zn species mainly exchange with the Bronsted acidic protons to produce isolated Zn2+ cations and a small part of ZnO particles. These catalysts exhibit a high initial propane conversion of ∼85%, but soon decrease to ∼30% after 6 h of reaction. The fast deactivation is associated with low propylene selectivity (∼20%), which is caused by the serious cracking reactions due to strong Bronsted acid sites. On high-silica ZSM-5 (SAR = 250) zeolites, the Zn species tend to form small ZnO nanoparticles (∼4.5 nm) that strongly bonded with the zeolite framework, which exhibit a superior propane conversion of 60% and propylene selectivity of >80%. Similarly, this group reported that high-silica ZSM-5 supported CrOx also displays superior PDH activity compared to low-silica ZSM-5, SiO2, and Al2O3 supports. (86) Higher SAR leads to a decreased total acidity for CrOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. The total acidity positively correlates with the propane conversions, while it negatively correlates with the propylene selectivity. Notably, by fixing the Cr loading and SAR value, the propylene productivity on CrOx/H-ZSM-5 is 35 times higher than that of CrOx/Na-ZSM-5. The C3H8-TPD measurements evidence that Na+ doping weakens the propane adsorption ability. Accordingly, the author indicated a strong synergy between Bronsted acid sites and the Lewis acidic CrOx sites, which promotes propane adsorption and C&ndash;H bond activation on the CrOx/ZSM-5 catalyst.
Such a Lewis-Bronsted synergy effect in catalyzing PDH reactions was more carefully analyzed in the Ga/ZSM-5 system. Schreiber et al. (135) found that the propane dehydrogenation rate increases at low Ga/Al ratios (<0.5) and reaches maximum at Ga/Al = 0.5, while further increasing the Ga/Al ratios leads to a decreased dehydrogenation rate. By quantifying the amount of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites with pyridine-FTIR spectra, the authors found that the amount of Ga+ Lewis acidic sites was comparable to that of Si(OH)Al Bronsted acid sites for the catalysts with Ga/Al = 0.5, creating the highest amount of Lewis-Bronsted acidic pairs. During the reaction, the Bronsted acid site can protonate Ga+ to form [GaH]2+ species, which was indicated by the shift of the Ga K-edge white line peak from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV in XANES spectra. DFT calculations indicate that the propane C&ndash;H bond activation enthalpy barrier decreases from 176 kJ·mol&ndash;1 on Ga+ sites to 56 kJ·mol&ndash;1 on [GaH]2+ sites. Besides, the Bronsted acidic protons can also help eliminate H2 via a reaction with dehydrogenated H* species with a low barrier of ∼80 kJ mol&ndash;1. Bell et al. (88,136) also indicated [GaH]2+ as an active center for both propane dehydrogenation and cracking, which was evidenced by the fact that [GaH]2+-normalized dehydrogenation and cracking rates are independent of the Ga/Al ratios. Besides, the reaction rates are first order in C3H8 at low C3H8 pressure and become zero-order kinetics at higher C3H8 pressure. Increasing H2 pressure in reactants leads to decreased reaction rates as indicated by the negative reaction order in H2, which is because the [GaH]2+ converts to a paired [GaH2]+-H+ site upon a H2 cofeed. Together with the experimental apparent activation energies and the DFT-calculated intrinsic activation enthalpies, it was indicated that both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions initiate through the heterolytic dissociation of propane at [GaH]2+ sites to produce [C3H7-GaH]+-H+. Then dehydrogenation proceeds via β-H elimination from C3H7* intermediates to produce C3H6 and H2 products, which act as the rate limiting step. On the other hand, cracking proceeds via rate limiting C&ndash;C cleavage of C3H7*. Kinetic experiments also indicate the dehydrogenation TOF over [GaH]2+ sites is >2-times as that of cracking. (88) Yuan (137) proposed that instead of forming [GaHx] sites, the protons in Bronsted acid sites would remain stable and cooperate with the Ga sites in the form of a Ga+-H+ pair. The propane would be activated on the Ga+-H+ pair sites, followed by hydride elimination and the concurrent formation of C3H6 and H2. GaH acts as an intermediate in the PDH reaction, rather than a reactive site. The amounts of isolated Ga and the Ga+-H+ pair could be controlled by regulating SAR and Ga/Al ratios. The intrinsic activity of the Ga+-H+ pair is ∼15 times higher than that of isolated Ga+. The same group (87) further identified a unique Ga2O22+ site based on a set of H2/O2-pulsing experiments. In the ≤0.042 O2-pulsing experiments, the catalysts with Ga/Al ≤ 0.042 show no H2O formation and O2 consumption signals, indicating that these catalysts contain no oxidizable Ga sites (e.g., GaHx sites and Ga+-H+ pairs). In comparison, the samples with Ga/Al > 0.042 contain certain oxidizable Ga sites. The Co-exchanged (one exchanged Co2+ ion consumes one Al pair) ZSM-5 supported Ga sites exhibit comparable H2O formation and O2 consumption signals as parent ZSM-5 in the O2-pulse, while a negative correlation between Co-exchanged extent and GaHx formation was observed in H2-pulsing experiments. These quantitative pulse titration experiments identify two types of Ga sites with distinct redox properties: (1) Ga2O22+ site stabilized by framework Al pairs, which is redox-inert in H2 or O2 at 550 °C; (2) the conventional isolated Ga+ site, which is redox-active. The further C3H8 pulsing experiments reveal that the Ga2O22+ site possesses a higher PDH reaction rate (∼0.478 molC3H8·molGa&ndash;1·s&ndash;1), which is about 20 times that of isolated Ga+ sites.
In addition to the above-described Bronsted-Lewis synergy effect, (86,135,137) there is also a contrary viewpoint that Bronsted acid sites only act as cracking sites but do not contribute to PDH. (107,138) Iglesia et al. (138) reported that Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has higher propane conversion than Zn/H-ZSM-5 by a factor of 4. In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies indicate that Zn/Na-ZSM-5 contains isolated and stable (ZnOH)+ species at the exchange position, while the (ZnOH)+ species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 would react with neighboring zeolite OH groups to produce isolated (O&ndash;-Zn2+-O&ndash;) sites. Compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5, the Zn/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a higher content of deuterated products in C3H8-D2 cofeed reactions, confirming that (ZnOH)+ sites could facilitate the H2 recombination/step process toward enhanced PDH performance.
S-1 is the Al-free analogue of ZSM-5. The absence of Bronsted acid sites facilitates propylene desorption toward superior propylene selectivity compared to the counterparts with ZSM-5 supports. For example, Liu et al. (89) reported that ZnO/S-1 exhibits propylene selectivity of ∼90% in PDH, which is higher than ZnO/ZSM-5 (SAR = 250) with a selectivity of ∼80%. Although the nonacidic S-1 zeolites contribute to propylene selectivity improvement, it also possesses limitations by the lack of efficient anchor sites for impregnated metal species. (52) As a result, part of the metal species would inevitably locate at the outer surface of zeolite crystals during the impregnation process. These superficial metal species would easily sinter into large particles during calcination or the PDH reaction, which is unfavorable for catalytic performance. Ren et al. (96) reported that the calcination atmosphere would largely impact the Co site structure in Co/S-1 systems, which impacts the PDH activity. The characterizations show that oxygen-free calcination (Ar, H2, vacuum) contributes to the formation of Td Co2+ species within the S-1 framework. Taking Ar calcination as an example, the in situ DRIFT measurements reveal that Ar could drive Co precursors to silanol nests, which would contribute to the incorporation of Co species within the S-1 framework. The framework Td Co2+ sites facilitate the Lewis acidity and propane adsorption, exhibiting superior PDH activity against the air-calcinated catalyst with huge extraframework Co3O4 species. Specifically, Co-normalized propane TOF over the Ar calcinated catalysts is nine times that over air calcinated catalyst.
The partial substitution of Si atoms in S-1 by Ti leads to titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) zeolites. Zhu et al. (48) reported that the framework Ti in TS-1 zeolites contributes to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species and increases the electron density on Pt, which exhibits higher propane conversion (54.4%) than PtZnTi/S-1 catalyst (∼20%) without framework Ti species. Moreover, the framework Ti species can consume certain Si&ndash;OH groups, which would reduce the acidity of catalysts to facilitate propylene desorption, as indicated by C3H6-TPD measurements. Wu et al. (100) reported that the location of the Ti species could be finely tuned by controlling the Si/Ti ratios in TS-1 zeolites, which modulates the dispersion and chemical states of impregnated Co species. A moderate Si/Ti ratio of ∼30 leads to the coexistence of framework tetrahedral Ti and extraframework TiOx species, which would adjust the metal-zeolite interactions to an appropriate extent that enables the impregnated Co species to exist as a metallic state in PDH but avoids sintering into large nanoparticles. In contrary, smaller Si/Ti ratios (<30) lead to Co sites interacted with TiO2 crystallites, while larger Si/Ti ratios (>50) possess serious Co sintering. These two cases would both result in an inferior PDH performance. The optimal Co/TS-1 (Si/Ti = 30) catalyst obtains an initial propane conversion of ∼52% and gradually decreases to ∼26% after a 120 h PDH test with three regeneration cycles. The propylene selectivity remains >95%, and there is no obvious Co sintering throughout the test. Li et al. (46) reported the effect of the TS-1 particle size on PDH performance. TS-1 supports with varied particle sizes from 0.2 to 5 μm were synthesized by controlling the SiO2: TPAOH: H2O ratios in the hydrothermal precursor. The isopropanol additives further decrease the zeolite particle size to 0.1 μm. The zeolite particle sizes do not significantly affect the dispersion of impregnated PtSn species, but impact the mass transfer behavior toward different propane conversions. The PtSn catalyst on smaller-sized TS-1 (0.1 μm) exhibits the highest initial propane conversion of ∼55% and the least deactivation during a 7 h PDH test. The internal diffusion limitations were observed over large TS-1 zeolites (5.72 μm) based on the Weisz-Prater criterion, which causes the decrease in propane conversion and catalytic stability.
Zhao et al. (90) employed a MOF-assisted impregnation strategy to promote ZnOx dispersion on the S-1 support. First, the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as Zn precursor to disperse onto an S-1 support. The 2-methylimidazole ligands can isolate the Zn species during impregnation and were carbonized to a N-doped C (NC) layer during N2 calcination, which could prevent the sintering and volatilization of Zn species during the PDH reaction. The subsequent HNO3 treatments can partially dissolve ZnO species and generate ∼2.0 nm ZnO nanoparticles. As a result, the optimal ZnO@NC/S-1 (1.0) exhibits propane conversion of 55%, which is about 3.6 times higher than that of the directly impregnated ZnO/S-1 catalyst. In another work, Wang et al. (95) employed the CoZn bimetallic ZIF-67 as the precursor to introduce highly dispersed CoOx species on the S-1 support (Figure 4a). The Zn species help isolate the CoOx species, which were completely evaporated during the calcination process. The optimized CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst exhibits a propane TOF of ∼48.5 h&ndash;1 with a propylene selectivity >97% at 600 °C, which is about 4 times that of the counterpart without Zn addition (Figure 4b). All catalysts exhibit an induction period in the form of increased propane conversion in the initial stage, which was attributed to the reduction of the as-prepared Co3+ sites to Co2+ sites. When the NC layer was removed by air treatment at 550 °C, the Co2+ sites would be further reduced and aggregated to form bulk metallic Co particles during PDH, resulting in an obvious loss of PDH performance. As a result, the MOF-derived CoO@NC was deemed as an active site for PDH reaction.
The silanol nests arising from Si defects in zeolites can serve as effective anchor sites for metal and oxide sites. Zhao et al. (91) found that when treating the ZnO and silicalite-1 mixtures in a H2 flow, the reduced Zn0 species can react with silanol nests of S-1 to form binuclear Zn-O-Zn species (Figure 4c&ndash;d). More Si-OH nests contribute to the formation of more Zn-O-Zn species and higher propylene productivity (Figure 4e). The optimized ZnO/S-1\_3 with the most Zn-O-Zn sites exhibit exceptional PDH activity with a Zn-related TOF of 239 h&ndash;1, which is two times higher than the counterparts with single site Zn or ZnO nanoparticles as active sites (Figure 4f). The propylene productivity over this ZnO/S-1\_3 catalyst is three times that of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst at a similar propylene selectivity, which is superior to the reported noble-metal-free PDH systems. This ZnO/S-1\_3 catalyst also displays outstanding catalytic stability during a 400 h reaction. In addition, the highly reactive binuclear Zn-O-Zn sites can also be obtained when replacing S-1 by other molecular sieves or oxide supports with abundant Si-OH nests. In situ XAS and EPR spectra identify the coordinative unsaturated (partially reduced) Zn-O-Zn species as reactive center. DFT calculations further reveal that the Zn-O-Zn site possesses a lower apparent activation barrier (1.81 eV) than the single site Zn2+ (2.14 eV), which explains well the experimental observations.

The synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are diverse, encompassing postsynthesis techniques like ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis where metal sites are introduced during zeolite crystallization \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_2\]. Among these, MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate due to their facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size, which are crucial for PDH catalyst effectiveness and future developments \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_2\]. ZSM-5 zeolite, with its MFI topology, is favored in PDH due to its three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, making it an effective support for platinum catalysts \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Its superior coke accommodation capacity over γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, attributed to its large surface area and channel characteristics, is a key advantage \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. The addition of metal promoters, such as zinc, improves reaction selectivity by neutralizing acidity, with the method of addition impacting the final properties \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. Sn-Beta zeolites, featuring single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, are key in catalytic biomass conversion and PDH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The Lewis acid sites from single-site Sn facilitate PDH, with a high Lewis-to-Brnsted acid (L/B) ratio favoring dehydrogenation over cracking \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Sn-Beta synthesis involves dealumination of H-Beta followed by Sn incorporation, with dealumination efficiency impacting Sn atom incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. High HNO3 concentration aids Al removal, creating lattice defects for Sn incorporation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Sn-Beta retains its crystalline structure and pore architecture, with Sn species tetrahedrally coordinated, reducing the zeolite's reducibility and creating Lewis acid sites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Na-Sn-Beta-30, with the highest Lewis acidity and lowest B/L ratio, excels in PDH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Direct dehydrogenation pathways on open sites are kinetically favorable \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A mesoporous MFI zeolite synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent has gained attention for its hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, comprising ultrathin zeolite frameworks and interconnected mesopores \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. This structure boosts catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and enhancing metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. The use of this zeolite as a support enables the discovery of various alloy catalysts, expanding catalytic applications \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file suggest that the future of PDH catalyst design will focus on optimizing synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly for MFI and BEA topological zeolites. Innovations in postsynthesis techniques and direct synthesis methods will aim to enhance the tunable acidity and moderate pore size of these zeolites, crucial for PDH catalyst effectiveness. The development of hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer and the adjustment of Si/Al ratios to prevent coke deposits will be key areas of research \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The incorporation of other active metals, in addition to Pt and Sn, will be explored to improve selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The use of cerium-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for bimetallic PtSn catalysts will be further investigated for improved reaction performance \[10.1039/C6RA04173F\]. The optimization of metal-zeolite interactions, leveraging supports with abundant silanol nests and suitable topology, will be a priority for enhanced catalytic performance \[10.1002/cctc.202101069\]. Tailoring zeolite properties, such as increased thermal stability and reduced acidity, will lead to more stable and selective PDH catalysts in the future \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolites using multi-ammonium surfactants will be expanded to discover various alloy catalysts, including REE-based and transition metal-based alloys, for broader catalytic applications \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\].
