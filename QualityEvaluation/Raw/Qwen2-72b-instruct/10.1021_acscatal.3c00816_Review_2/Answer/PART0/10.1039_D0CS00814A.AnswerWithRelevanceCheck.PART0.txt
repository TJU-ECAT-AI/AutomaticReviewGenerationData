          The literature does not provide specific information on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, based on general knowledge in the field, MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred due to their high thermal and hydrothermal stability, large surface area, and well-defined pore structures that can accommodate metal species while providing accessible active sites for the PDH reaction. Their uniform pore sizes also help to minimize diffusion limitations and coke formation. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the metal loading and distribution within the zeolite framework, as well as developing new synthesis methods to create hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer. Additionally, zeolites with adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite) with some unique physical properties. The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their structural characteristics, such as high surface area, pore size, and shape selectivity, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of propane while inhibiting the formation of coke and other side reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the potential for further optimization of zeolite structures and the incorporation of other active metals to improve selectivity and stability.

          文献没有提供关于在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的具体信息，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，根据该领域的普遍知识，MFI和BEA沸石由于其高热稳定性和水热稳定性、大表面积以及可以容纳金属物种同时为PDH反应提供可接近活性位点的明确定义的孔结构而受到青睐。它们均匀的孔径也有助于最小化扩散限制和焦炭形成。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能会集中在优化沸石框架内的金属负载和分布，以及开发新的合成方法以创建分层孔结构，以改善质量传递。此外，具有可调Si/Al比和相对较大表面积的沸石可以阻止大烃分子的形成，从而防止所谓的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。Pt可以嵌入具有特殊三维通道的沸石中，如Pt@KA(LTA型沸石)和Pt@ZSM-5(MFI型沸石)，具有一些独特的物理性质。这些沸石在PDH反应中的有效性归因于它们的结构特性，如高表面积、孔径和形状选择性，这有利于丙烷的吸附和活化，同时抑制焦炭和其他副反应的形成。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，其潜在影响包括沸石结构的进一步优化和其它活性金属的掺入，以提高选择性和稳定性。
