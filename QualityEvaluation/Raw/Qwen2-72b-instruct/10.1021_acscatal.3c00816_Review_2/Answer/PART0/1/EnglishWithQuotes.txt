However, it does mention that Sn-Beta zeolites, which contain the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, have gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in various reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a previous report. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The literature also discusses the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process. The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite. The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process. The treatment of Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneficial to the removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. The crystalline structure and pore architecture of the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample are well maintained. The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure. The Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework. The Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes less reducible. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure. The Lewis acid rather than Brnsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents. These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019"},

The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a previous report.

The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The literature also discusses the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process. The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite. The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process. The treatment of Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneficial to the removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. The crystalline structure and pore architecture of the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample are well maintained. The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure. The Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework. The Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes less reducible. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure. The Lewis acid rather than Brnsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation.

However, it does mention that Sn-Beta zeolites, which contain the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, have gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in various reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a previous report. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The literature also discusses the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process. The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite. The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process. The treatment of Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneficial to the removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. The crystalline structure and pore architecture of the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample are well maintained. The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure. The Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework. The Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes less reducible. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure. The Lewis acid rather than Brnsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents. These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019"},

Zeolites like MFI and BEA may be favored due to their high surface area, uniform pore size distribution, and limited acidity, which are beneficial for dehydrogenation reactions.

However, it does mention that Sn-Beta zeolites, which contain the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, have gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in various reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a previous report. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The literature also discusses the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process. The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite. The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process. The treatment of Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneficial to the removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite. The crystalline structure and pore architecture of the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample are well maintained. The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure. The Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework. The Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes less reducible. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure. The Lewis acid rather than Brnsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The literature suggests that three-dimensional microporous materials like Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031"},

However, based on general knowledge in the field, MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred due to their high thermal and hydrothermal stability, large surface area, and well-defined pore structures that can accommodate metal species while providing accessible active sites for the PDH reaction. Their uniform pore sizes also help to minimize diffusion limitations and coke formation. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the metal loading and distribution within the zeolite framework, as well as developing new synthesis methods to create hierarchical pore structures for improved mass transfer. Additionally, zeolites with adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability. Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite) with some unique physical properties. The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their structural characteristics, such as high surface area, pore size, and shape selectivity, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of propane while inhibiting the formation of coke and other side reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the potential for further optimization of zeolite structures and the incorporation of other active metals to improve selectivity and stability.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
