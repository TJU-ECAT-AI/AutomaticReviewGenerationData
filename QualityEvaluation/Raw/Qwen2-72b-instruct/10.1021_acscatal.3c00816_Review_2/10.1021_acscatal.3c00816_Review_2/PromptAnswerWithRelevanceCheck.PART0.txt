Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, explaining why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. How do their structural characteristics and other factors contribute to their effectiveness, and what are the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design?

[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."
[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

1.The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include postsynthesis methods such as ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis where metal sites are introduced during zeolite crystallization. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their easy synthesis process, adjustable acidity, and appropriate pore size, which contribute to their effectiveness and have implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1.用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括后合成方法，如离子交换和浸渍，以及直接合成，即在沸石结晶过程中引入金属位点。MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH研究中占据主导地位，这可能归因于它们相对简单的合成程序、可调的酸性和适度的孔径。这些特性对它们的有效性有贡献，并对未来PDH催化剂设计的发展有影响。
