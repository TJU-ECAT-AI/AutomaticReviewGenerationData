[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."
[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

1.The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include postsynthesis methods such as ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis where metal sites are introduced during zeolite crystallization. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their easy synthesis process, adjustable acidity, and appropriate pore size, which contribute to their effectiveness and have implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1.丙烷脱氢反应中金属沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括后合成方法，如离子交换和浸渍，以及直接合成，即在沸石结晶过程中引入金属位点。MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH研究中占据主导地位，这可能归因于它们相对容易的合成程序、可调的酸性和适度的孔径。这些结构特性和其他因素对它们的有效性有贡献，并对未来PDH催化剂设计的发展有影响。
