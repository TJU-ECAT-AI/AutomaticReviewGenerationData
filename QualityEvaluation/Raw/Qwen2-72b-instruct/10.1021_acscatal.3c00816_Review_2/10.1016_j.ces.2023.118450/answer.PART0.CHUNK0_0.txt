1.The typical method for synthesizing metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves introducing post-transition metal elements such as Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc., to create co-catalysts. The emerging use of pre-transition metal elements like Ce, La, Y, etc., as co-catalysts is also being explored due to their specific catalytic properties and simple regeneration process. However, the development of these pre-transition metal catalysts is hindered by synthetic challenges. Bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts, particularly those with MFI and BEA topological structures, are considered among the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which facilitates the high dispersion of active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The bonding forces between Si-OH groups and rare-earth elements (REE) species enable the atomic dispersion of REE-MFI, which further integrates with Pt species to form an alloy. The low chemical potential energy of pre-transition metal oxides necessitates a high reduction temperature for alloy formation and requires atomistic migration of REE by the silanol nests inside the channels of siliceous zeolites.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中合成金属-沸石催化剂的典型方法是引入后过渡金属元素,如Sn、Zn、Ga、In、Fe等,以创建共催化剂。正在探索使用Ce、La、Y等预过渡金属元素作为共催化剂,因为它们具有特定的催化性质和简单的再生过程。然而,这些预过渡金属催化剂的开发受到合成挑战的阻碍。双金属-硅沸石催化剂,特别是具有MFI和BEA拓扑结构的催化剂,被认为是PDH催化剂中最有前景的催化剂之一,因为它们独特的孔结构有利于活性位点的高分散和可调的金属-支撑相互作用。Si-OH基团和稀土元素(REE)物种之间的键合力有利于实现原子分散的REE-MFI,它进一步与Pt物种结合形成合金。预过渡金属氧化物的低化学势能需要高温还原以形成合金,并需要REE通过硅沸石通道中的硅醇巢进行原子迁移。
