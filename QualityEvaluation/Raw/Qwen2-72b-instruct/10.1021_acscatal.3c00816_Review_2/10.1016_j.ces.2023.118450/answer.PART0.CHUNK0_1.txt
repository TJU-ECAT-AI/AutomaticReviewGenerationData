1.The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include the introduction of post-transition metal elements such as Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc., for synthesizing co-catalysts, and the use of pre-transition metal elements like Ce, La, Y, etc., as co-catalysts due to their specific catalytic properties and simple regeneration process. However, the development of pre-transition metal catalysts is hindered by synthetic challenges. The bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts are considered one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The bonding forces between Si-OH groups and REE species are favorable for achieving atomic dispersed REE-MFI, which further integrates with Pt species to produce an alloy.

1.丙烷脱氢反应中金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括引入Sn，Zn，Ga，In，Fe等后过渡金属元素来合成共催化剂，以及使用Ce，La，Y等预过渡金属元素作为共催化剂，因为它们具有特定的催化性能和简单的再生过程。然而，预过渡金属催化剂的开发受到合成挑战的阻碍。双金属硅酸盐沸石催化剂被认为是前景最广阔的PDH催化剂之一，因为其独特的孔结构有利于实现高分散的活性位点和可调的金属-支撑相互作用。Si-OH基团和REE物种之间的键合有利于实现原子分散的REE-MFI，它进一步与Pt物种整合以产生合金。
