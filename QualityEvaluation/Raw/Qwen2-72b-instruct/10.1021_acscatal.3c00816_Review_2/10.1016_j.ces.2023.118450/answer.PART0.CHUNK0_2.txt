1.The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include the introduction of post-transition metal elements like Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc., for synthesizing co-catalysts, and the emerging pre-transition metal elements like Ce, La, Y, etc., as co-catalysts due to their specific catalytic properties and simple regeneration process. However, the development of pre-transition metal catalysts is hindered by synthetic challenges. The bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts are considered one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The bonding forces between Si-OH groups and REE species are favorable for achieving atomic dispersed REE-MFI, which further integrates with Pt species to produce alloy. The BEA topology zeolites are well-crystalline and have typical characteristic diffraction peaks. The formation procedures of PtCe particles are disclosed by FT-IR spectroscopy, and the state of the metal species of the catalysts is verified by 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The metal-support interactions between Pt/Ce and supports are investigated by H2-TPR. The structure of active metals of the spent catalysts is identified by TEM characterization. Accessibility of the active sites is studied by C3H8-TPD. The influence of metal-support interactions on the structures of Pt catalytic sites is explored by in situ DRIFT-CO using CO as a probe molecule. The adsorption/desorption behavior of products upon the catalyst surface is studied by C3H6-TPD. The capability against the coke deposition under realistic reaction conditions is identified by TGA and Raman analysis. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their structural characteristics and other factors that contribute to their effectiveness. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the exploration of new synthesis methods for pre-transition metal catalysts and the optimization of metal-support interactions for improved catalytic performance.
