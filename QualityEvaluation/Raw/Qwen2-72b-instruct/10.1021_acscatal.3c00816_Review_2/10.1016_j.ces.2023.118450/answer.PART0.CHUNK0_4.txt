1.The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include the introduction of post-transition metal elements such as Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc., for synthesizing co-catalysts, and the investigation of pre-transition metal elements such as Ce, La, Y, etc., as co-catalysts due to their specific catalytic properties and simple regeneration process. However, the development of pre-transition metal element catalysts is hindered by synthetic challenges. The bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts are considered one of the most promising PDH catalysts due to their unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The bonding forces between Si-OH groups and REE species are favorable for achieving atomic dispersed REE-MFI, which further integrates with Pt species to produce alloy. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to their structural characteristics and the ability to achieve high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the need to address synthetic challenges for pre-transition metal element catalysts and the potential for further optimization of bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts.
