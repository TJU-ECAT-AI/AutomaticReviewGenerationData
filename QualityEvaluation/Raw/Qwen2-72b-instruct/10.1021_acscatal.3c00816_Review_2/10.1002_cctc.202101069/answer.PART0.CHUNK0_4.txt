1.The literature does not provide detailed analysis on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, which has an MFI topology, is used as a support for ZnO in the preparation of an efficient PDH catalyst. The S-1 zeolite is chosen for its topology without strong acidity, which is beneficial for the PDH reaction. The dispersed ZnO species on the S-1 support are stabilized via interaction with silanol nests, leading to high catalytic activity and stability. This suggests that the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites, such as their pore structure and acidity, play a crucial role in the effectiveness of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on optimizing the interaction between metal species and zeolite supports to enhance catalytic performance.

1.文献没有详细分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到，具有MFI拓扑结构的硅酸锂-1(S-1)沸石被用作ZnO的载体，用于制备高效的PDH催化剂。选择S-1沸石是因为其拓扑结构没有强酸性，这对PDH反应是有益的。S-1载体上的分散ZnO物种通过与硅醇巢的相互作用而稳定，导致高催化活性和稳定性。这表明MFI和BEA沸石的结构特性，如孔结构和酸性，在金属-沸石催化剂对PDH反应的有效性中起着至关重要的作用。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能会集中在优化金属物种与沸石载体之间的相互作用，以增强催化性能。
