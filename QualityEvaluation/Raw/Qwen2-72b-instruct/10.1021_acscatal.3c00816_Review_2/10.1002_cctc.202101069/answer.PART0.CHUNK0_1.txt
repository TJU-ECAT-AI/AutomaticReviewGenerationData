1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, which has an MFI topology, is used as a support for ZnO in the catalyst for PDH reaction due to its ability to disperse and stabilize ZnO species. The interaction between silanol nests of S-1 support and ZnO species suppresses aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions, leading to excellent PDH catalytic performance. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design could include the use of other MFI or BEA topological zeolites as supports for metal oxides to achieve high dispersion and stability of active species.

1.文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到，由于其能够分散和稳定ZnO物种，具有MFI拓扑结构的丝光沸石(S-1)被用作PDH反应中ZnO催化剂的支撑。S-1支撑和ZnO物种之间的硅醇巢相互作用在反应条件下抑制了ZnO物种的聚集，导致了优异的PDH催化性能。对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，可能的启示包括使用其他MFI或BEA拓扑沸石作为金属氧化物的支撑，以实现活性物种的高分散性和稳定性。
