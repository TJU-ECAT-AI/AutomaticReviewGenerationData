1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 (an MFI zeolite) is an efficient catalyst for PDH due to its high specific surface area, large pore volume, well-defined structure, and sparse Al sites, which cause Zn species to distribute well throughout the support. The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 also significantly improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. These factors suggest that MFI and BEA zeolites may be favored in PDH catalyst design due to their structural characteristics and acidity, which contribute to high catalytic activity and stability.

1.文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。然而，它确实提到，由于高比表面积、大孔体积、明确定义的结构和稀疏的Al位点，ZnO负载在高硅HZSM-5(一种MFI沸石)上是PDH的有效催化剂，这些特性导致Zn物种在整个支撑物上分布良好。高硅HZSM-5的适当调整的酸性也显著提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。这些因素表明，MFI和BEA沸石可能在PDH催化剂设计中受到青睐，因为它们的结构特性和酸性，这些特性有助于高催化活性和稳定性。
