          The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 (MFI topology) is an efficient catalyst for PDH due to its high specific surface area, large pore volume, well-defined structure, and sparse Al sites, which cause Zn species to distribute well throughout the support. The well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 also significantly improves propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design are that the structural characteristics and acidity of zeolite supports play crucial roles in the catalytic performance of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH.

          文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZnO负载在高硅HZSM-5(具有MFI拓扑结构)上是PDH的有效催化剂，因为其高比表面积、大孔体积、明确定义的结构和稀疏的Al位点，导致Zn物种在整个支撑体上分布良好。高硅HZSM-5的适当调整的酸性也显著提高了丙烯选择性和脱氢稳定性。对于PDH催化剂设计未来发展的意义是，沸石支撑体的结构特性和酸性在金属-沸石催化剂用于PDH的催化性能中起着关键作用。
