1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties that make it an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The substitution of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite affects the morphologies and physical structure of the zeolites, which in turn influences the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions. The substitution of cerium reduces the intensity of weak acid sites of the catalyst and increases the catalytic capacity to resist coke. The use of Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for platinum-tin catalysts in PDH reactions results in higher reaction activity and stability, with the optimal content of cerium in the support being 0.76 wt%. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design are that the incorporation of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites can improve the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions, and that the optimal content of cerium in the support should be considered when designing new catalysts.

1. 文献没有详细分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZSM-5沸石具有独特的物理性质，使其成为丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂载体应用的有趣材料。铈的框架替代影响了ZSM-5沸石的形态和物理结构，进而影响了PDH反应中催化剂的性能。铈的替代降低了催化剂弱酸位点的强度，提高了催化剂抵抗焦炭的能力。使用Ce改性的ZSM-5沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应中铂-锡催化剂的载体，结果是更高的反应活性和稳定性，支持中铈的最佳含量为0.76 wt%。PDH催化剂设计未来发展的含义是，铈在ZSM-5沸石框架中的掺入可以改善PDH反应中催化剂的性能，设计新催化剂时应考虑支持中铈的最佳含量。
