1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties that make it an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The substitution of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite affects the morphologies and physical structure of the zeolites, which in turn influences the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions. The substitution of cerium reduces the intensity of weak acid sites of the catalyst and increases the catalytic capacity to resist coke. The use of Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for platinum-tin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation results in higher reaction activity and stability. The optimal content of cerium in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the highest reaction activity and stability. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design are that the incorporation of cerium into the support of ZSM-5 zeolites can improve the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions.

1. 文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZSM-5沸石具有独特的物理性质，使其成为丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂载体应用的有趣材料。将铈替代到ZSM-5沸石的框架中会影响沸石的形态和物理结构，进而影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能。铈的替代降低了催化剂弱酸位点的强度，提高了催化剂抵抗焦炭的能力。使用Ce改性的ZSM-5沸石作为丙烷脱氢中铂-锡催化剂的载体，可导致更高的反应活性和稳定性。支持物中铈的最佳含量为0.76 wt%，这导致96.87%的高丙烯选择性以及最高的反应活性和稳定性。PDH催化剂设计未来发展的意义在于，将铈掺入ZSM-5沸石的载体中可以提高PDH反应中催化剂的性能。
