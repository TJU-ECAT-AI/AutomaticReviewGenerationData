1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties that make it an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in PDH reactions. The substitution of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite affects the morphologies and physical structure of the zeolites, reducing the intensity of weak acid sites of the catalyst and increasing the catalytic capacity to resist coke. The use of Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for platinum-tin catalysts in PDH reactions results in higher reaction activity and stability. The optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which leads to a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the highest reaction activity and stability.

1. 文献没有详细分析金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZSM-5沸石具有独特的物理性质，使其成为PDH反应中催化剂载体的有趣材料。将铈取代到ZSM-5沸石的框架中会影响沸石的形态和物理结构，降低催化剂的弱酸强度，提高催化剂抵抗焦炭的能力。使用Ce改性的ZSM-5沸石作为铂-锡催化剂在PDH反应中的载体，可导致更高的反应活性和稳定性。支持物中Ce的最佳含量为0.76 wt%，这导致96.87%的高丙烯选择性，以及最高的反应活性和稳定性。
