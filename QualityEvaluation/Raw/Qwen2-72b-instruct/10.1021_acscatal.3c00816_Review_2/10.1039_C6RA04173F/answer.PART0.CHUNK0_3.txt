1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties that make it an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The substitution of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite can influence the morphologies and textural properties of the supports, which in turn affects the dispersion of metallic particles, the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature, and the interaction of Sn species and the support. The use of Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for platinum-tin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation can result in higher amounts of Sn species existing in oxidative states, which can stabilize the active sites and improve the reaction activity and stability. The optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有详细分析金属沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要合成方法,也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是,它确实提到ZSM-5沸石具有独特的物理性质,使其成为丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂载体应用的有趣材料。将铈替代到ZSM-5沸石的框架中可以影响支撑材料的形态和纹理性质,这反过来又影响金属粒子的分散、在低温下吸附氢的能力以及Sn物种与支撑材料的相互作用。使用Ce改性的ZSM-5沸石作为丙烷脱氢中铂-锡催化剂的支撑材料,可以导致更多的Sn物种以氧化态存在,这可以稳定活性位点并提高反应活性和稳定性。支撑材料中Ce的最佳含量为0.76 wt%,这导致丙烷脱氢反应中最高的反应活性和稳定性。
