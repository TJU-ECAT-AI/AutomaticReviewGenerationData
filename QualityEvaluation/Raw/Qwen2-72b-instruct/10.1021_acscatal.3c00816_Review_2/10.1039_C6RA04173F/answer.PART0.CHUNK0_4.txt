1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties that make it an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in PDH reactions. The substitution of cerium into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite can influence the morphologies and textural properties of the supports, which can affect the dispersion of metallic particles, improve the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature, and enhance the interaction of Sn species and the support. The use of Ce-modified material can stabilize the active sites and promote higher amounts of Sn species in oxidative states, which can facilitate the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support. The substitution of Ce can also reduce the strength of the weak acidity and promote the migration of coke from the metal sites to the support. The optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation. The substitution of Ce into the support can make the modification effect of the promoter to the metal phase and support acidity more effective. The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA topological zeolites, such as their high thermal stability, high surface area, and high pore volume, contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include the use of Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for bimetallic PtSn catalysts, which can improve the reaction activity and stability.

1. 文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到ZSM-5沸石具有独特的物理性质，使其成为PDH反应中催化剂载体应用的有趣材料。将铈代入ZSM-5沸石的框架中可以影响支撑材料的形态和纹理性质，这可以影响金属颗粒的分散，提高在低温下吸附氢的能力，并增强Sn物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用。使用Ce改性材料可以稳定活性位点，并促进Sn物种在氧化状态下的更高量，这可以促进焦炭从金属活性位点向支撑材料的迁移。铈的替代也可以降低弱酸性的强度，并促进焦炭从金属位点向支撑材料的迁移。支撑材料中铈的最佳含量为0.76 wt%，这导致丙烷脱氢反应中最高的反应活性和稳定性。将铈代入支撑材料可以使促进剂对金属相和支撑酸性的修改效果更加有效。MFI和BEA拓扑沸石的结构特性，如高热稳定性、高表面积和高孔体积，对PDH反应的有效性有贡献。PDH催化剂设计未来发展的意义包括使用Ce改性ZSM-5沸石作为双金属PtSn催化剂的支撑材料，这可以提高反应活性和稳定性。
