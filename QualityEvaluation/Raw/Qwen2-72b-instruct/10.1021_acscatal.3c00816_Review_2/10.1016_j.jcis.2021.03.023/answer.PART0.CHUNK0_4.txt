1.No relevant quotes from the provided literature directly answer the question about why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) applications. However, the literature does focus on the synthesis of a cobalt oxide-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 (S-1), which is an MFI-type zeolite. This suggests that MFI-type zeolites are favored for their structural stability, high surface area, and tunable acidity, which are beneficial for PDH reactions. The isolation of active sites within the zeolite framework is also highlighted, indicating that the zeolite's pore structure can help prevent the aggregation of active metal species, leading to improved catalytic performance and stability. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may involve further optimization of metal-zeolite interactions, exploration of different metal species, and the use of zeolites with varying topologies to enhance selectivity and efficiency.

1.提供的文献中没有直接回答为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)应用中占主导地位的相关引用。然而,文献确实专注于在丝光沸石(S-1)上合成基于氧化钴的催化剂,丝光沸石是MFI型沸石。这表明MFI型沸石因其结构稳定性、高表面积和可调酸性而受到青睐,这对PDH反应有益。还强调了在沸石框架内隔离活性位点,表明沸石的孔结构有助于防止活性金属物种的聚集,从而提高催化性能和稳定性。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能涉及进一步优化金属-沸石相互作用、探索不同的金属物种以及使用具有不同拓扑结构的沸石来增强选择性和效率。
