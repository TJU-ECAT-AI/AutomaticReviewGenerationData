Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, explaining why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. How do their structural characteristics and other factors contribute to their effectiveness, and what are the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design?

1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species to suppress cracking side reactions to realize high-performance PDH is critical. In this work, different Co species over Silicalite-1 are synthesized via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere and investigated for PDH systematically. The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance.

1. 文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到基于钴的催化剂因其价格低廉、环境友好和高活性而受到广泛关注，用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)。合成抗还原Co物种以抑制裂解副反应以实现高性能PDH是关键。在本工作中，通过调节热处理气氛在Silicalite-1上合成不同的Co物种，并系统地研究了PDH。在Co-S-1-Ar上，高度分散的四面体配位Co2+物种与Lewis酸位点一起被掺入到Silicalite-1框架中，对PDH的优异性能负责。
