1. The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species to suppress cracking side reactions to realize high-performance PDH is critical. In this work, different Co species over Silicalite-1 are synthesized via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere and investigated for PDH systematically. The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance.

1. 文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到基于钴的催化剂因其价格低廉、环境友好和高活性而受到广泛关注，用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)。合成抗还原Co物种以抑制裂解副反应，实现高性能PDH是关键。在本研究中，通过调节热处理气氛在Silicalite-1上合成不同的Co物种，并系统地研究了PDH。在Co-S-1-Ar上，高度分散的四面体配位Co2+物种与Lewis酸位点一起被掺入到Silicalite-1框架中，这是PDH优异性能的原因。
