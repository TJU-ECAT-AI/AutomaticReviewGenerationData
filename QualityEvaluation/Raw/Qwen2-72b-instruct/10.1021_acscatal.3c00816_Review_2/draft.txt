1. Synthesis methods, structural characteristics, and performance factors of metal-zeolite catalysts, with emphasis on MFI and BEA zeolites, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions

        The synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly those featuring MFI and BEA topological zeolites, has been extensively studied \[10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008\]. MFI zeolites, such as ZSM-5, are favored due to their three-dimensional channel structure and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which enhance their suitability as catalyst carriers. Their superior coke accommodation capacity over γ-Al2O3 supports is attributed to their large surface area and channel characteristics. Metal promoters, like zinc, improve reaction selectivity by neutralizing acidity, with the method of addition impacting the support and metallic phase properties. Zinc incorporation into ZSM-5 creates new active centers, altering catalytic behavior compared to conventional preparation techniques. BEA topological zeolites, such as Sn-Beta, are also pivotal in PDH reactions due to their single-site Sn atoms facilitating dehydrogenation while Brnsted acids promote cracking. A high Lewis-to-Brnsted acid (L/B) ratio is advantageous for PDH, and the Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acidity and lowest B/L ratio, excels in PDH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. A mesoporous MFI zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant, has gained attention for its unique structure featuring ultrathin frameworks and interconnected mesopores, enhancing catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion and increasing metal nanoparticle dispersion \[10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4\]. Cerium substitution in ZSM-5 zeolites enhances PDH catalyst performance by affecting morphologies and textural properties, improving metallic particle dispersion, and increasing hydrogen adsorption at low temperatures \[10.1039/C6RA04173F\]. MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in PDH reactions due to their pore geometry, which significantly influences activity, selectivity, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031\]. Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, with an MFI topology, serves as a support for ZnO in PDH catalysts, enhancing dispersion and stability of ZnO species via interaction with silanol nests \[10.1002/cctc.202101069\]. Metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH use postsynthesis (ion exchange, impregnation) and direct synthesis methods. MFI and BEA zeolites lead in PDH due to easy synthesis, adjustable acidity, and moderate pore size, crucial for effectiveness and future PDH catalyst design \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_2\]. ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 (MFI topology) excels in PDH due to its high specific surface area, large pore volume, well-defined structure, and sparse Al sites, promoting uniform Zn distribution \[10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508\]. MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their high thermal and hydrothermal stability, large surface area, and well-defined pore structures that accommodate metal species and provide accessible active sites \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Zeolites, due to their high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain dispersion of active metal particles, are favored as supports for PDH catalysts. MFI and BEA zeolites, with their high surface area, uniform pore size distribution, and limited acidity, stabilize small metal particles, improving catalyst stability and selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in metal-zeolite catalyst design for PDH reactions, particularly focusing on MFI and BEA topological zeolites, have revealed the critical role of structural characteristics, synthesis methods, and metal-support interactions. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing metal loading and distribution, developing synthesis methods for hierarchical pore structures, and adjusting Si/Al ratios to prevent coke deposits and improve catalytic stability. The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH is attributed to their structural properties, such as uniform pore sizes and shape selectivity, which inhibit the formation of coke and other side reactions. Potential developments include optimizing zeolite structures and incorporating other active metals for improved selectivity and stability. The exploration of emerging fields, such as the use of pre-transition metals as co-catalysts, despite synthetic challenges, offers promising avenues for innovative methodologies in PDH catalyst design.
