1.The literature does not provide a direct answer to the question about the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that a mesoporous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure was used as a replacement for alumina support in the search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst. This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The literature also indicates that the use of the present mesoporous zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications.

1.文献没有直接回答关于用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的问题，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。然而，它确实提到，使用多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂合成的具有层次微/介孔结构的MFI沸石被用作替代氧化铝支持物，用于寻找活性更高、更耐用的PDH催化剂。这种沸石因其独特的结构而受到关注，作为先进的催化剂载体，其结构包括超薄沸石框架和三维互连的介孔，通过提供反应物和产物的便捷扩散以及介孔内金属纳米粒子的高分散性，提高了所支持金属的催化性能。文献还表明，使用当前的介孔沸石作为载体，将允许发现不仅基于REE的合金催化剂，还有其他过渡金属基合金催化剂，具有各种组成和结构，为催化应用开辟了新的机遇。

The literature also states that the PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C.
