1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that a mesoporous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores. The literature also states that the PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C.

1.文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，文献确实提到，使用多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂合成的具有分级微/介孔结构的MFI沸石，因其独特的结构而受到关注，作为先进的催化剂载体，这种结构由超薄沸石框架和三维互连的介孔组成，通过提供易于反应物和产物扩散以及在介孔内高度分散的金属纳米粒子，提高了所支持金属的催化性能。文献还指出，PtREE在介孔沸石中的掺入是通过Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2和La(NO3)3·6H2O或Y(NO3)3·6H2O的水溶液的共浸渍进行的，随后在350C的O2流下加热，然后在700C的H2下加热。
