1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that the Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization. The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

1.文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到Sn-Beta沸石，其中单个Sn原子等形态地替代在BEA框架中，并且具有由3维12元环通道组成的开放孔系统，在催化生物质转化中获得了广泛的应用，用于C-C键偶联和C-O键断裂，如Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley还原(MPV还原)、Diels-Alder环加成和葡萄糖-果糖异构化。Sn-Beta沸石在我们之前的报告中被应用于丙烷脱氢反应。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单个Sn的Lewis酸位点上。Sn-Beta中的Lewis酸是脱氢反应的活性位点，而Brnsted酸负责裂解反应。脱氢率/裂解率与L/B比正相关，较高的L/B比有利于丙烷脱氢反应。
