1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that Sn-Beta zeolites, which contain the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, have gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion and propane dehydrogenation. The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a previous report. The literature also discusses the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process. The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process. The literature does not provide information on the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1.文献没有详细分析金属沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到Sn-Beta沸石，其中单点Sn原子等形态地替代了BEA框架中的Sn原子，在催化生物质转化和丙烷脱氢中获得了广泛的应用。Sn-Beta沸石在之前的报告中被应用于丙烷脱氢反应。文献还讨论了Sn-Beta沸石的合成，通过一个成熟的两步后合成程序，包括对母体H-Beta的脱铝，然后通过浸渍过程将Sn物种掺入到脱铝Si-Beta的框架中。脱铝的效率极大地影响了随后的Sn原子掺入过程。文献没有提供关于PDH催化剂设计未来发展的含义的信息。
