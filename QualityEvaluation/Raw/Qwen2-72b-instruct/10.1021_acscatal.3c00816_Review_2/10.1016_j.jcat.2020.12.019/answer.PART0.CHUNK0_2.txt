1.The literature does not provide a detailed analysis of the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does mention that the Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion. The literature also states that the incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalysts, and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The literature does not discuss the structural characteristics and other factors that contribute to the effectiveness of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in PDH reactions, nor does it provide implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

1.文献没有详细分析用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属沸石催化剂的主要合成方法，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在这一应用中占据主导地位。但是，它确实提到Sn-Beta沸石，其中含有单个Sn原子，等形态地替代BEA框架中的Sn原子，在催化生物质转化中获得了广泛的应用。文献还指出，将金属物种掺入沸石晶格或框架已被证实是构建单位点催化剂的另一种有效策略，而沸石中孤立的金属物种由于框架结构的强锚定效应而显示出增强的稳定性。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单个Sn位点的Lewis酸位点上。文献没有讨论MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在PDH反应中的结构特征和其他因素，也没有提供PDH催化剂未来发展的含义。
