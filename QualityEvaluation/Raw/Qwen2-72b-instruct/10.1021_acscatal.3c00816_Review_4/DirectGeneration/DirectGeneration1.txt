Zeolite-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process due to their high activity and selectivity. The preparation methods for these catalysts typically involve hydrothermal synthesis, where precursors are crystallized under high temperature and pressure to form the desired zeolite structure. Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis are employed to determine the crystallinity, morphology, and textural properties of the zeolites. Among the various zeolite types, BEA topology (Beta zeolite) and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites have shown promising results in PDH. BEA zeolites, with their large pore size and high thermal stability, offer excellent catalytic performance, while SAPO zeolites, characterized by their high acidity and shape-selectivity, are particularly effective in enhancing the selectivity towards propylene. Comparative studies have revealed that the performance of these zeolite-based catalysts can be further optimized by modifying the synthesis conditions, such as the Si/Al ratio and the presence of templating agents, to tailor the acidity and pore structure for improved PDH activity and selectivity.
