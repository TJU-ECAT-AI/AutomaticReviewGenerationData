[1] "Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications."
[2] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."
[3] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

1.The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation, followed by direct reduction, results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta. The restrictions imposed by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn prevent coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, leading to excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation, with 90% of maximum propane conversion maintained over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

1.将亚纳米团簇封装在沸石晶体的孔或笼中可以显著提高其稳定性，从而拓宽催化应用。我们利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定铂前体，随后直接还原，形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米团簇（Pt@Sn-Beta）。沸石孔隙的限制和Sn的电子效应抑制了超细Pt团簇的焦炭形成和烧结，从而在丙烷脱氢过程中实现了优异的稳定性，保持了90%的最大丙烷转化率超过250小时，丙烯选择性为99%。
