[1] "Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications."
[2] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."
[3] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

1.The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite crystals enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The framework-Sn in Beta zeolite anchors platinum precursors during impregnation, forming confined Pt subnanometric clusters. The zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, achieving excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

1.在沸石晶体的孔隙或笼中封装亚纳米簇（单原子和超小簇）可以显著提高其稳定性，从而拓宽催化应用。我们利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定铂前体，形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米簇（Pt@Sn-Beta）。沸石孔隙的限制和Sn的电子效应抑制了超细Pt簇的焦炭形成和烧结，从而在丙烷脱氢中实现了优异的稳定性，保持了90%的最大丙烷转化率超过250小时，丙烯选择性为99%。
