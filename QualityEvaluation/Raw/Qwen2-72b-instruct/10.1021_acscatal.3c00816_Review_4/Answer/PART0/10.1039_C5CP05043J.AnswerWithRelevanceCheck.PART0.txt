          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO物种引入ZSM-5和Y沸石中，增强了丙烷转化的催化活性。沸石的拓扑结构，如孔径和结构，影响前体的可及性和活性物种的分布。组成，特别是ZnO的负载和形式，影响选择性和转化率。孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比更大的ZnO簇更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃。催化剂的稳定性受到诸如焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO沉积到ZSM-5和Y沸石上，可以提高丙烯的选择性和转化率。ALD过程允许对ZnO团簇的大小和分布进行精确控制，这影响催化活性和稳定性。提高性能的关键因素包括存在孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，这些物种对丙烷转化更有效，以及脱氢和后续反应之间的平衡，后者需要Brønsted酸位。催化剂稳定性受焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。文献没有提供具体信息，说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，也没有详细说明提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素，对于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石尤其如此。文献没有提供关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂(特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石)在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，以及提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素的信息。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO沉积到ZSM-5和Y沸石上，形成高度分散的ZnO物种，从而提高了这两种沸石在丙烷转化中的活性。母体和ALD ZnO改性沸石上酸位点的类型和强度在反应途径中起着关键作用。通过ALD将ZnO掺入Y沸石中，完全消除了Brnsted酸位点，增加了强Lewis酸位点的数量，而在ALD ZnO改性的ZSM-5上，Brnsted酸位点仅部分被去除。在ZnO ALD的第一周期后，在这两种沸石上形成的孤立Zn(OH)+物种对丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃更有效。沸石的孔径和拓扑结构也影响ZnO物种的分布和反应物到达活性位点的可及性。对于ZSM-5，前体分子只能在第一个ALD周期中渗透到微孔中，而对于Y沸石，前体分子可以在ZnO ALD的前三个周期中渗透到微孔中。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括ZnO物种的分散和形式、酸位点的类型和强度以及沸石的孔结构。
