The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity.

Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance.

The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications.

The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported.

The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.

The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction.

PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite.

Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy, involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation, leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the tetrahedral coordination states of the Si-beta framework. This, in turn, promotes the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with high propene formation rates and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance.

The encapsulation of subnanometric clusters within zeolite pores or cages enhances their stability and broadens catalytic applications. The use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta, which exhibits excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation due to the restrictions provided by zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn, inhibiting coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters. This leads to maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.
