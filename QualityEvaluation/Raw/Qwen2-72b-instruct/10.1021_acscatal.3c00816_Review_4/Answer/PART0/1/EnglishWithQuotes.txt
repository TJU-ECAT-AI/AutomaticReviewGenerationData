{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5CP05043J"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.", "Doi": "10.1039/D1CY00738F"},

The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

"The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.", "Doi": "10.1039/D1CY00738F"},

Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h.

The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction.

The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite.

The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite.

The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite.

The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite.

The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},
