[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
          [2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
          [3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
          [4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
          [5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
          [6] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
          [7] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
          [2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
          [3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
          [5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
          [6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."
          [7] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
          [8] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
          [9] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."





[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
          [2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
          [3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
          [5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
          [6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
          [7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
          [8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
          [9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
          [10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
          [11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
          [12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
          [13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."

          [17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
          [18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
          [19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
          [20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
          [21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          [99] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
          [100] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."

[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
          [2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
          [3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
          [4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
          [5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
          [6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
          [7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
          [8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
          [9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
          [10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
          [11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
          [12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
          [13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
          [14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
          [15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
          [16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
          [17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
          [18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
          [19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
          [20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [2] "The support has a very important role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst."
          [3] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
          [4] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [7] "The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
          [8] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."
          [9] "The support (SAPO-34 catalyst) was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100."

          [11] "The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 C, to ensure 0.8, 1, and 1.2 wt % Sn in the final catalyst."
          [12] "Later, this prepared Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was coimpregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 70 C to give a 0.3 and 0.5 wt % Pt in the final catalyst."
          [13] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of prepared PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV."

          [24] "The 5% mixture of H2/N2 was used as reducing gas."
          [25] "Hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was obtained by TCD and recorded."
          [26] "In the temperature-programmed oxidation for coke analysis the sample of 0.2 g after the reaction test was used."
          [27] "The samples were purged in a N2 at the flow rate 40 mL/min at 500 C for 30 min."
          [28] "Later the temperature was slowly decreased to 30 C."
          [29] "Then the mixture of 2% oxygen and 98% helium by volume was passed through the samples at the flow rate of 40 mL/min."
          [30] "The temperature was ramped up at the rate 10 C/min and the CO2 was measured by an online gas analyzer QIC-20 (HIDEN, England)."
          [31] "IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on different PtSn/SAPO-34 samples were obtained using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA)."

          [35] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
          [36] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during the propane dehydrogenation process is particularly due to aggregation of Pt particles."
          [37] "Therefore, Sn helps Pt to disperse during catalyst manufacturing and in this way it significantly improves catalytic performance."
          [38] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
          [39] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
          [40] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
          [41] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
          [42] "The Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity."
          [43] "With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined."
          [44] "The optimum Sn loading was found to be about 1 wt %, which gave selectivity to propylene of 93.6% at a time on stream (TOS) of 8 h."
          [45] "The decrease in propylene selectivity was mainly due to the thermal/catalytic cracking of propylene and propane and has no relationship with the loss of catalyst activity."
          [46] "The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature for higher propylene selectivity was observed to be 585 C."
          [47] "A decrease in the WHSV initially increases the propylene selectivity at the cost of higher conversion."
          [48] "At higher WHSVs above 5.6 h1 both selectivity and conversion dropped."
          [49] "The presence of H2 not only prevents the catalyst from coke formation but also continuously reduces the active Pt sites and maintains catalytic activity without affecting secondary propylene formation reaction."
          [50] "The H2/C3H8 molar ratio during the propane dehydrogenation reaction over PtSn/SAPO-34 was prominent among the operating parameters."
          [51] "Deviations from a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25 decreased both selectivity and conversion."
          [52] "The best propane conversion range to have good propylene selectively was between 14% and 23% conversions, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94%, with high total olefins selectivity."
          [53] "While at higher conversions propylene selectivity dropped sharply with a minor drop in total olefins selectivity, and ethane formation was promoted."
          [54] "It was further noted that lower conversion favors cracking, while higher conversions favor both cracking and hydride-transfer reaction with the decrease in dehydrogenation rate."
          [55] "The deactivation of catalyst also leads the reaction toward cracking."
          [56] "The original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support was not changed."
          [57] "The peaks for Pt and Sn were not found owing to their smaller concentration, but it is believed that they are monodispersed initially."
          [58] "The peak height decreased slowly between (angle 2θ) 8 and 10 with the increase in Sn loading, which may be due to the change in surface characters."
          [59] "The successful loading of metals were confirmed from XRF analysis."
          [60] "It was noted from BET results that the metallic incorporation modified the geometric effect of the catalyst."
          [61] "The surface area decreased from 419 to 396 m2/g, with the increase in Sn loading from 0.8 to 1.2 wt %."
          [62] "This surface area loss is due to the pores blocking by Sn and/or Pt."
          [63] "The content of Sn has a wide impact on the catalyst geometry."
          [64] "Two ammonia desorption peaks that were obtained between 215240 C and 400425 C demonstrate weak acid sites (SiOSi) and strong acid sites (due to framework Al species), respectively."
          [65] "The analysis confirmed that after the impregnation of different Sn contents shows that there is almost negligible effect on the acidity of support."
          [66] "Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperature were observed, i.e., due to slight decrease in acid intensity."
          [67] "The highest ammonia uptake was noted at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34."
          [68] "The small decrease in peak intensities was noted after the increase in Sn loading."
          [69] "This decreased intensity of Bronsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active for cracking of propane and improve stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity."
          [70] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
          [71] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
          [72] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."
          [73] "The increased Sn loading starts shifting the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures."
          [74] "It was due to the formation of Sn0 species, with the increase in Sn loading."
          [75] "The direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 were not active for dehydrogenation."
          [76] "The Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction."
          [77] "The presence of Sn facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support."
          [78] "It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support."
          [79] "Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."
          [80] "The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improve catalyst stability."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
          [5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."



Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.
          We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction.
          The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
