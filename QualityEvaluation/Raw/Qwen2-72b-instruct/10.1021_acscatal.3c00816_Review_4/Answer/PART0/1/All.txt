The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability.

The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。催化剂的最优操作条件是温度585 C，小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，Sn含量从1 wt%增加会不利地影响催化剂的性能。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，帮助减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。SAPO-34载体的制备涉及将Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O以特定的摩尔比混合。通过顺序浸渍煅烧的SAPO-34与SnCl2·2H2O和H2PtCl6溶液来制备双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，以实现所需的Sn和Pt负载量。XRD图案证实了催化剂的结构，而XRF测量验证了金属含量。BET表面积测量和TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成方面的见解。IR光谱用于研究催化剂的酸性。PtSn基催化剂的脱氢性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。在丙烷脱氢过程中，Pt的聚集是催化剂失活的主要原因，但Sn有助于在催化剂制备过程中分散Pt，从而提高催化性能。Sn通过改变金属与载体之间的界面特性来修改表面Pt集合体，并促进金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移。丙烷脱氢的最优操作条件为585 C、WHSV为5.6 h1、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25和14-25%的转化范围。Sn的存在在一定限度内（1 wt %）提高了催化性能，但超过这个限度，它会降低反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有重大影响。XRD图案显示，Pt和Sn的掺入并未改变SAPO-34沸石载体的原始结构/拓扑。由于Pt和Sn的浓度较低，无法观察到它们的峰，但它们最初被认为是单分散的。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高逐渐降低，这可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF分析证实了金属的成功负载，而BET结果表明，金属掺入改变了催化剂的几何效应。随着Sn负载量的增加，表面积从419降低到396 m2/g，这是由于Sn和/或Pt堵塞了孔隙。Sn含量对催化剂的几何形状有重大影响。NH3-TPD和IR分析表明，Sn（0.8-1.2 wt %）的存在对催化剂的酸性几乎没有影响。峰向较低温度的小幅偏移表明酸强度略有下降。在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34中观察到最高的氨吸收量。在增加Sn负载量后，峰强度的小幅下降减少了Bronsted酸位的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，并提高了反应向更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度（1.2 wt %）下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位，即使在较高酸性下，转化率也较低。H2-TPR结果表明，Sn的存在改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度（从1 wt %）导致Sn0物种的形成。在较高温度下的还原峰表明，在Sn存在下，Pt与载体之间有良好的相互作用。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高和宽度增加，这可能是由于Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的联合还原和有价值的相互作用。增加的Sn负载量将较高温度峰向较低还原温度偏移，表明Sn0物种的形成。直接锚定在SAPO-34上的Pt位点对脱氢不活跃，但附着在SnOx上的Pt被认为对反应有活性。Sn的存在促进了金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移，这只有在金属与载体良好相互作用时才可能发生。Sn通过降低表面积和减少碳-金属键/相互作用来修改Pt集合体，使中间体容易移动到载体上。Sn的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭形成反应来减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

"The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH.

The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction.

The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。催化剂的最优操作条件是温度585 C，小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，Sn含量从1 wt%增加会不利地影响催化剂的性能。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，帮助减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。SAPO-34载体的制备涉及将Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O以特定的摩尔比混合。通过顺序浸渍煅烧的SAPO-34与SnCl2·2H2O和H2PtCl6溶液来制备双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，以实现所需的Sn和Pt负载量。XRD图案证实了催化剂的结构，而XRF测量验证了金属含量。BET表面积测量和TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成方面的见解。IR光谱用于研究催化剂的酸性。PtSn基催化剂的脱氢性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。在丙烷脱氢过程中，Pt的聚集是催化剂失活的主要原因，但Sn有助于在催化剂制备过程中分散Pt，从而提高催化性能。Sn通过改变金属与载体之间的界面特性来修改表面Pt集合体，并促进金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移。丙烷脱氢的最优操作条件为585 C、WHSV为5.6 h1、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25和14-25%的转化范围。Sn的存在在一定限度内（1 wt %）提高了催化性能，但超过这个限度，它会降低反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有重大影响。XRD图案显示，Pt和Sn的掺入并未改变SAPO-34沸石载体的原始结构/拓扑。由于Pt和Sn的浓度较低，无法观察到它们的峰，但它们最初被认为是单分散的。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高逐渐降低，这可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF分析证实了金属的成功负载，而BET结果表明，金属掺入改变了催化剂的几何效应。随着Sn负载量的增加，表面积从419降低到396 m2/g，这是由于Sn和/或Pt堵塞了孔隙。Sn含量对催化剂的几何形状有重大影响。NH3-TPD和IR分析表明，Sn（0.8-1.2 wt %）的存在对催化剂的酸性几乎没有影响。峰向较低温度的小幅偏移表明酸强度略有下降。在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34中观察到最高的氨吸收量。在增加Sn负载量后，峰强度的小幅下降减少了Bronsted酸位的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，并提高了反应向更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度（1.2 wt %）下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位，即使在较高酸性下，转化率也较低。H2-TPR结果表明，Sn的存在改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度（从1 wt %）导致Sn0物种的形成。在较高温度下的还原峰表明，在Sn存在下，Pt与载体之间有良好的相互作用。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高和宽度增加，这可能是由于Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的联合还原和有价值的相互作用。增加的Sn负载量将较高温度峰向较低还原温度偏移，表明Sn0物种的形成。直接锚定在SAPO-34上的Pt位点对脱氢不活跃，但附着在SnOx上的Pt被认为对反应有活性。Sn的存在促进了金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移，这只有在金属与载体良好相互作用时才可能发生。Sn通过降低表面积和减少碳-金属键/相互作用来修改Pt集合体，使中间体容易移动到载体上。Sn的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭形成反应来减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.\"", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。CoOx物种在脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石中被限制在T位点(硅醇)中，在H2或反应气体下可发展成超小Co颗粒，对催化PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。已识别出高度分散的CoOx物种，易于还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta载体创建的T位点(硅醇)中。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，但不同的诱导期，表明在反应中形成的金属Co是活性位点。在600°C下，SiBeta沸石中0.5 wt%的Co显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，丙烷转化率约为72%，丙烯选择性超过92%，远优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度预示着长期的实用性，据报道，Co对PDH具有一定的催化活性。Co(II)对丙烷CH活化的催化能力由Coperet等人提出。胡等人报道，硅基单位点Co2+对丙烯具有高度选择性，并提出了一种涉及单位点Co2+位点上异裂CH键的非氧化还原机制。随后，他们提出，CoAl2O4中作为Lewis酸性位点的四面体Co2+物种也是PDH反应中的活性位点。小金属Co颗粒被限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而SiBeta载体上的大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒分别导致裂解和碳沉积。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出相当大的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。钴物种主要以CoOx的形式存在于0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的T位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过600°C下1小时的预还原处理，其催化性能都非常相似，尽管诱导期不同，这表明限制的CoOx可以在反应中还原为金属Co。随着Co负载量的增加，初始丙烷转化率从0.5CoSiBeta的40%增加到10CoSiBeta的86%。0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta催化剂的最大丙烷转化率分别约为53、59、80和81%。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性非常高且稳定，在整个反应中稳定在约98%。3CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为92%，并在反应过程中持续增加。值得注意的是，10CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为零，表明最初只发生副反应。之后，丙烯选择性迅速增加到约92%的高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。三种催化剂的初始丙烷转化率分别为22%的Re10CoSiBeta、60%的Reox10CoSiBeta和85%的10CoSiBeta。在20分钟后，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率都达到约80%。所有初始丙烯选择性都为零，而值在10分钟内增加到92%的Re10CoSiBeta、70%的Reox10CoSiBeta和仅20%的10CoSiBeta。有趣的是，所有催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化活性(约80%)和丙烯选择性(约93%)，表明尽管初始状态不同，钴物种转化为相同的活性相。10CoSiBeta催化剂在不同条件下预处理的Co2p XPS光谱确认大块Co3O4的存在。经过还原氧化处理后，出现了一个新的峰，位于780.2 eV，归因于还原产生的金属Co。Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2峰之间的双重分离减少到15.3 eV，加上786.8和803.6 eV的强烈卫星峰，表明Reox10CoSiBeta中存在Co0和Co2+。10CoSiBeta中的Co物种也可以在反应条件下还原。TEM图像显示，10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta的平均粒径分别为11.48和7.67 nm。Reox10CoSiBeta的XRD图案证明了金属Co的存在。H2 TPR曲线显示，Reox10CoSiBeta中Co3O4的还原峰大大减少，弱峰归因于新形成的CoOx的还原。金属Co的初始含量不同，顺序为10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化性能，尽管钴的粒径和初始化学状态不同，这表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后具有相同的活性位点。大块Co3O4颗粒导致严重的副反应，这是10CoSiBeta初始丙烯选择性极低的原因。经过预还原处理后，所有表面Co3O4颗粒被还原为大块Co0颗粒，最初显示出Re10CoSiBeta的丙烷转化率很低，这意味着大块Co对PDH几乎不活跃，只会导致碳沉积。对于3CoSiBeta催化剂观察到的Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2的结合能证实，主要是Co(II)物种(在限制的CoOx中)，而非常少的表面Co(III)物种(在Co3O4中)会影响初始催化性能。再生0.5CoSiBeta的催化活性几乎与新鲜催化剂在四个循环中获得的催化活性相同，表明失活主要是由碳沉积而不是钴烧结引起的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的TOF值最高，达到32.9 h1，在550°C下对PDH反应，远高于先前报道的值。同时，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性也是最高的，值超过97%。在相同的反应条件下，0.5Co/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能(仅5%丙烷转化率)比0.5CoSiBeta弱得多。减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，同时也证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。由限制的CoOx还原产生的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的巨大催化活性，以及理想的可重用性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species. The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD.

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，并用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。与Pt@NaX催化剂中Pt簇粘附在X-沸石内部相比，Pt/NaX催化剂中Pt簇位于X-沸石外部，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高。此外，在反应18小时后，Pt/NaX中检测到较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是Pt簇的电子状态、周围的沸石框架和沸石笼的扩散效应。被限制在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心受到周围沸石负框架的显著调节，降低到较低的值，而d带中心较低的Pt簇不利于丙烷的活化。围绕封闭Pt簇的沸石框架抑制了丙烯的解吸，降低了其选择性，增加了反应过程中的焦炭沉积。显著的钝化效应主要归因于封闭Pt簇周围的沸石框架，它降低了Pt簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷的活化，阻止了丙烯的解吸，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。", "Doi": "10.1039/D1CY00738F"},

Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。催化剂的最优操作条件是温度585 C，小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，Sn含量从1 wt%增加会不利地影响催化剂的性能。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，帮助减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。SAPO-34载体的制备涉及将Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O以特定的摩尔比混合。通过顺序浸渍煅烧的SAPO-34与SnCl2·2H2O和H2PtCl6溶液来制备双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，以实现所需的Sn和Pt负载量。XRD图案证实了催化剂的结构，而XRF测量验证了金属含量。BET表面积测量和TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成方面的见解。IR光谱用于研究催化剂的酸性。PtSn基催化剂的脱氢性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。在丙烷脱氢过程中，Pt的聚集是催化剂失活的主要原因，但Sn有助于在催化剂制备过程中分散Pt，从而提高催化性能。Sn通过改变金属与载体之间的界面特性来修改表面Pt集合体，并促进金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移。丙烷脱氢的最优操作条件为585 C、WHSV为5.6 h1、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25和14-25%的转化范围。Sn的存在在一定限度内（1 wt %）提高了催化性能，但超过这个限度，它会降低反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有重大影响。XRD图案显示，Pt和Sn的掺入并未改变SAPO-34沸石载体的原始结构/拓扑。由于Pt和Sn的浓度较低，无法观察到它们的峰，但它们最初被认为是单分散的。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高逐渐降低，这可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF分析证实了金属的成功负载，而BET结果表明，金属掺入改变了催化剂的几何效应。随着Sn负载量的增加，表面积从419降低到396 m2/g，这是由于Sn和/或Pt堵塞了孔隙。Sn含量对催化剂的几何形状有重大影响。NH3-TPD和IR分析表明，Sn（0.8-1.2 wt %）的存在对催化剂的酸性几乎没有影响。峰向较低温度的小幅偏移表明酸强度略有下降。在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34中观察到最高的氨吸收量。在增加Sn负载量后，峰强度的小幅下降减少了Bronsted酸位的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，并提高了反应向更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度（1.2 wt %）下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位，即使在较高酸性下，转化率也较低。H2-TPR结果表明，Sn的存在改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度（从1 wt %）导致Sn0物种的形成。在较高温度下的还原峰表明，在Sn存在下，Pt与载体之间有良好的相互作用。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高和宽度增加，这可能是由于Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的联合还原和有价值的相互作用。增加的Sn负载量将较高温度峰向较低还原温度偏移，表明Sn0物种的形成。直接锚定在SAPO-34上的Pt位点对脱氢不活跃，但附着在SnOx上的Pt被认为对反应有活性。Sn的存在促进了金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移，这只有在金属与载体良好相互作用时才可能发生。Sn通过降低表面积和减少碳-金属键/相互作用来修改Pt集合体，使中间体容易移动到载体上。Sn的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭形成反应来减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction.\"\n          [39] \"The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.\"", "English": "The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。CoOx物种在脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石中被限制在T位点(硅醇)中，在H2或反应气体下可发展成超小Co颗粒，对催化PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。已识别出高度分散的CoOx物种，易于还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta载体创建的T位点(硅醇)中。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，但不同的诱导期，表明在反应中形成的金属Co是活性位点。在600°C下，SiBeta沸石中0.5 wt%的Co显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，丙烷转化率约为72%，丙烯选择性超过92%，远优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度预示着长期的实用性，据报道，Co对PDH具有一定的催化活性。Co(II)对丙烷CH活化的催化能力由Coperet等人提出。胡等人报道，硅基单位点Co2+对丙烯具有高度选择性，并提出了一种涉及单位点Co2+位点上异裂CH键的非氧化还原机制。随后，他们提出，CoAl2O4中作为Lewis酸性位点的四面体Co2+物种也是PDH反应中的活性位点。小金属Co颗粒被限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而SiBeta载体上的大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒分别导致裂解和碳沉积。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出相当大的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。钴物种主要以CoOx的形式存在于0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的T位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过600°C下1小时的预还原处理，其催化性能都非常相似，尽管诱导期不同，这表明限制的CoOx可以在反应中还原为金属Co。随着Co负载量的增加，初始丙烷转化率从0.5CoSiBeta的40%增加到10CoSiBeta的86%。0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta催化剂的最大丙烷转化率分别约为53、59、80和81%。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性非常高且稳定，在整个反应中稳定在约98%。3CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为92%，并在反应过程中持续增加。值得注意的是，10CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为零，表明最初只发生副反应。之后，丙烯选择性迅速增加到约92%的高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。三种催化剂的初始丙烷转化率分别为22%的Re10CoSiBeta、60%的Reox10CoSiBeta和85%的10CoSiBeta。在20分钟后，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率都达到约80%。所有初始丙烯选择性都为零，而值在10分钟内增加到92%的Re10CoSiBeta、70%的Reox10CoSiBeta和仅20%的10CoSiBeta。有趣的是，所有催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化活性(约80%)和丙烯选择性(约93%)，表明尽管初始状态不同，钴物种转化为相同的活性相。10CoSiBeta催化剂在不同条件下预处理的Co2p XPS光谱确认大块Co3O4的存在。经过还原氧化处理后，出现了一个新的峰，位于780.2 eV，归因于还原产生的金属Co。Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2峰之间的双重分离减少到15.3 eV，加上786.8和803.6 eV的强烈卫星峰，表明Reox10CoSiBeta中存在Co0和Co2+。10CoSiBeta中的Co物种也可以在反应条件下还原。TEM图像显示，10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta的平均粒径分别为11.48和7.67 nm。Reox10CoSiBeta的XRD图案证明了金属Co的存在。H2 TPR曲线显示，Reox10CoSiBeta中Co3O4的还原峰大大减少，弱峰归因于新形成的CoOx的还原。金属Co的初始含量不同，顺序为10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化性能，尽管钴的粒径和初始化学状态不同，这表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后具有相同的活性位点。大块Co3O4颗粒导致严重的副反应，这是10CoSiBeta初始丙烯选择性极低的原因。经过预还原处理后，所有表面Co3O4颗粒被还原为大块Co0颗粒，最初显示出Re10CoSiBeta的丙烷转化率很低，这意味着大块Co对PDH几乎不活跃，只会导致碳沉积。对于3CoSiBeta催化剂观察到的Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2的结合能证实，主要是Co(II)物种(在限制的CoOx中)，而非常少的表面Co(III)物种(在Co3O4中)会影响初始催化性能。再生0.5CoSiBeta的催化活性几乎与新鲜催化剂在四个循环中获得的催化活性相同，表明失活主要是由碳沉积而不是钴烧结引起的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的TOF值最高，达到32.9 h1，在550°C下对PDH反应，远高于先前报道的值。同时，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性也是最高的，值超过97%。在相同的反应条件下，0.5Co/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能(仅5%丙烷转化率)比0.5CoSiBeta弱得多。减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，同时也证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。由限制的CoOx还原产生的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的巨大催化活性，以及理想的可重用性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

The literature does not provide specific information on how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it detail the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The literature does not provide information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites results in highly dispersed ZnO species, which improves the activities of both zeolites in propane conversion. The type and strength of acid sites on the parent and the ALD ZnO modified zeolites play a crucial role in the reaction pathways. Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites, while on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5, the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed. The isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics. The pore size and topology of the zeolites also affect the distribution of ZnO species and the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. For ZSM-5, the precursor molecules could only infiltrate the micropores during the first ALD cycle, while for Y zeolite, the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO物种引入ZSM-5和Y沸石中，增强了丙烷转化的催化活性。沸石的拓扑结构，如孔径和结构，影响前体的可及性和活性物种的分布。组成，特别是ZnO的负载和形式，影响选择性和转化率。孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比更大的ZnO簇更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃。催化剂的稳定性受到诸如焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO沉积到ZSM-5和Y沸石上，可以提高丙烯的选择性和转化率。ALD过程允许对ZnO团簇的大小和分布进行精确控制，这影响催化活性和稳定性。提高性能的关键因素包括存在孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，这些物种对丙烷转化更有效，以及脱氢和后续反应之间的平衡，后者需要Brønsted酸位。催化剂稳定性受焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。文献没有提供具体信息，说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，也没有详细说明提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素，对于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石尤其如此。文献没有提供关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂(特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石)在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，以及提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素的信息。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO沉积到ZSM-5和Y沸石上，形成高度分散的ZnO物种，从而提高了这两种沸石在丙烷转化中的活性。母体和ALD ZnO改性沸石上酸位点的类型和强度在反应途径中起着关键作用。通过ALD将ZnO掺入Y沸石中，完全消除了Brnsted酸位点，增加了强Lewis酸位点的数量，而在ALD ZnO改性的ZSM-5上，Brnsted酸位点仅部分被去除。在ZnO ALD的第一周期后，在这两种沸石上形成的孤立Zn(OH)+物种对丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃更有效。沸石的孔径和拓扑结构也影响ZnO物种的分布和反应物到达活性位点的可及性。对于ZSM-5，前体分子只能在第一个ALD周期中渗透到微孔中，而对于Y沸石，前体分子可以在ZnO ALD的前三个周期中渗透到微孔中。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括ZnO物种的分散和形式、酸位点的类型和强度以及沸石的孔结构。", "Doi": "10.1039/C5CP05043J"},

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，并用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。与Pt@NaX催化剂中Pt簇粘附在X-沸石内部相比，Pt/NaX催化剂中Pt簇位于X-沸石外部，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高。此外，在反应18小时后，Pt/NaX中检测到较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是Pt簇的电子状态、周围的沸石框架和沸石笼的扩散效应。被限制在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心受到周围沸石负框架的显著调节，降低到较低的值，而d带中心较低的Pt簇不利于丙烷的活化。围绕封闭Pt簇的沸石框架抑制了丙烯的解吸，降低了其选择性，增加了反应过程中的焦炭沉积。显著的钝化效应主要归因于封闭Pt簇周围的沸石框架，它降低了Pt簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷的活化，阻止了丙烯的解吸，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。", "Doi": "10.1039/D1CY00738F"},

The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。催化剂的最优操作条件是温度585 C，小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，Sn含量从1 wt%增加会不利地影响催化剂的性能。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，帮助减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。SAPO-34载体的制备涉及将Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O以特定的摩尔比混合。通过顺序浸渍煅烧的SAPO-34与SnCl2·2H2O和H2PtCl6溶液来制备双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，以实现所需的Sn和Pt负载量。XRD图案证实了催化剂的结构，而XRF测量验证了金属含量。BET表面积测量和TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成方面的见解。IR光谱用于研究催化剂的酸性。PtSn基催化剂的脱氢性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。在丙烷脱氢过程中，Pt的聚集是催化剂失活的主要原因，但Sn有助于在催化剂制备过程中分散Pt，从而提高催化性能。Sn通过改变金属与载体之间的界面特性来修改表面Pt集合体，并促进金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移。丙烷脱氢的最优操作条件为585 C、WHSV为5.6 h1、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25和14-25%的转化范围。Sn的存在在一定限度内（1 wt %）提高了催化性能，但超过这个限度，它会降低反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有重大影响。XRD图案显示，Pt和Sn的掺入并未改变SAPO-34沸石载体的原始结构/拓扑。由于Pt和Sn的浓度较低，无法观察到它们的峰，但它们最初被认为是单分散的。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高逐渐降低，这可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF分析证实了金属的成功负载，而BET结果表明，金属掺入改变了催化剂的几何效应。随着Sn负载量的增加，表面积从419降低到396 m2/g，这是由于Sn和/或Pt堵塞了孔隙。Sn含量对催化剂的几何形状有重大影响。NH3-TPD和IR分析表明，Sn（0.8-1.2 wt %）的存在对催化剂的酸性几乎没有影响。峰向较低温度的小幅偏移表明酸强度略有下降。在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34中观察到最高的氨吸收量。在增加Sn负载量后，峰强度的小幅下降减少了Bronsted酸位的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，并提高了反应向更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度（1.2 wt %）下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位，即使在较高酸性下，转化率也较低。H2-TPR结果表明，Sn的存在改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度（从1 wt %）导致Sn0物种的形成。在较高温度下的还原峰表明，在Sn存在下，Pt与载体之间有良好的相互作用。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高和宽度增加，这可能是由于Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的联合还原和有价值的相互作用。增加的Sn负载量将较高温度峰向较低还原温度偏移，表明Sn0物种的形成。直接锚定在SAPO-34上的Pt位点对脱氢不活跃，但附着在SnOx上的Pt被认为对反应有活性。Sn的存在促进了金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移，这只有在金属与载体良好相互作用时才可能发生。Sn通过降低表面积和减少碳-金属键/相互作用来修改Pt集合体，使中间体容易移动到载体上。Sn的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭形成反应来减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1021/ie901465s"},

The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。CoOx物种在脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石中被限制在T位点(硅醇)中，在H2或反应气体下可发展成超小Co颗粒，对催化PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。已识别出高度分散的CoOx物种，易于还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta载体创建的T位点(硅醇)中。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，但不同的诱导期，表明在反应中形成的金属Co是活性位点。在600°C下，SiBeta沸石中0.5 wt%的Co显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，丙烷转化率约为72%，丙烯选择性超过92%，远优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度预示着长期的实用性，据报道，Co对PDH具有一定的催化活性。Co(II)对丙烷CH活化的催化能力由Coperet等人提出。胡等人报道，硅基单位点Co2+对丙烯具有高度选择性，并提出了一种涉及单位点Co2+位点上异裂CH键的非氧化还原机制。随后，他们提出，CoAl2O4中作为Lewis酸性位点的四面体Co2+物种也是PDH反应中的活性位点。小金属Co颗粒被限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而SiBeta载体上的大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒分别导致裂解和碳沉积。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出相当大的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。钴物种主要以CoOx的形式存在于0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的T位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过600°C下1小时的预还原处理，其催化性能都非常相似，尽管诱导期不同，这表明限制的CoOx可以在反应中还原为金属Co。随着Co负载量的增加，初始丙烷转化率从0.5CoSiBeta的40%增加到10CoSiBeta的86%。0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta催化剂的最大丙烷转化率分别约为53、59、80和81%。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性非常高且稳定，在整个反应中稳定在约98%。3CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为92%，并在反应过程中持续增加。值得注意的是，10CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为零，表明最初只发生副反应。之后，丙烯选择性迅速增加到约92%的高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。三种催化剂的初始丙烷转化率分别为22%的Re10CoSiBeta、60%的Reox10CoSiBeta和85%的10CoSiBeta。在20分钟后，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率都达到约80%。所有初始丙烯选择性都为零，而值在10分钟内增加到92%的Re10CoSiBeta、70%的Reox10CoSiBeta和仅20%的10CoSiBeta。有趣的是，所有催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化活性(约80%)和丙烯选择性(约93%)，表明尽管初始状态不同，钴物种转化为相同的活性相。10CoSiBeta催化剂在不同条件下预处理的Co2p XPS光谱确认大块Co3O4的存在。经过还原氧化处理后，出现了一个新的峰，位于780.2 eV，归因于还原产生的金属Co。Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2峰之间的双重分离减少到15.3 eV，加上786.8和803.6 eV的强烈卫星峰，表明Reox10CoSiBeta中存在Co0和Co2+。10CoSiBeta中的Co物种也可以在反应条件下还原。TEM图像显示，10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta的平均粒径分别为11.48和7.67 nm。Reox10CoSiBeta的XRD图案证明了金属Co的存在。H2 TPR曲线显示，Reox10CoSiBeta中Co3O4的还原峰大大减少，弱峰归因于新形成的CoOx的还原。金属Co的初始含量不同，顺序为10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化性能，尽管钴的粒径和初始化学状态不同，这表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后具有相同的活性位点。大块Co3O4颗粒导致严重的副反应，这是10CoSiBeta初始丙烯选择性极低的原因。经过预还原处理后，所有表面Co3O4颗粒被还原为大块Co0颗粒，最初显示出Re10CoSiBeta的丙烷转化率很低，这意味着大块Co对PDH几乎不活跃，只会导致碳沉积。对于3CoSiBeta催化剂观察到的Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2的结合能证实，主要是Co(II)物种(在限制的CoOx中)，而非常少的表面Co(III)物种(在Co3O4中)会影响初始催化性能。再生0.5CoSiBeta的催化活性几乎与新鲜催化剂在四个循环中获得的催化活性相同，表明失活主要是由碳沉积而不是钴烧结引起的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的TOF值最高，达到32.9 h1，在550°C下对PDH反应，远高于先前报道的值。同时，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性也是最高的，值超过97%。在相同的反应条件下，0.5Co/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能(仅5%丙烷转化率)比0.5CoSiBeta弱得多。减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，同时也证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。由限制的CoOx还原产生的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的巨大催化活性，以及理想的可重用性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},

Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.", "Chinese": "制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，并用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。与Pt@NaX催化剂中Pt簇粘附在X-沸石内部相比，Pt/NaX催化剂中Pt簇位于X-沸石外部，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高。此外，在反应18小时后，Pt/NaX中检测到较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是Pt簇的电子状态、周围的沸石框架和沸石笼的扩散效应。被限制在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心受到周围沸石负框架的显著调节，降低到较低的值，而d带中心较低的Pt簇不利于丙烷的活化。围绕封闭Pt簇的沸石框架抑制了丙烯的解吸，降低了其选择性，增加了反应过程中的焦炭沉积。显著的钝化效应主要归因于封闭Pt簇周围的沸石框架，它降低了Pt簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷的活化，阻止了丙烯的解吸，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。", "Doi": "10.1039/D1CY00738F"},

PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support.

"The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition.

The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first.

The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance.

The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH.

PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support.

"The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition.

The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first.

The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance.

The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH.

PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream.

The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. However, an increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, which improves catalyst stability. The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities. H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support.

"The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition.

The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first.

The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance.

The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH.
