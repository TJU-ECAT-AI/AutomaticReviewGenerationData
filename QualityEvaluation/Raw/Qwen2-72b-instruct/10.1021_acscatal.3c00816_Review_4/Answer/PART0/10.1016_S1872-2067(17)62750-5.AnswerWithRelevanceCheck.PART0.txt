          [1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
          [3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
          [4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."
          [5] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [6] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
          [7] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
          [8] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
          [9] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能有重大影响。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，表现出更高的活性和更好的稳定性，这是由于其外部表面有更多Pt，这减少了因碳沉积堵塞沸石孔隙而导致的Pt失活。相比之下，PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中Sn氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用因ZSM-5的弱酸性而减弱，导致Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括Pt在多孔支撑物上的分布、沸石的酸性和Pt、Sn与支撑物之间的相互作用。
