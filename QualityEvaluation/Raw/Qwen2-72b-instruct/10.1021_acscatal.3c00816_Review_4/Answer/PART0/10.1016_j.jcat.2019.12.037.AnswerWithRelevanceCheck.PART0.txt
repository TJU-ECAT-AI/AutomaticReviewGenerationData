          [1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
          [4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
          [7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
          [8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."
          [10] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
          [11] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [12] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
          [13] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [14] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
          [15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
          [16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
          [17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
          [18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
          [19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
          [20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
          [21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
          [22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
          [23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
          [24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
          [25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
          [26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
          [27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
          [28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
          [29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
          [30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
          [31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
          [32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
          [33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
          [34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
          [35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."
          [36] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
          [37] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
          [38] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
          [39] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for catalyzing PDH to propylene. The highly dispersed CoOx species are easily reducible and can be reduced to metallic Co in situ during the reaction, acting as active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for long-term utility. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane and the selectivity of silica-supported single-site Co2+ toward propylene have been proposed. The tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 are also active sites in PDH. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments is similar, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, and the maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. The initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4. After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction. The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta. The Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions. The TEM images show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta evidences the presence of metallic Co. The H2 TPR profiles show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst confirm there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. The 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirms the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability.

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。CoOx物种在脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石中被限制在T位点(硅醇)中，在H2或反应气体下可发展成超小Co颗粒，对催化PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。已识别出高度分散的CoOx物种，易于还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta载体创建的T位点(硅醇)中。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，但不同的诱导期，表明在反应中形成的金属Co是活性位点。在600°C下，SiBeta沸石中0.5 wt%的Co显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，丙烷转化率约为72%，丙烯选择性超过92%，远优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度预示着长期的实用性，据报道，Co对PDH具有一定的催化活性。Co(II)对丙烷CH活化的催化能力由Coperet等人提出。胡等人报道，硅基单位点Co2+对丙烯具有高度选择性，并提出了一种涉及单位点Co2+位点上异裂CH键的非氧化还原机制。随后，他们提出，CoAl2O4中作为Lewis酸性位点的四面体Co2+物种也是PDH反应中的活性位点。小金属Co颗粒被限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而SiBeta载体上的大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒分别导致裂解和碳沉积。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出相当大的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。钴物种主要以CoOx的形式存在于0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的T位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过600°C下1小时的预还原处理，其催化性能都非常相似，尽管诱导期不同，这表明限制的CoOx可以在反应中还原为金属Co。随着Co负载量的增加，初始丙烷转化率从0.5CoSiBeta的40%增加到10CoSiBeta的86%。0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta催化剂的最大丙烷转化率分别约为53、59、80和81%。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性非常高且稳定，在整个反应中稳定在约98%。3CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为92%，并在反应过程中持续增加。值得注意的是，10CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为零，表明最初只发生副反应。之后，丙烯选择性迅速增加到约92%的高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。三种催化剂的初始丙烷转化率分别为22%的Re10CoSiBeta、60%的Reox10CoSiBeta和85%的10CoSiBeta。在20分钟后，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率都达到约80%。所有初始丙烯选择性都为零，而值在10分钟内增加到92%的Re10CoSiBeta、70%的Reox10CoSiBeta和仅20%的10CoSiBeta。有趣的是，所有催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化活性(约80%)和丙烯选择性(约93%)，表明尽管初始状态不同，钴物种转化为相同的活性相。10CoSiBeta催化剂在不同条件下预处理的Co2p XPS光谱确认大块Co3O4的存在。经过还原氧化处理后，出现了一个新的峰，位于780.2 eV，归因于还原产生的金属Co。Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2峰之间的双重分离减少到15.3 eV，加上786.8和803.6 eV的强烈卫星峰，表明Reox10CoSiBeta中存在Co0和Co2+。10CoSiBeta中的Co物种也可以在反应条件下还原。TEM图像显示，10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta的平均粒径分别为11.48和7.67 nm。Reox10CoSiBeta的XRD图案证明了金属Co的存在。H2 TPR曲线显示，Reox10CoSiBeta中Co3O4的还原峰大大减少，弱峰归因于新形成的CoOx的还原。金属Co的初始含量不同，顺序为10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化性能，尽管钴的粒径和初始化学状态不同，这表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后具有相同的活性位点。大块Co3O4颗粒导致严重的副反应，这是10CoSiBeta初始丙烯选择性极低的原因。经过预还原处理后，所有表面Co3O4颗粒被还原为大块Co0颗粒，最初显示出Re10CoSiBeta的丙烷转化率很低，这意味着大块Co对PDH几乎不活跃，只会导致碳沉积。对于3CoSiBeta催化剂观察到的Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2的结合能证实，主要是Co(II)物种(在限制的CoOx中)，而非常少的表面Co(III)物种(在Co3O4中)会影响初始催化性能。再生0.5CoSiBeta的催化活性几乎与新鲜催化剂在四个循环中获得的催化活性相同，表明失活主要是由碳沉积而不是钴烧结引起的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的TOF值最高，达到32.9 h1，在550°C下对PDH反应，远高于先前报道的值。同时，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性也是最高的，值超过97%。在相同的反应条件下，0.5Co/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能(仅5%丙烷转化率)比0.5CoSiBeta弱得多。减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，同时也证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。由限制的CoOx还原产生的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的巨大催化活性，以及理想的可重用性。
