        The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology, as highlighted in a series of studies \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\], \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\], \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\], \[10.1039/D1CY00738F\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\], \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\], \[10.1021/ie901465s\], \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\], \[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\], \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\].
        A PtSn-based catalyst supported on SAPO-34, prepared by sequential impregnation, achieved 94% propylene selectivity and >97% total olefins selectivity in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\]. This superior performance was attributed to SAPO-34's larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity, which were not altered by metal doping. The catalyst outperformed PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions, highlighting the importance of zeolite topology and composition in PDH reactions.
        Dealuminated Î² zeolite, supporting small ZnO nanoclusters, serves as a high-performance catalyst for PDH, achieving initial propane conversion of 53% and propylene selectivity of 93% \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\]. Dealumination suppresses side reactions by eliminating strong acid sites, enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst exhibits high stability and reusability, making it a promising choice for PDH applications.
        Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn in the BEA framework, excels in PDH, achieving high selectivity, activity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acid sites and lowest B/L ratio, offers optimal PDH performance, converting 40% propane to 92% propylene. Theoretical calculations confirm dehydrogenation on Lewis acid sites and the direct pathway's feasibility. Sn-Beta zeolites maintain stability under harsh conditions for 72 hours, showcasing potential for advanced PDH catalysts.
        Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances catalytic activity for propane conversion in PDH reactions, improving propylene selectivity and conversion rates \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]. The dispersed ZnO species, particularly isolated Zn(OH)+, are more effective for propane conversion. The pore size and topology of zeolites affect the distribution of ZnO species and reactants' accessibility. Key factors for improved performance include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites. Catalyst stability is influenced by coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species.
        In PDH reactions, the location of Pt clusters on X-zeolite significantly impacts catalytic performance \[10.1039/D1CY00738F\]. Pt/NaX, with exterior Pt clusters, shows a 1100% increase in TOF and improved propylene selectivity compared to Pt@NaX, where Pt clusters are inside the zeolite. Pt/NaX also exhibits less coke deposition and higher stability. The electronic state of Pt clusters, influenced by the zeolitic framework, and diffusion effects are key factors. Enclosed Pt clusters have a lower d-band center, reducing propane activation and propylene desorption, leading to decreased selectivity and increased coke deposition.
        In PDH reactions, zeolite-based catalysts' performance is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology \[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Optimal conversion and selectivity were achieved with Beta and mordenite zeolites, featuring nSi/nAl ratios >8.7 and 2.5 wt.% zinc content. The 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst exhibited stable conversion near thermodynamic equilibrium for 63 hours, with >90% propene selectivity. Zinc loading through impregnation or ion exchange affects activity and selectivity. Ion-exchanged zinc inhibits loss during experiments. The presence of various zinc species in zeolites impacts catalytic behavior. Catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintained stable performance with negligible zinc loss. Large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios showed consistent behavior regardless of zinc incorporation method.
        Preparation methods, composition, and topology significantly impact zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\]. Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation boosts Pt dispersion and reduces Zn loss, enhancing propylene selectivity and conversion. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, nearing thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination creates Si-Beta zeolites with abundant silanol nests, improving metal dispersion and stabilization. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts outperform Zn/Al-Beta in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity, improving propylene selectivity without affecting Lewis acidity. Direct PDH mechanism on -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically favorable. Encapsulated Pt species in Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions lead to high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent stability. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are active for PDH. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance.
        The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support \[10.1021/ie901465s\]. The support stabilizes the catalyst's activity, and the novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst offers better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. Optimal conditions include a temperature of 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h-1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, enhancing dispersion and facilitating carbon deposit transfer from metal sites to the support. However, excessive Sn (over 1 wt %) negatively impacts performance. Sn reduces coke deposition, improving catalyst stability. The preparation of SAPO-34 involves a specific molar ratio of Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O. Bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation. XRD, XRF, BET, TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's structure, metallic content, surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation. IR spectroscopy studies the acidity. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation causes catalyst deactivation, but Sn disperses Pt, enhancing catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character and facilitating carbon deposit transfer. Optimal operating conditions are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h-1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. Sn up to 1 wt % improves performance, but beyond this, it diminishes the reaction rate. Sn content significantly impacts catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. XRD patterns show the original SAPO-34 structure is unaltered. Peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to low concentration, but they are initially monodispersed. Peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to surface character changes. XRF confirms successful metal loading, and BET results indicate metallic incorporation modifies the catalyst's geometry. Surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking. Sn has a significant impact on catalyst geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal negligible effects of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) on acidity. The highest ammonia uptake is at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. Increased Sn loading reduces peak intensities, decreasing Bronsted acid site intensity, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion. H2-TPR shows Sn improves Pt reduction properties, while higher Sn concentration leads to Sn0 species formation. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds, improving catalyst stability.
        An improved post-synthesis strategy for PDH catalysts involves dealumination of H-beta followed by metal impregnation, leading to Sn incorporation into Si-beta's tetrahedral coordination states \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]. This promotes high dispersion of Pt nanoclusters due to strong Pt-Sn(IV) interactions. Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show high propene formation rates and selectivity. Strong PtSn interactions and Sn confinement in Si-beta framework prevent coke formation and Pt sintering, ensuring stable dehydrogenation and regeneration with consistent activity over multiple cycles.
        In PDH reactions, VOx catalysts on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) exhibit catalytic activity proportional to the amount of acidic sites generated from VOx-SiBeta interaction \[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\]. Propylene selectivity and deactivation rate increase with higher V loading, demonstrating the critical role of VOx aggregation in performance.
        Encapsulating subnanometric clusters in zeolite pores boosts stability and catalytic applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]. Framework-Sn in Beta zeolite anchors Pt precursors, forming Pt@Sn-Beta. This catalyst exhibits high stability in PDH, maintaining 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity, due to zeolite pore restrictions and Sn's electronic effect inhibiting coke formation and Pt cluster sintering.
        In PDH reactions, CoOx confined in T-sites of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite forms ultrasmall Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, enhancing catalytic efficiency \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity, high propane conversion, and selectivity, outperforming other Co catalysts and matching industrial standards. Co's earth abundance and reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising long-term utility candidate. Co(II) activates CH bonds in propane, and single-site Co2+ on silica supports propylene selectivity. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrates high catalytic activity and selectivity, with the induction period shortened after reduction treatment. The Co species are mainly CoOx at the T-sites, and confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst's catalytic activity and selectivity are comparable to those of other catalysts after 0.5 h on stream, indicating similar active phases regardless of initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra confirm the presence of metallic Co after reduction-oxidation treatment. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows ideal reusability and high TOF values for PDH, with propylene selectivity above 97%. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, showing great catalytic activity and high product selectivity.
        In PDH reactions, PtSnNa/SUZ-4 outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to greater Pt availability on the external surface, reducing deactivation by carbon deposition \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]. The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 leads to easier reduction of Sn oxides, decreasing catalytic activity. SUZ-4's strong acid sites prevent Pt precursor penetration, while ZSM-5's weak sites allow deeper Pt dispersion, affecting activity. Propylene selectivity, conversion, and stability are enhanced by Pt distribution, zeolite acidity, and Pt-Sn-support interactions.
