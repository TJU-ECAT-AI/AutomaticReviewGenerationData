Optimal conditions include 585 C temperature, 5.6 h-1 WHSV, 0.25 H2/C3H8 ratio, and 14-25% conversion. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, enhancing dispersion and facilitating carbon deposit transfer from metal sites to the support.

{"DOC": "In PDH reactions, the confinement of CoOx species in T-sites of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to ultrasmall Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, enhancing PDH efficiency. CoSiBeta catalysts, particularly with 0.5 wt% Co, exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity, surpassing other Co catalysts and matching industrial standards. Co's earth abundance and catalytic activity for PDH make it a viable long-term option. CoOx species, easily reducible to metallic Co in situ, act as active sites. Higher Co loadings increase initial propane conversion, but propylene selectivity is optimal at lower loadings. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows high catalytic activity and selectivity, with a shortened induction period after reduction treatment. Co species are mainly CoOx at T-sites. Catalysts with and without prereduction treatments have similar performance, indicating in situ reduction of CoOx to metallic Co. The 10CoSiBeta catalyst initially exhibits side reactions, but propylene selectivity increases, suggesting PDH predominance. After 0.5 h on stream, all tested catalysts show similar activity and selectivity, indicating transformation into the same active phases. Small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst maintains activity over four cycles, indicating deactivation by carbon deposits, not cobalt sintering. Its TOF value for PDH at 550 C is the highest reported, with over 97% propylene selectivity, outperforming a 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst. Decreasing catalyst mass reduces activity, confirming the intrinsic activity of 0.5CoSiBeta for PDH.

Isolated Zn(OH)+ species, formed after the first ALD cycle, are more effective for propane conversion than larger ZnO clusters. ALD allows precise control over ZnO size and distribution, impacting catalytic activity and stability. The type and strength of acid sites, influenced by ALD, play a crucial role in reaction pathways. Pore size and topology affect precursor infiltration and reactant accessibility, with ZSM-5 micropores accessed during the first cycle and Y zeolite micropores during the first three cycles.
