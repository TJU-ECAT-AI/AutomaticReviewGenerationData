The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology, as highlighted in a series of studies \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\], \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\], \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\], \[10.1039/D1CY00738F\], \[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\], \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\], \[10.1021/ie901465s\], \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\], \[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\], \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\], \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\].

A PtSn-based catalyst supported on SAPO-34, prepared by sequential impregnation, achieved 94% propylene selectivity and >97% total olefins selectivity in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\]. This superior performance was attributed to SAPO-34's larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity, which were not altered by metal doping. The catalyst outperformed PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions, highlighting the importance of zeolite topology and composition in PDH reactions.

Dealuminated β zeolite, supporting small ZnO nanoclusters, serves as a high-performance catalyst for PDH, achieving initial propane conversion of 53% and propylene selectivity of 93% \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\]. Dealumination suppresses side reactions by eliminating strong acid sites, enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst exhibits high stability and reusability, making it a promising choice for PDH applications.

Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn in the BEA framework, excels in PDH, achieving high selectivity, activity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acid sites and lowest B/L ratio, offers optimal PDH performance, converting 40% propane to 92% propylene. Theoretical calculations confirm dehydrogenation on Lewis acid sites and the direct pathway's feasibility. Sn-Beta zeolites maintain stability under harsh conditions for 72 hours, showcasing potential for advanced PDH catalysts.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances catalytic activity for propane conversion in PDH reactions, improving propylene selectivity and conversion rates \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]. The dispersed ZnO species, particularly isolated Zn(OH)+, are more effective for propane conversion. The pore size and topology of zeolites affect the distribution of ZnO species and reactants' accessibility. Key factors for improved performance include the dispersion and form of ZnO species, the type and strength of acid sites, and the pore structure of the zeolites. Catalyst stability is influenced by coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species.

In PDH reactions, the location of Pt clusters on X-zeolite significantly impacts catalytic performance \[10.1039/D1CY00738F\]. Pt/NaX, with exterior Pt clusters, shows a 1100% increase in TOF and improved propylene selectivity compared to Pt@NaX, where Pt clusters are inside the zeolite. Pt/NaX also exhibits less coke deposition and higher stability. The electronic state of Pt clusters, influenced by the zeolitic framework, and diffusion effects are key factors. Enclosed Pt clusters have a lower d-band center, reducing propane activation and propylene desorption, leading to decreased selectivity and increased coke deposition.

In PDH reactions, zeolite-based catalysts' performance is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology \[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Optimal conversion and selectivity were achieved with Beta and mordenite zeolites, featuring nSi/nAl ratios >8.7 and 2.5 wt.% zinc content. The 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst exhibited stable conversion near thermodynamic equilibrium for 63 hours, with >90% propene selectivity. Zinc loading through impregnation or ion exchange affects activity and selectivity. Ion-exchanged zinc inhibits loss during experiments. The presence of various zinc species in zeolites impacts catalytic behavior. Catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintained stable performance with negligible zinc loss. Large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios showed consistent behavior regardless of zinc incorporation method.

Preparation methods, composition, and topology significantly impact zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\]. Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation boosts Pt dispersion and reduces Zn loss, enhancing propylene selectivity and conversion. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, nearing thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination creates Si-Beta zeolites with abundant silanol nests, improving metal dispersion and stabilization. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts outperform Zn/Al-Beta in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity, improving propylene selectivity without affecting Lewis acidity. Direct PDH mechanism on -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically favorable. Encapsulated Pt species in Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions lead to high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent stability. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are active for PDH. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance.

The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support \[10.1021/ie901465s\]. The support stabilizes the catalyst's activity, and the novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst offers better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. Optimal conditions include a temperature of 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h-1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, enhancing dispersion and facilitating carbon deposit transfer from metal sites to the support. However, excessive Sn (over 1 wt %) negatively impacts performance. Sn reduces coke deposition, improving catalyst stability. The preparation of SAPO-34 involves a specific molar ratio of Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O. Bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation. XRD, XRF, BET, TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's structure, metallic content, surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation. IR spectroscopy studies the acidity. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation causes catalyst deactivation, but Sn disperses Pt, enhancing catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character and facilitating carbon deposit transfer. Optimal operating conditions are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h-1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. Sn up to 1 wt % improves performance, but beyond this, it diminishes the reaction rate. Sn content significantly impacts catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. XRD patterns show the original SAPO-34 structure is unaltered. Peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to low concentration, but they are initially monodispersed. Peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to surface character changes. XRF confirms successful metal loading, and BET results indicate metallic incorporation modifies the catalyst's geometry. Surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking. Sn has a significant impact on catalyst geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal negligible effects of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) on acidity. The highest ammonia uptake is at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. Increased Sn loading reduces peak intensities, decreasing Bronsted acid site intensity, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion. H2-TPR shows Sn improves Pt reduction properties, while higher Sn concentration leads to Sn0 species formation. The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds, improving catalyst stability.

An improved post-synthesis strategy for PDH catalysts involves dealumination of H-beta followed by metal impregnation, leading to Sn incorporation into Si-beta's tetrahedral coordination states \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]. This promotes high dispersion of Pt nanoclusters due to strong Pt-Sn(IV) interactions. Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show high propene formation rates and selectivity. Strong PtSn interactions and Sn confinement in Si-beta framework prevent coke formation and Pt sintering, ensuring stable dehydrogenation and regeneration with consistent activity over multiple cycles.

In PDH reactions, VOx catalysts on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) exhibit catalytic activity proportional to the amount of acidic sites generated from VOx-SiBeta interaction \[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\]. Propylene selectivity and deactivation rate increase with higher V loading, demonstrating the critical role of VOx aggregation in performance.

Encapsulating subnanometric clusters in zeolite pores boosts stability and catalytic applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]. Framework-Sn in Beta zeolite anchors Pt precursors, forming Pt@Sn-Beta. This catalyst exhibits high stability in PDH, maintaining 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity, due to zeolite pore restrictions and Sn's electronic effect inhibiting coke formation and Pt cluster sintering.

In PDH reactions, CoOx confined in T-sites of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite forms ultrasmall Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, enhancing catalytic efficiency \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity, high propane conversion, and selectivity, outperforming other Co catalysts and matching industrial standards. Co's earth abundance and reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising long-term utility candidate. Co(II) activates CH bonds in propane, and single-site Co2+ on silica supports propylene selectivity. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrates high catalytic activity and selectivity, with the induction period shortened after reduction treatment. The Co species are mainly CoOx at the T-sites, and confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst's catalytic activity and selectivity are comparable to those of other catalysts after 0.5 h on stream, indicating similar active phases regardless of initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra confirm the presence of metallic Co after reduction-oxidation treatment. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows ideal reusability and high TOF values for PDH, with propylene selectivity above 97%. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, showing great catalytic activity and high product selectivity.

In PDH reactions, PtSnNa/SUZ-4 outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to greater Pt availability on the external surface, reducing deactivation by carbon deposition \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]. The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 leads to easier reduction of Sn oxides, decreasing catalytic activity. SUZ-4's strong acid sites prevent Pt precursor penetration, while ZSM-5's weak sites allow deeper Pt dispersion, affecting activity. Propylene selectivity, conversion, and stability are enhanced by Pt distribution, zeolite acidity, and Pt-Sn-support interactions.

通过顺序浸渍制备的PtSn基催化剂，以SAPO-34为载体，在PDH反应中实现了94%的丙烯选择性和>97%的总烯烃选择性\[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\]。这种优越的性能归因于SAPO-34的较大表面积、形状选择性和适宜的酸性，这些特性并未因金属掺杂而改变。在相同条件下，该催化剂的性能优于PtSn/ZSM-5，突出了沸石拓扑结构和组成在PDH反应中的重要性。

脱铝β沸石，支持小ZnO纳米簇，作为PDH的高性能催化剂，实现了53%的初始丙烷转化率和93%的丙烯选择性\[10.1002/cctc.201801708\]。脱铝作用通过消除强酸位点抑制了副反应，提高了催化活性和选择性。该催化剂具有高稳定性和可重复使用性，是PDH应用的有希望的选择。

Sn-Beta沸石，BEA框架中的单位点Sn，在PDH中表现出高选择性、活性和稳定性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂，具有最高的Lewis酸位点和最低的B/L比，提供了最佳的PDH性能，将40%的丙烷转化为92%的丙烯。理论计算确认了在Lewis酸位点上的脱氢作用和直接途径的可行性。Sn-Beta沸石在72小时内保持稳定，即使在恶劣条件下，展示了其作为高级PDH催化剂的潜力。

原子层沉积(ALD)在ZSM-5和Y沸石上沉积ZnO，增强了PDH反应中丙烷转化的催化活性，提高了丙烯选择性和转化率\[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]。分散的ZnO物种，特别是孤立的Zn(OH)+，对丙烷转化更有效。沸石的孔径和拓扑结构影响了ZnO物种的分布和反应物的可及性。改善性能的关键因素包括ZnO物种的分散和形式、酸位点的类型和强度以及沸石的孔结构。催化剂稳定性受焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO蒸发的影响。

在PDH反应中，X-沸石上Pt簇的位置对催化性能有显著影响\[10.1039/D1CY00738F\]。Pt/NaX，具有外部Pt簇，与Pt@NaX相比，Pt簇位于沸石内部，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性提高。Pt/NaX还表现出较少的焦炭沉积和更高的稳定性。Pt簇的电子状态受沸石框架的影响，扩散效应是关键因素。封闭的Pt簇具有较低的d带中心，降低了丙烷的活化和丙烯的解吸，导致选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。

在PDH反应中，沸石基催化剂的性能受到制备方法、组成和拓扑结构的显著影响\[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]。具有nSi/nAl比>8.7和2.5 wt.%锌含量的Beta和丝光沸石实现了最佳的转化和选择性。0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时内实现了接近热力学平衡的稳定转化，丙烯选择性超过90%。通过浸渍或离子交换的锌负载影响了活性和选择性。离子交换锌在实验中抑制了损失。沸石中各种锌物种的存在影响了催化行为。0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时内保持了稳定的性能，锌损失可忽略不计。大孔沸石在较低的nSi/nAl比下，无论锌的掺入方法如何，都表现出一致的行为。

制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对PDH反应中的沸石基催化剂有显著影响\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\]。Zn离子交换后Pt浸渍提高了Pt分散度，减少了Zn损失，提高了丙烯选择性和转化率。优化的PtZn-Beta催化剂实现了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择率，接近热力学平衡。脱铝作用创造了具有丰富硅醇巢的Si-Beta沸石，改善了金属分散度和稳定化。Zn/Si-Beta催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面优于Zn/Al-Beta。Sn-Beta催化剂的Na+掺杂削弱了Bronsted酸性，提高了丙烯选择性，而未影响Lewis酸性。直接PDH机制在-Sn-(OSi)4位点上是热力学上更有利的。由于强PtSn相互作用，Si-Beta通道中封装的Pt物种导致高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和优异的稳定性。Zn在Y沸石上的沉积消除了Bronsted酸位点，增加了强Lewis酸位点。孤立的Ga+/In+位点对PDH有活性。PtSn/SAPO-34由于更好的焦炭抗性，表现出比PtSn/ZSM-5更高的丙烯选择性和产量。

PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的显著影响\[10.1021/ie901465s\]。载体稳定了催化剂的活性，而新颖的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂为丙烷和丁烷脱氢至丙烯提供了更好的立体化学控制。最佳条件包括585 C的温度、5.6 h-1的WHSV、0.25的H2/C3H8摩尔比和14-25%的转化范围。Sn负载修改了表面Pt集合体，增强了分散度，促进了碳沉积从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，过量的Sn(超过1 wt %)对性能有负面影响。Sn减少了焦炭沉积，提高了催化剂的稳定性。SAPO-34的制备涉及Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O的特定摩尔比。通过顺序浸渍制备了双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂。XRD、XRF、BET、TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂结构、金属含量、表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成的见解。IR光谱研究了酸性。丙烷脱氢过程中Pt的聚集导致催化剂失活，但Sn分散了Pt，增强了催化性能。Sn修改了表面Pt集合体，改变了界面特性，促进了碳沉积的转移。最佳操作条件为585 C、5.6 h-1的WHSV、0.25的H2/C3H8摩尔比和14-25%的转化范围。Sn最多1 wt %提高了性能，但超过这个范围，它降低了反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有显著影响。XRD图案显示原始SAPO-34结构未改变。由于浓度低，未观察到Pt和Sn的峰，但它们最初是单分散的。随着Sn负载的增加，峰高降低，可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF确认了金属的成功负载，BET结果表明金属掺入修改了催化剂的几何形状。随着Sn负载的增加，表面积从419减少到396 m2/g，这是由于孔堵塞。Sn对催化剂几何形状有重大影响。NH3-TPD和IR分析显示Sn(0.8-1.2 wt %)对酸性有微小影响。最高的氨吸收发生在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34。增加Sn负载降低了峰强度，降低了Bronsted酸位点的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，提高了对更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度(1.2 wt %)下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位点，导致转化率低。H2-TPR显示Sn改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度导致Sn0物种的形成。Sn的存在促进了碳沉积从金属位点向载体的转移，使中间体容易转移到载体上。Sn通过减少表面积和碳-金属键，修改了Pt集合体，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

PDH催化剂的改进后合成策略涉及H-beta的脱铝，随后是金属浸渍，导致Sn被掺入Si-beta的四面体配位状态\[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]。这促进了由于强Pt-Sn(IV)相互作用而高度分散的Pt纳米簇。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂显示出高丙烯形成率和选择性。强PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制防止了焦炭形成和Pt团簇的烧结，确保了在多个循环中稳定脱氢和再生，活性一致。

在PDH反应中，VOx催化剂在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上，催化活性与VOx-SiBeta相互作用产生的酸位点数量成正比\[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\]。丙烯选择性和失活率随着V负载的增加而增加，展示了VOx聚集在性能中的关键作用。

将亚纳米级簇封装在沸石孔中，提高了稳定性和催化应用\[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]。Beta沸石中的框架Sn锚定了Pt前体，形成了Pt@Sn-Beta。该催化剂在PDH中表现出高稳定性，由于沸石孔限制和Sn的电子效应抑制了焦炭形成和Pt团簇的烧结，保持了90%的最大丙烷转化率超过250小时，丙烯选择率为99%。

在PDH反应中，CoOx在脱铝Beta(SiBeta)沸石的T位点被限制，形成了在H2或反应气体下超小Co颗粒，增强了催化效率\[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]。0.5 wt% Co的CoSiBeta催化剂显示出最先进的丙烯生产力、高丙烷转化率和选择性，优于其他Co催化剂，与工业标准相匹配。Co的地球丰度和报道的PDH催化活性使其成为有希望的长期效用候选者。Co(II)激活了丙烷中的CH键，而单位点Co2+在二氧化硅上支持丙烯选择性。在硅醇中被限制的微小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，而大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒促进了裂解和碳沉积。CoSiBeta催化剂表现出高催化活性和选择性，诱导期在还原处理后缩短。Co物种主要是在T位点的CoOx，被限制的CoOx可以在反应中还原为金属Co。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的催化活性和选择性与其他催化剂在0.5 h后相当，表明无论初始状态如何，都有相似的活性相。Co2p XPS光谱确认了还原-氧化处理后金属Co的存在。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂在PDH中显示出理想的可重复使用性和高TOF值，丙烯选择性超过97%。由被限制的CoOx还原产生的微小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出优异的催化活性和高产品选择性。

在PDH反应中，PtSnNa/SUZ-4由于外部表面有更多Pt，减少了由碳沉积引起的失活，因此优于PtSnNa/ZSM-5\[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]。ZSM-5的较弱酸性导致Sn氧化物更容易还原，降低了催化活性。SUZ-4的强酸位点阻止了Pt前体的渗透，而ZSM-5的弱位点允许更深的Pt分散，影响了活性。丙烯选择性、转化率和稳定性通过Pt分布、沸石酸性和Pt-Sn-载体相互作用得到增强。
