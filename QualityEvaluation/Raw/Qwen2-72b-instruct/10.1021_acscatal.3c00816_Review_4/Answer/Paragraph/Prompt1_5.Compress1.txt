{"DOC": "The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support stabilizes the catalyst's activity and performance. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits superior stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. Optimal conditions include a temperature of 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h-1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, enhancing dispersion and facilitating carbon deposit transfer from metal sites to the support. However, excessive Sn (over 1 wt %) negatively impacts performance. Sn decreases coke deposition by suppressing its formation, enhancing catalyst stability. The preparation of SAPO-34 involves a specific molar ratio of Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O. Bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation. XRD, XRF, BET, TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's structure, metallic content, surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation. IR spectroscopy studies the acidity of the catalysts. Sn up to 1 wt % improves catalytic performance, but beyond this, it diminishes the reaction rate. Sn content significantly affects catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity. The original structure of SAPO-34 is not altered by Pt and Sn incorporation. XRF confirms successful metal loading, and BET shows a decrease in surface area with increasing Sn loading due to pore blocking. Sn modifies the catalyst's geometry. NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal negligible effects of Sn on acidity, with small shifts toward lower temperatures indicating a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. Higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) blocks Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion. H2-TPR shows improved reduction properties of Pt with Sn, and higher Sn concentration leads to Sn0 species formation. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are inactive, but Pt attached to SnOx is active. Sn facilitates carbon deposit transfer when metals interact well with the support.

CoSiBeta catalysts, especially those with 0.5 wt% Co, exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity, with high propane conversion and selectivity, outperforming other Co catalysts and matching industrial standards. Co's earth abundance and catalytic activity for PDH make it a viable long-term option. CoOx species are primarily found at the T-sites of 0.5CoSiBeta. Catalysts with and without prereduction show similar performance, indicating that CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. Higher Co loadings increase initial propane conversion, with maximal conversions of 53, 59, 80, and 81% for 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta, respectively. Propylene selectivities are high and stable for 0.5/1CoSiBeta, reaching 98%.

Small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst maintains its activity over four cycles, indicating deactivation is due to carbon deposits, not cobalt sintering. Its TOF value for PDH at 550 C is 32.9 h-1, with a propylene selectivity above 97%, showcasing its superiority.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},
