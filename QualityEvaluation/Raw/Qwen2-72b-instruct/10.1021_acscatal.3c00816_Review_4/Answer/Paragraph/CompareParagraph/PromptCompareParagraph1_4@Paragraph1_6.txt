The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation boosts Pt dispersion and reduces Zn loss, enhancing propylene selectivity and conversion \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, nearing thermodynamic equilibrium \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Dealumination to create Si-Beta zeolites with abundant silanol nests improves metal dispersion and stabilization, boosting PDH performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts outperform Zn/Al-Beta in propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Co/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit higher propylene formation TOF \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity, improving propylene selectivity without affecting Lewis acidity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Direct PDH mechanism on -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically favorable \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Encapsulated Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions lead to high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent stability \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. PtSn/SAPO-34 shows higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\].

An improved post-synthesis strategy for PDH catalysts involves dealumination of H-beta and metal impregnation, leading to Sn incorporation into Si-beta's tetrahedral coordination states \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]. This promotes high dispersion of Pt nanoclusters due to strong Pt-Sn(IV) interaction \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]. Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show high propene formation rates and selectivity, with stable dehydrogenation and regeneration due to PtSn interactions and Sn confinement, maintaining catalytic activity over multiple cycles \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\].

Encapsulating subnanometric clusters in zeolite pores boosts stability and catalytic applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]. Framework-Sn in Beta zeolite anchors Pt precursors, forming Pt@Sn-Beta with enhanced stability in propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]. Zeolite pore restrictions and Sn's electronic effect inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, maintaining high propane conversion and propene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\].

In PDH reactions, CoOx species confined in SiBeta zeolite's T-sites (silanols) form ultrasmall Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, enhancing catalytic efficiency for PDH to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other Co catalysts and matching industrial standards \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. Co loading impacts catalytic performance, with initial propane conversion increasing and maximal conversion reaching around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. Propylene selectivities are high and stable for 0.5/1CoSiBeta, stabilizing at about 98% \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and ideal reusability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\].

In PDH reactions, PtSnNa/SUZ-4 outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to a higher external Pt quantity, minimizing deactivation by carbon deposition \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevent Pt precursor impregnation into the zeolite, while ZSM-5's weak acidity allows more precursor entry, leading to dispersed Pt clusters \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]. Sn oxides on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 are easier to reduce, decreasing catalytic activity \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\]. Key factors for improved performance include Pt distribution, zeolite acidity, and Pt-Sn-support interactions \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\].
