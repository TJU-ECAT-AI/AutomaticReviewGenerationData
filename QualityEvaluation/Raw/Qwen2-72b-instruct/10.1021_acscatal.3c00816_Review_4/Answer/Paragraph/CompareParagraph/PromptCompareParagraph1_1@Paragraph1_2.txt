The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology, as highlighted in studies \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\], \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, prepared by sequential impregnation, achieved 94% propylene selectivity and >97% total olefins selectivity, surpassing PtSn/ZSM-5 due to SAPO-34's larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\]. Dealuminated β zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters served as an efficient PDH catalyst, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with dealumination reducing strong acid sites and minimizing side reactions \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\]. Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn in the BEA framework, excelled in PDH, achieving high selectivity and stability, with the Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst achieving 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions, as detailed in the studies \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\], \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\], offer a fertile ground for future research. The optimization of preparation methods, such as sequential impregnation and dealumination, can lead to the development of catalysts with enhanced selectivity, conversion rates, and stability. The exploration of novel zeolite topologies, like SAPO-34 and Sn-Beta, with specific acidity and shape selectivity, presents opportunities for improving PDH efficiency. Future studies might focus on the synergistic effects of metal doping and zeolite topology, aiming to create catalysts that can operate under harsh conditions with minimal deactivation. Additionally, the investigation of the electronic effects of metal-support interactions, as seen in PtSn/SAPO-34 and Sn-Beta, could provide insights into the design of catalysts with tailored properties for PDH and other dehydrogenation reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology\[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl ratios >8.7 and 2.5 wt.% zinc showed the highest and most stable propane conversions, achieving thermodynamic equilibrium for propane dehydrogenation to propene (XPr 29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa) over 63 h time-on-stream (TOS) with >90% propene selectivity\[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Zinc loading through impregnation or ion exchange influenced activity and selectivity, with ion exchange inhibiting zinc loss\[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios (≤ 3.4) showed similar catalytic behavior regardless of zinc incorporation method\[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Preparation methods, composition, and topology significantly impact zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation boosts Pt dispersion and reduces Zn loss, enhancing propylene selectivity and conversion\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Dealumination to Si-Beta zeolites and Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts improve PDH performance\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts outperform Zn/Al-Beta in propane conversion and propylene selectivity\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Direct PDH mechanism on -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically favorable\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Encapsulated Pt species in Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions lead to high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and stability\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Encapsulated Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% activity after cycles, unlike conventional Pt/MCM-22\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites enhance PDH reaction rates\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\]. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance\[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_4\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have revealed the critical role of preparation methods, composition, and topology in enhancing catalytic performance. The optimization of these factors has led to significant improvements in propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques that further refine the distribution and interaction of active metal species within the zeolite framework, aiming to achieve even higher selectivity and stability. Additionally, the exploration of new zeolite topologies and compositions that can provide enhanced shape selectivity and acidity could open new avenues for PDH catalyst design. The integration of computational methods to predict and optimize catalyst properties based on theoretical calculations could also be a promising direction, allowing for the rational design of catalysts with tailored active sites for PDH reactions.
