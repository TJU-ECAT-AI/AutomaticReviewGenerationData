The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology. PtSn/SAPO-34, prepared by sequential impregnation, achieved 94% propylene selectivity and >97% total olefins selectivity, surpassing PtSn/ZSM-5 due to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity \[10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008\]. Dealuminated β zeolite with anchored ZnO nanoclusters serves as an efficient PDH catalyst, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1002/cctc.201801708\]. Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn in the BEA framework, excels in PDH reactions, showing high selectivity, activity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019\]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances PDH catalytic activity, improving propylene selectivity and conversion rates \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]. The location of Pt clusters on X-zeolite significantly impacts catalyst performance in PDH reactions \[10.1039/D1CY00738F\]. Zeolite-based catalysts' performance in PDH reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and topology \[10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028\]. Preparation methods, composition, and topology significantly impact zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_4\]. The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is influenced by interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support \[10.1021/ie901465s\]. An improved post-synthesis strategy for Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts in PDH reactions involves dealumination of H-beta and metal impregnation \[10.1039/C9CY01907C\]. In PDH reactions, VOx catalysts on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) exhibit catalytic activities proportional to the amount of acidic sites generated from VOx-SiBeta interaction \[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3\]. Encapsulating subnanometric clusters in zeolite pores boosts stability and catalytic applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022\]. In PDH reactions, CoOx species confined in T-sites of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite form ultrasmall Co particles under H2 or reactant gas, enhancing PDH efficiency \[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037\]. In PDH reactions, PtSnNa/SUZ-4 outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to a higher Pt quantity on external surfaces, minimizing deactivation by carbon deposition \[10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the critical role of preparation methods, composition, and topology in the performance of zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions. The future of PDH catalyst development may focus on exploring innovative synthesis techniques, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and encapsulation of subnanometric clusters, to precisely control the size and distribution of active species, thereby improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Additionally, the investigation of novel zeolite topologies and compositions, such as BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, could lead to the discovery of more efficient and stable PDH catalysts. The optimization of metal-support interactions, particularly the role of Pt, Sn, and Co in PDH reactions, may also contribute to the development of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative metal species and the investigation of their synergistic effects with zeolite supports could open new avenues for PDH catalyst design. Lastly, the development of post-synthesis strategies, such as dealumination and metal impregnation, could further enhance the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.
