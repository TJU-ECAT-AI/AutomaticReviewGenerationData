[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
[4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
[5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
[6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
[7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
[8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
[9] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[10] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
[11] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
[12] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
[13] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
[14] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
[15] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
[16] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
[17] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
[18] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
[19] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
[20] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
[21] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
[22] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
[23] "The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions are shown in Fig. 9 ."
[24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
[25] "The doublet separation between the two signals is about 15.7 eV and the weak satellite peaks located at 786.3 and 804.3 eV jointly confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4."
[26] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
[27] "The doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta."
[28] "The TEM images of Fig. S3 show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively."
[29] "The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta in Fig. S4 a evidences the presence of metallic Co."
[30] "The H2 TPR profiles of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts ( Fig. S4 b) show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx."
[31] "The initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta."
[32] "Therefore, the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
[33] "The large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta."
[34] "After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition."
[35] "The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst are at 782.0 and 797.6 eV ( Fig. S7 ), with the two spinorbital peaks appearing at 786.0 and 804.5 eV, confirming there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance."
[36] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
[37] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
[38] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
[39] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
[40] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
[41] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。在脱铝Beta(SiBeta)沸石中，CoOx物种在H2或反应气体的作用下发展成超小尺寸的Co颗粒，对催化PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，但诱导期不同，表明反应过程中原位形成的金属Co是活性位点。在600 C下，0.5 wt% Co负载的CoSiBeta催化剂表现出最先进的丙烯生产力，丙烷转化率约为72%，丙烯选择性超过92%，这远优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度和其报道的PDH催化活性使其成为PDH反应的有前途的催化剂。钴物种的分布和还原行为直接与支撑类型相关，而Beta沸石，由于其高比表面积、高稳定性和可调的内部环境，是支撑金属催化剂的理想基质。Beta沸石的脱铝处理创造了T-空位和低酸性，这对许多催化反应有益。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出相当大的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。钴物种主要以CoOx的形式存在于0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的T位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否在600 C下预还原处理1小时，其催化性能非常相似，尽管诱导期不同，表明被限制的CoOx可以在反应过程中还原为金属Co。初始丙烷转化率随着Co负载的增加而增加，从0.5CoSiBeta的40%增加到10CoSiBeta的86%。0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta催化剂的最大丙烷转化率分别约为53、59、80和81%。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性非常高且稳定，整个反应过程中稳定在约98%。3CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为92%，并在反应过程中持续增加。值得注意的是，10CoSiBeta的初始丙烯选择性为零，表明最初只发生副反应。之后，丙烯选择性迅速增加到约92%的高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。三种催化剂的初始丙烷转化率分别为Re10CoSiBeta的22%，Reox10CoSiBeta的60%，10CoSiBeta的85%。20分钟后，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率都达到约80%。所有初始丙烯选择性均为零，而值在10分钟内增加到Re10CoSiBeta的92%，Reox10CoSiBeta的70%，10CoSiBeta的仅20%。有趣的是，所有催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化活性(约80%)和丙烯选择性(约93%)，表明钴物种尽管初始状态不同，但转化为相同的活性相。6小时后，三种催化剂的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性分别保持在约40和98%的相同水平，呈现出相似的失活趋势。10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂的XPS光谱和TEM图像证实了金属Co和Co3O4颗粒的存在。金属Co的初始含量不同，顺序为10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5小时后表现出相似的催化性能，尽管钴的颗粒尺寸和初始化学状态不同，表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后拥有相同的活性位点。大Co3O4颗粒导致严重的副反应，这是10CoSiBeta初始丙烯选择性极低的原因。经过预还原处理后，所有表面Co3O4颗粒被还原为大Co0颗粒，最初显示出Re10CoSiBeta的丙烷转化率很小，这意味着大Co对于PDH几乎是不活跃的，只会导致碳沉积。对于3CoSiBeta催化剂观察到的Co2p3/2和Co2p1/2的结合能确认主要是Co(II)物种(在限制的CoOx中)，而非常少的表面Co(III)物种(在Co3O4中)会影响初始催化性能。PDH反应中CoSiBeta催化剂的循环稳定性是实际应用的先决条件，再生的0.5CoSiBeta的催化活性几乎与新鲜催化剂在四个循环中获得的相同，表明失活主要是由碳沉积而不是钴烧结引起的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的TOF值最高，在550 C的PDH反应中达到32.9 h1，远高于先前报道的值。同时，0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性也是最高的，值超过97%。因此，CoSiBeta催化剂的优越性显而易见。在不同WHSV下获得的TOF值表明，减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，并同时确认0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。因此，确定由限制的CoOx还原生成的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的巨大催化活性，以及理想的可重用性。
