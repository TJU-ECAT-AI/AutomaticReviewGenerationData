[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
[4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
[5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
[6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
[7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
[8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
[9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the silanols of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall Co particles under hydrogen or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for PDH. The easily reducible CoOx species confined in the T-sites of SiBeta support contribute to the high catalytic performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance, indicating that metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co loading exhibits state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The earth abundance of Co and its catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising catalyst. The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species are directly related to the support types, and Beta zeolite, with its high specific surface area and adjustable inner environment, is an ideal substrate for supporting metal catalysts. The dealumination of Beta zeolite further modifies its structural and acidic properties, creating T-vacant sites and low acidity that are beneficial for catalytic reactions. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are the active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对基于沸石的催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。在氢气或反应气体下，CoOx物种在脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石的硅醇中被限制，形成超小Co颗粒，对PDH具有高效率。容易还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta支撑的T位点中，对高催化性能有贡献。CoSiBeta催化剂无论是否经过预还原处理，都显示出相似的催化性能，表明在反应过程中原位形成的金属Co是活性位点。0.5 wt% Co负载的CoSiBeta催化剂表现出最先进的丙烯生产力，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。Co的地球丰度和其对PDH的催化活性使其成为有前景的催化剂。钴物种的分布和还原行为直接与支撑类型相关，而Beta沸石，由于其高比表面积和可调的内部环境，是支撑金属催化剂的理想基质。Beta沸石的脱铝进一步修改了其结构和酸性性质，创造了T空位和低酸性，这对催化反应有益。被限制在硅醇中的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，而大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒则导致裂解和碳沉积。
