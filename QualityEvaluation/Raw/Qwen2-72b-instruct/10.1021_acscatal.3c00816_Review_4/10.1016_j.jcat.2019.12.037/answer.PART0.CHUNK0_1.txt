[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
[4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
[5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
[6] "The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al."
[7] "Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination."
[8] "Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction."
[9] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, with its high dispersion of CoOx species confined in silanols, leads to the formation of ultrasmall Co particles under hydrogen or reactant gas, which are highly efficient for PDH. The CoSiBeta catalysts, with or without prereduction, show similar catalytic performance, indicating that metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites. The 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite demonstrates state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and selectivity, outperforming other Co catalysts and matching industrial catalysts. The earth's abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH, along with the proposed mechanisms involving Co(II) and single-site Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination, contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. The small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are confirmed as active sites, while bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, affecting catalyst stability.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。脱铝Beta (SiBeta)沸石中高度分散的CoOx物种被限制在硅醇中，导致在氢气或反应气体下形成超小Co颗粒，对PDH具有高效率。CoSiBeta催化剂，无论是否经过预还原，都显示出相似的催化性能，表明在反应过程中原位形成的金属Co是活性位点。0.5 wt% Co在SiBeta沸石中显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，具有高丙烷转化率和选择性，优于其他Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co在地球上的丰富度及其报道的PDH催化活性，以及涉及Co(II)和四面体配位下单位点Co2+的提出的机制，有助于提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。确认小金属Co颗粒限制在硅醇中是活性位点，而大块Co3O4和大Co0颗粒导致裂解和碳沉积，影响催化剂稳定性。
