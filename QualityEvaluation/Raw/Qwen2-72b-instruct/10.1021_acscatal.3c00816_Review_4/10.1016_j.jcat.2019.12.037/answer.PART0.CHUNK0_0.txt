[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."
[4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
[5] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
[6] "The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species."
[7] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts."
[8] "Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
[9] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[10] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
[11] "The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction."
[12] "The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta."
[13] "The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively."
[14] "Increasing Co loading from 3 to 10 wt% does not lead to a significant increase in propane conversion, meaning that there are the same numbers of active sites in the two samples."
[15] "The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction."
[16] "The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction."
[17] "Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first."
[18] "After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction."
[19] "The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta."
[20] "After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%."
[21] "The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min."
[22] "Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states."
[23] "After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends."
[24] "The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively."
[25] "After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction."
[26] "After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon."
[27] "Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst."
[28] "The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition."
[29] "Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites."
[30] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."
[31] "The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, much higher than those obtained in previous reports."
[32] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%."
[33] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
[34] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."
[35] "Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The confinement of CoOx species in the T-sites (silanols) of dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite leads to the formation of ultrasmall Co particles under reductive conditions, which are highly efficient for PDH to propylene. The CoSiBeta catalysts, with or without prereduction, exhibit similar catalytic performance, indicating that metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites. The CoSiBeta catalyst with 0.5 wt% Co loading shows state-of-the-art propylene productivity with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, outperforming other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The earth abundance of Co and its reported catalytic activity for PDH make it a promising candidate for PDH catalysts. The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species are influenced by the support types, with Beta zeolite being an ideal substrate due to its high specific surface area, stability, and adjustable inner environment. Dealumination of Beta zeolite creates T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, with a shortened induction period after reduction treatment. The cobalt species in the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst are mainly present as CoOx at the T-sites, which can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. Increasing Co loading leads to higher initial propane conversion, but the maximal propane conversion does not significantly increase beyond 3 wt% Co loading, indicating a similar number of active sites. The propylene selectivity is high and stable for the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts, while it increases continuously for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst. The 10CoSiBeta catalyst initially exhibits only side reactions, but the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value, suggesting PDH becomes the predominant reaction. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performance after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases regardless of initial states. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalyst show peaks at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, while the reductionoxidation treatment leads to the appearance of a peak at 780.2 eV, attributed to metallic Co. After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta are attenuated, possibly due to carbon deposition. A peak at around 779.0 eV, ascribed to confined metallic Co, is observed on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst. The 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts exhibit similar catalytic performance after 0.5 h on stream, suggesting they possess the same active sites after external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, while small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are the active sites. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows stable catalytic activity over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits rather than sintering of cobalt. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst has the highest TOF value for PDH at 550 C, with high propylene selectivity, confirming its superiority. Decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity, confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. The small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and ideal reusability.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。CoOx物种在脱铝Beta(SiBeta)沸石的T位点(硅醇)中被限制，在还原条件下形成超小Co颗粒，对PDH至丙烯反应具有高效率。无论是否进行预还原处理，CoSiBeta催化剂都表现出相似的催化性能，表明在反应过程中原位形成的金属Co是活性位点。0.5 wt% Co负载的CoSiBeta催化剂显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，优于其他报道的Co催化剂，与工业催化剂相当。Co的地球丰度和其报道的PDH催化活性使其成为PDH催化剂的有希望的候选者。钴物种的分布和还原行为受支撑类型的影响，Beta沸石是理想的基质，因为它具有高比表面积、稳定性和可调节的内部环境。Beta沸石的脱铝化创造了T空位和低酸性，这对催化反应有益。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂显示出高催化活性和丙烯选择性，还原处理后诱导期明显缩短。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂中的钴物种主要以T位点的CoOx形式存在，可以在反应过程中还原为金属Co。增加Co负载导致更高的初始丙烷转化率，但超过3 wt% Co负载时，最大丙烷转化率没有显著增加，表明活性位点数量相似。0.5/1CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性高且稳定，而3CoSiBeta催化剂的丙烯选择性持续增加。10CoSiBeta催化剂最初仅显示副反应，但丙烯选择性迅速增加到高值，表明PDH成为主要反应。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5 h后显示出相似的催化性能，表明钴物种无论初始状态如何都会转化为相同的活性相。10CoSiBeta催化剂的Co2p XPS光谱显示781.2和796.9 eV的峰，而还原氧化处理导致780.2 eV的峰出现，归因于金属Co。在流经10分钟后，10CoSiBeta的Co2p XPS信号明显减弱，可能是由于碳沉积。在10CoSiBeta催化剂上观察到约779.0 eV的峰，归因于被限制的金属Co。10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂在0.5 h后显示出相似的催化性能，表明它们在外部钴物种被焦炭沉积覆盖后具有相同的活性位点。大块Co和Co3O4颗粒导致焦化和副反应，而小金属Co颗粒被限制在SiBeta中是活性位点。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂在四个循环中显示出稳定的催化活性，表明失活主要是由于碳沉积而不是钴的烧结。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂在550 C时具有最高的PDH TOF值，丙烯选择性高，证实了其优越性。减少催化剂质量会导致催化活性的损失，同时确认0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的内在活性。由被限制的CoOx还原生成的小金属Co颗粒是活性位点，显示出高产品选择性的高催化活性和理想的可重用性。
