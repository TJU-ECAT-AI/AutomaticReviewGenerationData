1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites improves propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The topology of the zeolites, such as pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of reactants and the dispersion of ZnO species. The ALD process allows for precise control over the size and distribution of ZnO clusters, which impacts the catalytic activity and stability. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the presence of isolated Zn(OH)+ species, which are more effective for propane conversion, and the balance between dehydrogenation and subsequent reactions that require Brønsted acid sites. Catalyst stability is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO沉积到ZSM-5和Y沸石上,可以提高丙烯的选择性和转化率。沸石的拓扑结构,如孔径和结构,影响反应物的可及性和ZnO物种的分散。ALD过程允许对ZnO团簇的大小和分布进行精确控制,这影响催化活性和稳定性。提高性能的关键因素包括存在孤立的Zn(OH)+物种,这些物种对丙烷转化更有效,以及脱氢和后续反应之间的平衡,后者需要Brønsted酸位。催化剂稳定性受焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。
