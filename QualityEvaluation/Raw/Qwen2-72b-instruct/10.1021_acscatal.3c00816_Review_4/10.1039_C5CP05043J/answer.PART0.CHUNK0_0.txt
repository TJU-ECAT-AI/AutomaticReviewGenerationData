1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO species into ZSM-5 and Y zeolites enhances the catalytic activity for propane conversion. The topology of the zeolites, such as the pore size and structure, affects the accessibility of the precursors and the distribution of the active species. The composition, particularly the loading and form of ZnO, impacts the selectivity and conversion rates. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics than larger ZnO clusters. The stability of the catalysts is affected by factors such as coke formation, sintering, and evaporation of ZnO species.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。通过原子层沉积(ALD)将ZnO物种引入ZSM-5和Y沸石中,增强了丙烷转化的催化活性。沸石的拓扑结构,如孔径和结构,影响前体的可及性和活性物种的分布。组成,特别是ZnO的负载和形式,影响选择性和转化率。孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比更大的ZnO簇更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃。催化剂的稳定性受到诸如焦炭形成、烧结和ZnO物种蒸发等因素的影响。
