1.The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst exhibits better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for propylene production include a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. An increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, improving catalyst stability.

1.PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢至丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。生产丙烯的最优操作条件包括温度585 C，重量小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化率范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。Sn含量从1 wt %增加对催化剂性能有不利影响。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。
