1.The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has shown advantages in better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The optimum operating conditions for the catalyst include a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Sn also facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support, which improves the catalytic performance up to a certain limit. After that limit, the presence of Sn causes a decrease in the reaction rate.

1.PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯的更好的立体化学控制方面显示出优势。该催化剂的最优操作条件包括585 C的温度，5.6 h1或更低的重量小时空间速度，0.25的H2/C3H8摩尔比，以及14-25%的转化范围。Sn的负载量修改了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。在一定限度内，催化性能在Sn的存在下得到大幅改善。超过这个限度后，Sn的存在导致反应速率的降低。
