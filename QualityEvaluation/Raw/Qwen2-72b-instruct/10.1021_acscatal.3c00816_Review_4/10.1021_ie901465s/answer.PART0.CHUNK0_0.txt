1.The performance of PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the activity and performance of the catalyst. The novel PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst exhibits better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene. The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 are responsible for its activities, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation is proposed on the basis of propoxy species. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation to propylene are a temperature of 585 C, weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The catalytic performance is largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit, after which it causes a diminution in the reaction rate. The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles, helping Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support. Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support. The increase in Sn content from 1 wt % adversely affects catalyst performance. The presence of Sn helps in decreasing coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction, ultimately improving catalyst stability.

1.PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢至丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。SAPO-34的Brnsted酸位点对其活性负责，基于结构框架上的两种不同羟基（OH桥接到Al和Si）。丙烷脱氢的机制基于丙氧基物种。丙烷脱氢至丙烯的最优操作条件是温度585 C，重量小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。在一定限度内，Sn的存在大大提高了催化性能，之后导致反应速率的降低。Sn的负载量修改了表面Pt集合体，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性帮助Pt分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积从金属位点向载体的转移。Sn含量从1 wt %增加对催化剂性能有不利影响。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂稳定性。
