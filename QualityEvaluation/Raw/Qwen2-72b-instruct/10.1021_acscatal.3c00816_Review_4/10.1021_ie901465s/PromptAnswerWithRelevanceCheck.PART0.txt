[62] "At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %) both L and B acidity was higher, but it blocked Pt active sites; therefore, even at higher acidities the conversion is low."
[63] "The reduction peaks at higher temperatures (above 450 C) indicated that the Pt interacted well with the support in the presence of Sn."
[64] "The peak height and width increase with the increase in Sn loading, between 400 and 600 C, which may be due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34."

1.The preparation of the SAPO-34 support involves mixing Al2O3, P2O5, SiO2, TEA, and H2O in a specific molar ratio. The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined SAPO-34 with SnCl2·2H2O and H2PtCl6 solutions to achieve desired Sn and Pt loadings. The XRD patterns confirm the structure of the catalysts, while XRF measurements verify the metallic content. BET surface area measurements and TPD, TPR, and TPO analyses provide insights into the catalyst's surface properties, reduction behavior, and coke formation, respectively. IR spectroscopy is used to study the acidity of the catalysts.
2.The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts is largely influenced by the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support. Pt aggregation during propane dehydrogenation is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, but Sn helps to disperse Pt during catalyst preparation, improving catalytic performance. Sn modifies surface Pt ensembles, changing the interfacial character between metal and support, and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support. The optimum operating conditions for propane dehydrogenation are 585 C, WHSV of 5.6 h1, H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit (1 wt %) improves catalytic performance, but beyond that, it diminishes the reaction rate. The Sn content has a significant impact on catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity.
3.The XRD patterns show that the original structure/topology of the SAPO-34 zeolite support is not altered by the incorporation of Pt and Sn. The peaks for Pt and Sn are not observed due to their low concentration, but they are believed to be monodispersed initially. The peak height decreases with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to changes in surface character. XRF analysis confirms the successful loading of metals, and BET results indicate that metallic incorporation modifies the geometric effect of the catalyst. The surface area decreases with increasing Sn loading, from 419 to 396 m2/g, due to pore blocking by Sn and/or Pt. The content of Sn has a significant impact on the catalyst's geometry.
4.NH3-TPD and IR analysis reveal that the presence of Sn (0.8-1.2 wt %) has a negligible effect on the acidity of the catalyst. Small shifts in peaks toward lower temperatures indicate a slight decrease in acid intensity. The highest ammonia uptake is observed at Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34. A small decrease in peak intensities is noted after increasing Sn loading, which reduces the intensity of Bronsted acid sites, making the catalyst less active for propane cracking and improving stereochemistry control over the reaction toward higher propylene selectivity. At higher Sn concentration (1.2 wt %), both L and B acidity are higher, but they block Pt active sites, resulting in low conversion even at higher acidities.
5.H2-TPR results show that the presence of Sn improves the reduction properties of Pt, while higher Sn concentration (from 1 wt %) leads to the formation of Sn0 species. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate good interaction between Pt and the support in the presence of Sn. The peak height and width increase with increasing Sn loading, possibly due to joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34. The increased Sn loading shifts the higher temperature peaks toward lower reduction temperatures, indicating the formation of Sn0 species. Direct anchored Pt sites with SAPO-34 are not active for dehydrogenation, but Pt attached to SnOx is believed to be active for the reaction.
6.The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which is possible when the metals interact well with the support. Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reducing carbon-metal bonds/interaction, allowing intermediates to move easily to the support. The presence of Sn helps to decrease coke deposition by suppressing the coke formation reaction and ultimately improves catalyst stability.

1.SAPO-34载体的制备涉及将Al2O3、P2O5、SiO2、TEA和H2O以特定的摩尔比混合。通过顺序浸渍煅烧的SAPO-34与SnCl2·2H2O和H2PtCl6溶液来制备双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，以实现所需的Sn和Pt负载量。XRD图案证实了催化剂的结构，而XRF测量验证了金属含量。BET表面积测量和TPD、TPR和TPO分析提供了催化剂表面性质、还原行为和焦炭形成方面的见解。IR光谱用于研究催化剂的酸性。
2.PtSn基催化剂的脱氢性能在很大程度上受到Pt、Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。在丙烷脱氢过程中，Pt的聚集是催化剂失活的主要原因，但Sn有助于在催化剂制备过程中分散Pt，从而提高催化性能。Sn通过改变金属与载体之间的界面特性来修改表面Pt集合体，并促进金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移。丙烷脱氢的最优操作条件为585 C、WHSV为5.6 h1、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25和14-25%的转化范围。Sn的存在在一定限度内（1 wt %）提高了催化性能，但超过这个限度，它会降低反应速率。Sn含量对催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性有重大影响。
3.XRD图案显示，Pt和Sn的掺入并未改变SAPO-34沸石载体的原始结构/拓扑。由于Pt和Sn的浓度较低，无法观察到它们的峰，但它们最初被认为是单分散的。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高逐渐降低，这可能是由于表面特性的变化。XRF分析证实了金属的成功负载，而BET结果表明，金属掺入改变了催化剂的几何效应。随着Sn负载量的增加，表面积从419降低到396 m2/g，这是由于Sn和/或Pt堵塞了孔隙。Sn含量对催化剂的几何形状有重大影响。
4.NH3-TPD和IR分析表明，Sn（0.8-1.2 wt %）的存在对催化剂的酸性几乎没有影响。峰向较低温度的小幅偏移表明酸强度略有下降。在Pt(0.5 wt %)Sn(1 wt %)/SAPO-34中观察到最高的氨吸收量。在增加Sn负载量后，峰强度的小幅下降减少了Bronsted酸位的强度，使催化剂对丙烷裂解的活性降低，并提高了反应向更高丙烯选择性的立体化学控制。在较高Sn浓度（1.2 wt %）下，L和B酸性都较高，但它们阻塞了Pt活性位，即使在较高酸性下，转化率也较低。
5.H2-TPR结果表明，Sn的存在改善了Pt的还原性能，而较高Sn浓度（从1 wt %）导致Sn0物种的形成。在较高温度下的还原峰表明，在Sn存在下，Pt与载体之间有良好的相互作用。随着Sn负载量的增加，峰高和宽度增加，这可能是由于Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的联合还原和有价值的相互作用。增加的Sn负载量将较高温度峰向较低还原温度偏移，表明Sn0物种的形成。直接锚定在SAPO-34上的Pt位点对脱氢不活跃，但附着在SnOx上的Pt被认为对反应有活性。
6.Sn的存在促进了金属位点上碳沉积向载体的转移，这只有在金属与载体良好相互作用时才可能发生。Sn通过降低表面积和减少碳-金属键/相互作用来修改Pt集合体，使中间体容易移动到载体上。Sn的存在有助于通过抑制焦炭形成反应来减少焦炭沉积，最终提高催化剂的稳定性。

1.PtSn基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能在很大程度上受到Pt，Sn和载体之间相互作用的影响。载体在稳定催化剂的活性和性能方面起着至关重要的作用。新型的PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯方面具有更好的立体化学控制。催化剂的最优操作条件是温度585 C，小时空间速度5.6 h1或更低，H2/C3H8摩尔比0.25，转化范围14-25%。Sn的负载量改变了表面Pt的集合，通过改变金属和载体之间的界面特性，帮助Pt更好地分散。此外，Sn促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移。然而，Sn含量从1 wt%增加会不利地影响催化剂的性能。Sn的存在通过抑制焦炭形成反应，帮助减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。
