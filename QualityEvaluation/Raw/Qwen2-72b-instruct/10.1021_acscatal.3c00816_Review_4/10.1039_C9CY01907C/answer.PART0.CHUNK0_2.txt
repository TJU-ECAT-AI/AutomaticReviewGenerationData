[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The improved post-synthesis strategy of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation leads to the incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). This results in the high dispersion of Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for PDH, with a high propene formation rate and selectivity. The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and Pt cluster sintering, contributing to the good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during multiple cycles.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能有重大影响。改进的后合成策略，即H-beta的脱铝化和随后的金属浸渍，导致Sn物种被纳入脱铝化beta（Si-beta）的框架中。这导致Pt物种以超小纳米团簇的形式在Pt/Sn-Si-beta上高度分散，这是由于Pt和Si-beta框架中限制的Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的催化性能，具有高丙烯形成率和选择性。强烈的PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制效应抑制了焦炭的形成和Pt团簇的烧结，从而在多次循环中几乎保持不变的催化活性，实现了脱氢和再生的良好稳定性。
