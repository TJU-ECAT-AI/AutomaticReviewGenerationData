[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1.制备高稳定性的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及一种改进的后合成策略，包括H-beta沸石的脱铝化和随后的金属浸渍。Sn物种以四面体配位状态被纳入脱铝化β（Si-beta）的框架中。由于Pt和Sn(IV)位点在Si-beta框架中的强相互作用，Pt物种以超小纳米团簇的形式高度分散在Pt/Sn-Si-beta上。制备的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的催化性能，其中在550 C时，丙烯生成率为2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性>99%，在600 C时，更高的丙烯生成率为3.1 mol g1Pt h1。此外，强烈的PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta框架中的限制效应抑制了焦炭的形成和Pt团簇的烧结，从而在550 C下四个循环期间几乎不变的催化活性下实现了良好的脱氢稳定性和再生。
