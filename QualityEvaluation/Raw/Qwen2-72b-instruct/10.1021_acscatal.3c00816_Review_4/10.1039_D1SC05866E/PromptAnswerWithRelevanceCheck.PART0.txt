1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. However, it does discuss the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation. It is found that In2O3 is formed on the external surface of the zeolite crystal after the addition of In(NO3)3 to H-CHA by incipient wetness impregnation and calcination. Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA). The BASs in H-CHA facilitate the formation and stabilization of In+ cations in extra-framework positions, and prevent the deep reduction of In2O3 to In(0). At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.

1.The document does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that indium on silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with a range of In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios, have been investigated to understand the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is found that In2O3 is formed on the external surface of the zeolite crystal after the addition of In(NO3)3 to H-CHA by incipient wetness impregnation and calcination. Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA). The BASs in H-CHA facilitate the formation and stabilization of In+ cations in extra-framework positions, and prevent the deep reduction of In2O3 to In(0). In+ cations in the CHA zeolite can be oxidized with O2 to form indium oxide species and can be reduced again with H2 quantitatively. At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst.

1.文件没有具体说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。但是，它确实提到，不同In/Al比和Si/Al比的硅酸盐、氧化铝和沸石查巴齐特(CHA)上的铟已被研究，以了解载体对铟物种化和其相应影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)的影响。发现In(NO3)3通过初始湿性浸渍和煅烧添加到H-CHA后，在沸石晶体的外表面形成In2O3。在H2气体(550 C)还原后，铟取代了Brnsted酸位点(BASs)中的质子，形成了框架外In+物种(In-CHA)。H-CHA中的BASs促进了框架外位置In+阳离子的形成和稳定，并防止了In2O3的深度还原至In(0)。CHA沸石中的In+阳离子可以被O2氧化形成铟氧化物物种，并且可以再次定量地用H2还原。在可比较的转化率下，In-CHA的稳定性和C3H6选择性(85%)优于In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3，这与In-CHA催化剂中较低的C3H8脱氢活化能(94.3 kJ mol1)和较高的C3H8裂解活化能(206 kJ mol1)一致。CHA中较高的Si/Al比似乎有利于PDH，通过降低包含多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的分数。
