How do the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability?

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
[3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
[4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

1.The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst showed higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation. The enhanced performance of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 can be attributed to a larger amount of Pt on its external surfaces, which is less prone to deactivation by carbon deposition that can block zeolite pores. In contrast, the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst had reduced interactions between Sn oxides and the support due to the weaker acidity of ZSM-5, leading to the easier reduction of Sn oxides to the metallic state, which decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1.PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比PtSnNa/ZSM-5更高的活性和更好的稳定性。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂性能的增强可归因于其外表面有更多Pt，这减少了因碳沉积堵塞沸石孔隙而导致的Pt失活。相比之下，PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中Sn氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用因ZSM-5的弱酸性而减弱，导致Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能有重大影响。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，表现出更高的活性和更好的稳定性，这是由于其外部表面有更多Pt，这最小化了因碳沉积堵塞沸石孔隙而导致的失活。在PtSnNa/ZSM-5中，Sn氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用因ZSM-5沸石的弱酸性而减弱，导致分散的Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括Pt在多孔支撑物上的分布、沸石的酸性和Pt、Sn与支撑物之间的相互作用。

[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
[5] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

1.The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation due to the Pt particles being primarily dispersed on the external surface, which prevents deactivation by carbon deposition. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevent the Pt precursor from entering the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allow more precursor to enter and form highly dispersed Pt clusters. The dispersed Sn oxides on ZSM-5 are easier to reduce to the metallic state, decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1.PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中优于PtSnNa/ZSM-5，因为Pt粒子主要分散在外部表面，防止了碳沉积导致的失活。SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前体进入沸石，而ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多的前体进入并形成高度分散的Pt簇。ZSM-5上分散的Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。
