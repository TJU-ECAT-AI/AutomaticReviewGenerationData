[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."
[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
[5] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

1.The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst outperforms PtSnNa/ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation due to the Pt particles being primarily dispersed on the external surface, which prevents deactivation by carbon deposition. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevent the Pt precursor from entering the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allow more precursor to enter and form highly dispersed Pt clusters. The dispersed Sn oxides on ZSM-5 are easier to reduce to the metallic state, decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1.PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中优于PtSnNa/ZSM-5，因为Pt粒子主要分散在外部表面，防止了碳沉积导致的失活。SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前体进入沸石，而ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多的前体进入并形成高度分散的Pt簇。ZSM-5上分散的Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。
