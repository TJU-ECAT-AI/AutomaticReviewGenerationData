[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores."
[3] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
[4] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

1.The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst showed higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation. The enhanced performance of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 can be attributed to a larger amount of Pt on its external surfaces, which is less prone to deactivation by carbon deposition that can block zeolite pores. In contrast, the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst had reduced interactions between Sn oxides and the support due to the weaker acidity of ZSM-5, leading to the easier reduction of Sn oxides to the metallic state, which decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1.PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比PtSnNa/ZSM-5更高的活性和更好的稳定性。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂性能的增强可归因于其外表面有更多Pt，这减少了因碳沉积堵塞沸石孔隙而导致的Pt失活。相比之下，PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中Sn氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用因ZSM-5的弱酸性而减弱，导致Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。
