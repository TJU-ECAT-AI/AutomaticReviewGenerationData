1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 due to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition that blocks the zeolite pores. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support are lessened in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersed Sn oxides that are easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the distribution of Pt on the porous support, the acidity of the zeolite, and the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and support.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能有重大影响。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂与PtSnNa/ZSM-5相比，表现出更高的活性和更好的稳定性，这是由于PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂的外部表面有更多Pt，这最小化了因碳沉积堵塞沸石孔隙而导致的失活。在PtSnNa/ZSM-5中，由于ZSM-5沸石的酸性较弱，Sn氧化物与支撑物之间的相互作用减弱，导致分散的Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属状态，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括Pt在多孔支撑物上的分布、沸石的酸性和Pt、Sn与支撑物之间的相互作用。
