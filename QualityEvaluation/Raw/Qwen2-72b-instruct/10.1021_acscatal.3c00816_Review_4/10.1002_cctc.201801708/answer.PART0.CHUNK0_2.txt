[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
[2] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
[3] "The left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
[4] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."
[5] "The SN ZnO supported on dealuminated β exhibited high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for PDH."
[6] "The systematic characterizations and a comparison with raw Hβ support indicate the important role of SN ZnO located in the dealuminated β zeolite."
[7] "Also, the function of silanol groups in dispersing and forming SN ZnO was clarified."
[8] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[9] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[10] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[11] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH."
[12] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."
[13] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

[16] "The initial propane conversion of Znβ catalysts with different Zn loadings has perfect linear relationship to the corresponding NH3 desorption amounts (FigureS8), which is in consistence with the LAS density."
[17] "Noticeably, the LAS are derived from the bonded SN ZnO, it thereby can be concluded that the catalytic activity of Znβ is dependent on the content of bonded SN ZnO."
[18] "Excess Zn loading or using raw Hβ as support lead to weak catalytic performance ascribed to the formation of inactive bulk ZnO."
[19] "Additionally, the dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions."
[20] "So the Zn catalyst supported on DeAlβ zeolite, with a large number of catalytically active SN ZnO and free of strong acid sites, showing high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity in PDH."
