[1] "ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene"
[2] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."
[3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
[4] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[5] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
[6] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
[7] "When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites."

1.The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance, with high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, as well as high stability and satisfactory reusability. The dealuminated β zeolite, by eliminating lattice Al atoms, can greatly depress side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites, which contributes to high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination can accommodate and anchor metal species, and when the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.

1.报道了小ZnO纳米簇支持在脱铝β沸石上作为新型催化剂用于丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯(PDH)的制备。该催化剂表现出高催化性能，具有高初始丙烷转化率和优异的丙烯选择性，以及高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。脱铝β沸石通过消除晶格Al原子，可以大大抑制副反应，因为没有强酸位点，这有助于高催化活性和丙烯选择性。脱铝后β沸石中与硅醇基团相关的空T原子位点可以容纳和锚定金属物种，当负载量足够低时，金属杂原子甚至可以完全掺入空T原子位点形成单核活性位点。
