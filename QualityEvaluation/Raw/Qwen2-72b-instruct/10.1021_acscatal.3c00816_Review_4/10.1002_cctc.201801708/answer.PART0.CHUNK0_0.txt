[3] "dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
[4] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."
[5] "the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,"
[6] "the dealuminated β zeolite as support might obtain highly-dispersed and small-sized ZnO species."
[7] "the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

1.The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite as a novel catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been reported. The catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance due to the high dispersion of ZnO nanoclusters on the dealuminated β zeolite, which greatly depresses side reactions due to the absence of strong acid sites. The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework, and the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species. The dealuminated β zeolite as support might obtain highly-dispersed and small-sized ZnO species. The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability.

1.已报道了小ZnO纳米簇支持在脱铝β沸石上作为直接脱氢丙烷到丙烯(PDH)的新型催化剂的制备。由于ZnO纳米簇在脱铝β沸石上的高分散性，该催化剂表现出高催化性能，这大大抑制了由于缺乏强酸位点的副反应。BEA型β沸石的酸性可以通过从框架中消除铝原子来轻松调节，脱铝后β沸石中与硅醇基团相关的空T原子位点可以容纳和锚定金属物种。脱铝β沸石作为载体可能获得高度分散和小尺寸的ZnO物种。10wt% Zn负载在脱铝β沸石上的最佳催化剂在4000cm3gcat1h1的空间速度下，显示出约53%的初始丙烷转化率和约93%的优异丙烯选择性，同时具有高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。
