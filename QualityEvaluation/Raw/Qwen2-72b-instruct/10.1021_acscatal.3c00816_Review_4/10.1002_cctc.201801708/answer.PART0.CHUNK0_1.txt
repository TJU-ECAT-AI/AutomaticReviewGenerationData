1.The preparation of small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite has shown high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms, creating vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups that can accommodate and anchor metal species. When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can be entirely incorporated into these sites to form mononuclear active sites. The small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite exhibit high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH. The role of small ZnO nanoclusters located in the dealuminated β zeolite is significant, and the function of silanol groups in dispersing and forming these nanoclusters has been clarified. The optimal catalyst, with 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite, shows a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and superior propylene selectivity of about 93%, along with high stability and satisfactory reusability.

1.在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，制备了小ZnO纳米簇，支持在脱铝β沸石上，显示出高催化性能。BEA型β沸石的酸性可以通过去除晶格Al原子来调节，形成与硅醇基团相关的空T原子位点，可以容纳和锚定金属物种。当负载量足够低时，金属杂原子可以完全被整合到这些位点中，形成单核活性位点。小ZnO纳米簇支持在脱铝β沸石上，在PDH中表现出高催化活性、选择性和稳定性。位于脱铝β沸石中的小ZnO纳米簇的作用是显著的，硅醇基团在分散和形成这些纳米簇中的功能已经得到澄清。最佳催化剂，10wt%的Zn负载在脱铝β沸石上，显示出约53%的初始丙烷转化率和约93%的优异丙烯选择性，同时具有高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。
