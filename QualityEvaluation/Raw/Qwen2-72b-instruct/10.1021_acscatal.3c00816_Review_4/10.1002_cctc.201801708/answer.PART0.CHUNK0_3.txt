1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Dealuminated β zeolite, with its BEA topology, can accommodate small ZnO nanoclusters, leading to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. The removal of lattice Al atoms from the framework adjusts the acidity of the zeolite, making it an ideal support for highly dispersed and small-sized ZnO species. The optimal catalyst, with 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite, exhibits high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, along with high stability and satisfactory reusability. The traditional methods of producing propylene, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), are no longer sufficient due to the depletion of petroleum. Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is considered one of the most effective ways to produce propylene. The traditional catalysts for PDH, Pt and CrOx based catalysts, have their own drawbacks, such as high cost and toxicity. Novel catalyst systems, including Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon based catalysts, have been reported for catalyzing PDH, which are free of the shortcomings of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts. Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to their low price, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic performance in PDH. The dealumination of Hβ zeolite creates a good condition for forming and anchoring SN ZnO. The catalytic performance of Zn supported on raw Hβ and DeAlβ supports are evaluated in PDH, and the influence of Zn loading amounts on the catalytic activity is exhibited. The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts. The initial propane conversion of Znβ catalysts with different Zn loadings has a perfect linear relationship to the corresponding NH3 desorption amounts, which is in consistence with the LAS density. The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Therefore, the Zn catalyst supported on DeAlβ zeolite, with a large number of catalytically active SN ZnO and free of strong acid sites, shows high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity in PDH.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能有重大影响。脱铝β沸石，具有BEA拓扑结构，可以容纳小ZnO纳米簇，从而提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。从框架中去除晶格Al原子可以调节沸石的酸性，使其成为高度分散和小尺寸ZnO物种的理想载体。最优催化剂，10wt% Zn负载在脱铝β沸石上，表现出高初始丙烷转化率和优异的丙烯选择性，以及高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），由于石油的枯竭，已不再足够。直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯（PDH）被认为是生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。PDH的传统催化剂，Pt和CrOx基催化剂，有其自身的缺点，如高成本和毒性。已报道用于催化PDH的新型催化剂系统，包括Zn、Sn、Co、Ga和碳基催化剂，这些催化剂没有商业CrOx和Pt基催化剂的典型缺点。其中，Zn基材料由于其低廉的价格、环保性和在PDH中表现出的高催化性能，被发现是最有前景的催化剂之一。Hβ沸石的脱铝创造了形成和锚定SN ZnO的良好条件。在PDH中评估了Zn在原始Hβ和DeAlβ载体上的催化性能，展示了Zn负载量对催化活性的影响。最优催化剂Znβ-10与ZnHβ-10和其他Znβ催化剂相比，表现出高丙烷转化率和优异的丙烯选择性。不同Zn负载量的Znβ催化剂的初始丙烷转化率与相应的NH3脱附量有完美的线性关系，这与LAS密度一致。脱铝β沸石几乎不含强酸位点，有效减少了副反应。因此，负载在DeAlβ沸石上的Zn催化剂，具有大量催化活性SN ZnO，且不含强酸位点，在PDH中表现出高催化活性和优异的丙烯选择性。
