[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
[4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
[5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."

1.The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The larger surface area, shape selectivity and suitable acidity of SAPO-34 were the possible reasons for the improvement in performance.

1.使用SAPO-34作为支撑，增强了PtSn基催化剂，用于直接丙烷脱氢制丙烯。催化剂通过顺序浸渍法制备，并通过多种方法进行表征。金属在SAPO-34上的掺杂并未影响其酸强度和支撑结构拓扑。使用PtSn/SAPO-34，实现了94%的丙烯选择性和大于97%的总烯烃选择性。结果在相同条件下与PtSn/ZSM-5进行了比较。SAPO-34的较大表面积、形状选择性和适宜的酸性可能是性能提升的原因。
