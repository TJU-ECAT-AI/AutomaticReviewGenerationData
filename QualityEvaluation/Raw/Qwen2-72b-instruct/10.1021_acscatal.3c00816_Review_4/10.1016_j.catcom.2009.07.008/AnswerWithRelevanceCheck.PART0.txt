          [1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
          [2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
          [3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
          [4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
          [5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
          [6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

          The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods, including XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM, and O2-pulse coke analysis. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength or structural topology. Using PtSn/SAPO-34, propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved. The results were compared with those of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst under identical conditions. The improved performance of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst can be attributed to its larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity.

          基于SAPO-34的PtSn基催化剂通过顺序浸渍法制备，并通过XRF、BET、XRD、NH3-IR、NH3-TPD、H2-TPR、HR-TEM和O2-pulse焦炭分析等方法进行了表征。金属在SAPO-34上的掺杂并没有影响其酸强度和结构拓扑。PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂实现了94%的丙烯选择性和大于97%的总烯烃选择性。这些结果与在相同条件下PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂的结果进行了比较。PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂性能的提高可归因于其较大的表面积、形状选择性和适宜的酸性。
