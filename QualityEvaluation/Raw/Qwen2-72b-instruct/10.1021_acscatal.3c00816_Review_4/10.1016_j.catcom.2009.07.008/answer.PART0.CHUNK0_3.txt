[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."
[2] "The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."
[3] "NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively."
[4] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34."
[5] "The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions."
[6] "The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

1.The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by various methods. The doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology. Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and suitable acidity of SAPO-34.

1.基于PtSn的催化剂使用SAPO-34作为支撑，用于直接将丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯。催化剂通过顺序浸渍法制备，并通过各种方法进行表征。金属在SAPO-34上的掺杂并没有影响其酸强度和支撑结构的拓扑结构。使用PtSn/SAPO-34，丙烯选择性达到94%，总烯烃选择性超过97%。在相同条件下，将结果与PtSn/ZSM-5进行了比较。改进的可能原因包括更大的表面积、形状选择性和SAPO-34的适宜酸性。
