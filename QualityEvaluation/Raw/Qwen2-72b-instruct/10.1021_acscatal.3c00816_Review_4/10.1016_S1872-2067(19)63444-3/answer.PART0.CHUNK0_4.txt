1.The document does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VSiBeta catalyst, which is a VOx catalyst supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta), shows high catalytic activity in PDH reactions. The catalytic activity is determined by the amounts of acidic sites, which are related to the VOSi bridges and very stable, and achieves its maximum value as entirely monomeric VOx are existent on SiBeta support. The original valance state of V has a negligible impact on the catalytic performance. The aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading.

1.文档没有提供具体信息，说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种基于沸石的催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，它确实提到VSiBeta催化剂，这是一种支持在脱铝化Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂，在PDH反应中显示出高催化活性。催化活性由酸性位点的数量决定，这些酸性位点与VOSi桥相关，非常稳定，并且在SiBeta支撑上完全存在单体VOx时达到最大值。V的原始价态对催化性能的影响可以忽略不计。VOx物种的聚合程度对丙烯选择性和失活速率有影响，两者都随着V负载的增加而增加。
