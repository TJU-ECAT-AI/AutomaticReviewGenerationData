1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance. Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount.

1.文献没有具体说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。但是,它确实提到,在不同V负载下,支持在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂在PDH反应中显示出不同的催化活性。催化活性与生成的酸性位点的数量呈良好的线性关系,这些酸性位点来源于VOx物种与SiBeta支撑之间的相互作用位点。V的初始价态似乎不影响催化性能。此外,VOx物种的聚合程度决定了丙烯选择性和失活速率,随着V负载量的增加,两者都会增加。
