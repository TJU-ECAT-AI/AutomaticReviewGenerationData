1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that the VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings show different catalytic activities in the PDH reaction. The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support. The nature of VOx species supported on other different materials should be carefully studied to obtain a general rule of the active phase of VOx catalysts in PDH reaction.

1.文献没有提供具体信息说明制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。但是，它确实提到，具有不同V负载的VOx催化剂支持在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上，在PDH反应中显示出不同的催化活性。催化活性与生成的酸性位点的数量呈良好的线性关系，这些酸性位点来源于VOx物种与SiBeta支撑之间的相互作用位点。应该仔细研究VOx物种在其他不同材料上的性质，以获得VOx催化剂在PDH反应中活性相的一般规则。
