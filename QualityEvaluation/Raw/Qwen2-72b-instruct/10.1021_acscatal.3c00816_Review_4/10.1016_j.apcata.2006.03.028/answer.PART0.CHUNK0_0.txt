[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
[4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
[5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
[6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
[7] "Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite."
[8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
[9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
[10] "The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5."
[11] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
[12] "The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc."
[13] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."
[14] "The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments."
[15] "The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments."
[16] "The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples are reported in Fig. 4 ."
[17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
[18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
[19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
[20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
[21] "The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts based on zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed. ZnO, binuclear (ZnOZn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn(OZn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. The specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained when zinc is introduced by ion exchange. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption peak at 530 C on the sample 0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. The PtZn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. The PtZn-containing zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios greater than 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibited the highest propane conversions with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。基于不同骨架结构类型的PtZn催化剂被系统地研究。在nSi/nAl比率大于8.7和锌含量接近2.5 wt.%的Beta和mordenite沸石上获得了最高和最稳定的转化水平。在沸石0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta上，观察到至少63小时时间在线的丙烷脱氢至丙烯的热力学平衡的稳定转化。这种沸石的丙烯选择性大于90%。通过浸渍或水溶液中的锌盐离子交换对沸石进行锌负载的研究。研究了沸石结构、nSi/nAl比率、锌负载及其位置对丙烷催化转化的活性和选择性的影响。在离子交换沸石中存在不同电荷的锌物种已被反复讨论。ZnO、二核(ZnOZn)2+或多元(Zn(OZn)n+1)2+物种可能与孤立的Zn2+离子共存，共同解释沸石中锌的总量。当通过离子交换引入锌时，母体沸石的比表面积基本保持不变。铂还原峰向更高温度的移动表明它受到锌存在影响。样品0.5Pt4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5在530 C的氢消耗峰表明存在另一种与锌相关的较不贵重的物种。通过离子交换将锌引入Na-ZSM-5沸石抑制了实验期间锌的损失。PtZn沸石Na-Beta样品表现出最高的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性超过90%，至少持续63小时。氢解和芳构化速率相对较低。催化剂0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta在实验结束(63小时)时保持稳定性能，锌损失可忽略不计。nSi/nAl比率大于8.7和锌含量接近2.5 wt.%的PtZn沸石Beta和mordenite表现出最高的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性超过90%，至少持续63小时。
