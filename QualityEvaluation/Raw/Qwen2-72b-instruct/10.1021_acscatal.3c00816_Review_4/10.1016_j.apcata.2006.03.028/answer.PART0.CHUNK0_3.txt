1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts based on zeolites Beta and mordenite with intermediate nSi/nAl ratios (8.7 to 26) and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.% exhibit the highest and most stable conversion levels. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was greater than 90%. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios (less than 3.4). The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the zeolite topology, the nSi/nAl ratio, the zinc content, and the method of zinc incorporation.
