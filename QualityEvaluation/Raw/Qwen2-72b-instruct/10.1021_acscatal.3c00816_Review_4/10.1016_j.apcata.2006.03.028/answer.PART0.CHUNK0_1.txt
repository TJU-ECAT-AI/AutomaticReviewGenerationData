[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites Abstract Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[3] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."
[4] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
[5] "The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."
[6] "The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures."
[7] "The (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratio of the other large-pore zeolites is generally equal or close to 1."
[8] "The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min1, 555 C, 4 h)."
[9] "The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite."
[10] "The specific surface area is not notably affected either by a slight over-exchange or by the reduction in hydrogen (see data for 0.5Pt/1.3Zn,Na-ZSM-5)."
[11] "This indicates that, in these ion-exchanged samples, the zinc species ((ZnOZn)2+, (Zn(OZn)n)2+ or ZnO, cf. Section 3.1.1), are located inside the zeolite pores, where they cannot alloy with the impregnated platinum."
[12] "The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble)."
[13] "The hydrogen consumption ( ) for the reduction at 235 C is much higher than that expected for the Pt4+ to Pt0 reduction. Obviously, part of the zinc is also reduced at this temperature, and platinum has possibly alloyed with zinc."
[14] "The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4 ."
[15] "The deactivation over these catalysts with time-on-stream is negligible (XPr = 60.2%,= 10.1% after 12 h on-stream for zeolites 0.5Pt/0.8Zn-ZSM-11 and 0.5Pt/2.7Zn-ZSM-11, Table 4 )."
[16] "The Pt-free zeolite 2.6Zn-Beta is a more stable, but initially less active (XPr  15%) and generally less selective ( < 60%) catalyst than zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5."
[17] "The conversion (XPr  29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr  29%, T = 555 C, p = 0.1 MPa)."
[18] "The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream ( Fig. 4 )."
[19] "The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et  6%, SAr  2.5%)."
[20] "The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc."
[21] "A typical feature of these catalysts is the presence of a hydrogen consumption peak at 166 C in the TPR experiments ( Fig. 3 c), pointing at a strong influence of the zinc on the platinum with respect to zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-Beta ( Fig. 3 a)."
[22] "The coke loading after 12 h on-stream of the PtZn-containing Beta-zeolites is similar (ca. 1820 wt.%)."
[23] "The propene selectivity in a steady state reached after 2.8 h on-stream is generally higher than 81%."
[24] "The coke loadings of the Pt/Zn,Na-Y zeolites are comparably high as on the catalysts based on zeolite Beta which also possess a spacious, three-dimensional pore system ( Table 5 )."
[25] "The PtZn-impregnated sample 0.5Pt2.7Zn/Na-Y is even the best catalyst among all catalysts based on zeolite Na-Y ( Table 5 )."
[26] "The propene selectivities are comparable, or slightly higher than those of the corresponding catalysts prepared from zeolite Y."
[27] "The increased cracking rates are responsible for the lower selectivities at higher zinc contents, e.g.,= 88.4 and 81.3% for zeolite 0.5Pt/5.4Zn,K-L at 1 and 12 h on-stream, respectively."
[28] "Consequently, for the same zinc content, a different PtZn interaction may prevail in zeolites Na-Y and K-L with respect to zeolites Na-Beta and Na-mordenite."
[29] "The observed propane conversion levels over the PtZn-catalysts Na-Y and K-L are generally lower than 25%."
[30] "Nevertheless, these samples are excellent dehydrogenation catalysts with propene selectivities exceeding 81%."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. PtZn-containing catalysts were prepared from zeolites with different framework structures, including Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL), and Na-Y (FAU). The highest and most stable conversion levels were achieved on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl ratios around 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. The zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta exhibited a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with a propene selectivity over 90% for at least 63 hours. The loading of the zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts was systematically investigated. The effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl ratio, the zinc loading, and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were studied. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites was repeatedly discussed in the literature. The (2nZn+nNa)/nAl ratio of the other large-pore zeolites is generally equal or close to 1. The specific surface area of the zeolite can be significantly reduced upon reduction of the PtZn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen. The PtZn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite. The specific surface area is not notably affected by a slight over-exchange or by the reduction in hydrogen. This indicates that, in these ion-exchanged samples, the zinc species are located inside the zeolite pores, where they cannot alloy with the impregnated platinum. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates that it is affected by the presence of zinc. The hydrogen consumption for the reduction at 235 C is much higher than that expected for the Pt4+ to Pt0 reduction, suggesting that part of the zinc is also reduced at this temperature, and platinum has possibly alloyed with zinc. The deactivation over the PtZn-containing zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 with time-on-stream is negligible. The Pt-free zeolite 2.6Zn-Beta is a more stable catalyst than zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5. The conversion corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen. The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 hours time-on-stream. The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment with negligible loss of zinc. A typical feature of the catalysts is the presence of a hydrogen consumption peak at 166 C in the TPR experiments, pointing at a strong influence of the zinc on the platinum. The coke loading after 12 hours time-on-stream of the PtZn-containing Beta-zeolites is similar. The propene selectivity in a steady state reached after 2.8 hours time-on-stream is generally higher than 81%. The PtZn-impregnated sample 0.5Pt2.7Zn/Na-Y is the best catalyst among all catalysts based on zeolite Na-Y. The propene selectivities are comparable or slightly higher than those of the corresponding catalysts prepared from zeolite Y. The increased cracking rates are responsible for the lower selectivities at higher zinc contents. For the same zinc content, a different PtZn interaction may prevail in zeolites Na-Y and K-L with respect to zeolites Na-Beta and Na-mordenite. The observed propane conversion levels over the PtZn-catalysts Na-Y and K-L are generally lower than 25%. Nevertheless, these samples are excellent dehydrogenation catalysts with propene selectivities exceeding 81%. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl ratio, the zinc loading, and its location. The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites also plays a significant role.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。从具有不同骨架结构的沸石(包括Na-ZSM-5(MFI)、Na-ZSM-11(MEL)、Na-Beta(*BEA)、Na-mordenite(MOR)、K-L(LTL)和Na-Y(FAU))制备了PtZn含量的催化剂。在nSi/nAl比值约为8.7、锌含量接近2.5 wt.%的Beta和mordenite沸石上获得了最高和最稳定的转化水平。在沸石0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta上，丙烷脱氢到丙烯的热力学平衡转化率(29%，T=555 C，p=0.1 MPa)的稳定转化率接近，持续至少63小时，丙烯选择性超过90%。通过浸渍或锌盐水溶液的离子交换系统地研究了沸石的锌负载。研究了沸石结构、nSi/nAl比值、锌负载及其位置对丙烷催化转化活性和选择性的影响。在离子交换沸石中存在不同电荷的锌物种在文献中被反复讨论。其他大孔沸石的(2nZn+nNa)/nAl比值通常等于或接近1。在氢气中还原PtZn浸渍的ZSM-5沸石时，沸石的比表面积可显著降低。通过随后浸渍锌和铂获得的PtZn物种很可能沉积在沸石的外表面。比表面积不受轻微过交换或氢气还原的影响。这表明，在这些离子交换样品中，锌物种位于沸石孔内，不能与浸渍的铂合金化。铂还原峰向更高温度的偏移表明它受到锌存在影响。235 C还原的氢消耗远高于Pt4+到Pt0还原的预期值，表明部分锌也在这一温度下还原，铂可能与锌合金化。在PtZn含量的沸石Na-ZSM-5和Na-ZSM-11上，随着时间的推移，失活可以忽略不计。无铂沸石2.6Zn-Beta比沸石0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5更稳定的催化剂。转化率对应于丙烷转化为丙烯和氢的热力学平衡。丙烯选择性在12小时后超过90%。氢解和芳构化速率相对较低。催化剂0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta在实验结束时保持稳定性能，锌损失可忽略不计。TPR实验中166 C氢消耗峰的典型特征表明锌对铂有强烈影响。Beta沸石的PtZn含量在12小时后具有相似的焦炭负载。在2.8小时后达到稳态的丙烯选择性通常高于81%。PtZn浸渍样品0.5Pt2.7Zn/Na-Y是基于Na-Y沸石的所有催化剂中最好的。丙烯选择性与从Y沸石制备的相应催化剂相当或略高。较高的锌含量导致较低的选择性，这是由于裂化速率增加所致。对于相同的锌含量，在Na-Y和K-L沸石中可能存在与Na-Beta和Na-mordenite沸石不同的PtZn相互作用。在PtZn催化剂Na-Y和K-L上观察到的丙烷转化水平通常低于25%。然而，这些样品是优秀的脱氢催化剂，丙烯选择性超过81%。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括沸石结构、nSi/nAl比值、锌负载及其位置。离子交换沸石中存在不同电荷的锌物种也起着重要作用。
