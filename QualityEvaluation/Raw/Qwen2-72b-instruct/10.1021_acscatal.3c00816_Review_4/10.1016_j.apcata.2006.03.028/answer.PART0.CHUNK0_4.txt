1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl ratios around 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was over 90%. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl ratios.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。在具有约8.7的nSi/nAl比率和接近2.5 wt.%的锌含量的Beta和mordenite沸石上，获得了最高和最稳定的转化水平。在0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta沸石上，观察到至少63小时的稳定转化，接近丙烷脱氢至丙烯的热力学平衡。这种沸石上的丙烯选择性超过90%。不同的锌掺入方法对具有较低nSi/nAl比率的大孔沸石的催化行为没有显著影响。
