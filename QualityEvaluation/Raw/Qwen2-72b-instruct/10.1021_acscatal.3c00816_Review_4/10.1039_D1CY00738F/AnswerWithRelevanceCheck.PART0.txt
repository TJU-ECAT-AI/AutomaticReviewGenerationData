          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages. The d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，并用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。与Pt@NaX催化剂中Pt簇粘附在X-沸石内部相比，Pt/NaX催化剂中Pt簇位于X-沸石外部，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高。此外，在反应18小时后，Pt/NaX中检测到较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是Pt簇的电子状态、周围的沸石框架和沸石笼的扩散效应。被限制在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心受到周围沸石负框架的显著调节，降低到较低的值，而d带中心较低的Pt簇不利于丙烷的活化。围绕封闭Pt簇的沸石框架抑制了丙烯的解吸，降低了其选择性，增加了反应过程中的焦炭沉积。显著的钝化效应主要归因于封闭Pt簇周围的沸石框架，它降低了Pt簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷的活化，阻止了丙烯的解吸，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。
