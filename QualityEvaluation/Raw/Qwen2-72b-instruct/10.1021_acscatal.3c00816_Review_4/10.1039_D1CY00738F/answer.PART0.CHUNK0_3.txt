1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，并用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。Pt/NaX催化剂，Pt簇位于X-沸石的外部，与Pt@NaX催化剂相比，TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高，其中Pt簇粘在X-沸石的内部。此外，在Pt/NaX反应18小时后，检测到较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。显著的钝化效应主要归因于封闭Pt簇周围的沸石框架，它降低了Pt簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷的活化，阻止了丙烯的解吸，降低了丙烯选择性，增加了焦炭沉积。
