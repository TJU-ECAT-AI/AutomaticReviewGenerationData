1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts of Pt clusters separately located on the inner and exterior of X-zeolite were carefully prepared and used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance. The Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite. Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the electronic state of the Pt clusters, the surrounding zeolitic framework, and the diffusion effect of zeolite cages.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。精心制备了Pt簇分别位于X-沸石内外的催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。发现Pt簇在沸石上的不同位置导致其催化性能的巨大差异。与Pt@NaX催化剂(其中Pt簇粘在X-沸石内部)相比，Pt簇位于X-沸石外部的Pt/NaX催化剂的TOF提高了1100%，丙烯选择性大大提高。此外，在反应18小时后，Pt/NaX中的焦炭沉积较少，稳定性较高。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是Pt簇的电子状态、周围的沸石框架和沸石笼的扩散效应。
