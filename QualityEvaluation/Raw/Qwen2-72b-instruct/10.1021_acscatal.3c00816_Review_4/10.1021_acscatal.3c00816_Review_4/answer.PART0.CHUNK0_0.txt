[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
[6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
[7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
[8] "The above studies suggest that abundant vacant T-sites in Si-Beta zeolites contribute to the metal dispersion as reactive sites, which exhibits promising PDH performance."
[9] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
[10] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
[11] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
[12] "Further detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting data reveal each Pt atom coordinates with about 6 Zn atoms to form (-Si-O-Zn)46-Pt coordination, which effectively contributes to the Pt dispersion and stabilization toward near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability throughout the 160 h PDH test."
[13] "For the resulting Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages."
[14] "After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
[15] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
[16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
[17] "Accordingly, it was indicated the Ga+ sites can better stabilize the intermediates due to propane CH cleavage (Ga+  [HGa3+C3H7]+) and therefore leads to the 43 times reaction rate of Ga-CHA than In-CHA."
[18] "The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support."
[19] "The dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment indicates that Pt species mainly disperse on the external surface of SUZ-4 support, while more Pt species locate within the pores of ZSM-5 support."
[20] "Coke species in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
[21] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
[22] "The zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits."
[23] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
[24] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to form Si-Beta zeolites with abundant silanol nests improves metal dispersion and stabilization, leading to enhanced PDH performance. The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst outperforms the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation TOF compared to previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. The Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst shows excellent propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in the catalyst and the coordination of Pt with Zn atoms contribute to high propylene selectivity and stability. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst retains high activity after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are active centers for PDH, with Ga+ sites stabilizing intermediates better than In+. The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst has superior PDH stability due to the dispersion of Pt species on the external surface. Encapsulated Pt clusters in the Pt@NaX catalyst have lower propane consumption TOF compared to superficial Pt clusters. The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has higher propylene selectivity and better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5.
