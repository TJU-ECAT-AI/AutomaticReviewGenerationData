[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
[6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
[7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
[8] "The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism."
[9] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
[10] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
[11] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
[12] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
[13] "The Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
[14] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
[15] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
[16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
[17] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
[18] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
[19] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
[20] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Optimized PtZn-Beta catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Dealumination of Beta zeolites to create Si-Beta zeolites results in abundant silanol nests that improve metal dispersion and stabilization, enhancing PDH performance. Zn/Si-Beta catalysts exhibit superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Co/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propylene formation TOF than previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping of Sn-Beta catalysts weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. Direct PDH mechanism on closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect mechanism. Encapsulation of Pt species within Si-Beta channels due to strong PtSn interactions leads to highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species, resulting in high propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and excellent catalytic stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in catalysts with Zn-OH nests contribute to Pt dispersion and stabilization, achieving near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 retain about 90% of initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 exhibits over 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+ sites form GaHx species upon H2 reduction, leading to higher PDH reaction rates. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are deemed as PDH active centers. Pt distribution on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 supports results in different coke distributions, with superior stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4. Encapsulated Pt clusters in Pt@NaX catalysts exhibit lower propane consumption TOF than impregnated Pt/NaX catalysts. PtSn/SAPO-34 exhibits higher propylene selectivity and yield than PtSn/ZSM-5 due to better coke-resistance and inert Bronsted acid sites in side pores.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。通过Zn离子交换后Pt浸渍制备的催化剂具有更高的Pt分散度和更低的Zn损失，导致丙烯选择性和转化率提高。优化的PtZn-Beta催化剂实现了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，接近给定条件下的热力学平衡。通过调整酸处理条件(酸浓度、处理时间和温度)，Beta沸石可以不同程度地脱铝，产生任意SAR的脱铝Beta沸石，甚至纯硅Beta沸石(Si-Beta)。去除晶格Al原子导致大量硅醇巢穴的形成，这是由于T位点的空缺，作为改善金属物种分散和稳定性的有效锚点，从而增强PDH性能。Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂。Co/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烯形成TOF高于以前的Co催化剂。Na+掺杂Sn-Beta催化剂削弱了Bronsted酸性，而不影响Lewis酸性，提高了丙烯选择性。DFT计算表明，在封闭的-Sn-(OSi)4位点上，直接PDH机制在能量和动力学上比间接机制更有利。由于强PtSn相互作用，Pt物种在Si-Beta通道内被封装，导致高度分散和均匀的Pt物种，从而实现高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和优异的催化稳定性。具有Zn-OH巢穴的催化剂中的高度孤立的Pt原子有助于Pt分散和稳定，实现接近100%的丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。封装在Pt@MCM-22中的Pt物种在经过五次反应-再生循环后保留了约90%的初始活性，而传统的浸渍Pt/MCM-22样品的活性损失超过40%。Y沸石上的Zn沉积完全消除了Bronsted酸位点，大大增加了强Lewis酸位点的数量，而ZSM-5沸石上只有部分Bronsted酸位点被去除。孤立的Ga+位点在H2还原下形成GaHx物种，导致更高的PDH反应速率。孤立的Ga+/In+位点被认为是PDH活性中心。Pt在SUZ-4和ZSM-5支撑上的分布导致不同的焦炭分布，PtSnNa/SUZ-4的稳定性更优。封装在Pt@NaX催化剂中的Pt簇的丙烷消耗TOF低于浸渍Pt/NaX催化剂。PtSn/SAPO-34由于更好的焦炭抗性和侧孔中惰性的Bronsted酸位点，其丙烯选择性和产量高于PtSn/ZSM-5。
