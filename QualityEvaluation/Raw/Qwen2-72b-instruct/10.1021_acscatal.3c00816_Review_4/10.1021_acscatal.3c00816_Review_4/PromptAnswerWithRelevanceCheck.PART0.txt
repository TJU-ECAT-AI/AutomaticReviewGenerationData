[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[4] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."
[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
[6] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
[7] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
[8] "The above studies suggest that abundant vacant T-sites in Si-Beta zeolites contribute to the metal dispersion as reactive sites, which exhibits promising PDH performance."
[9] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
[10] "The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys."
[11] "The Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."
[12] "Further detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting data reveal each Pt atom coordinates with about 6 Zn atoms to form (-Si-O-Zn)46-Pt coordination, which effectively contributes to the Pt dispersion and stabilization toward near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability throughout the 160 h PDH test."
[13] "For the resulting Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages."
[14] "After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
[15] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
[16] "The isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center."
[17] "Accordingly, it was indicated the Ga+ sites can better stabilize the intermediates due to propane CH cleavage (Ga+  [HGa3+C3H7]+) and therefore leads to the 43 times reaction rate of Ga-CHA than In-CHA."
[18] "The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support."
[19] "The dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment indicates that Pt species mainly disperse on the external surface of SUZ-4 support, while more Pt species locate within the pores of ZSM-5 support."
[20] "Coke species in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability."
[21] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
[22] "The zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits."
[23] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."
[24] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation.

The Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits superior propylene formation TOF compared to previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping weakens Bronsted acidity without affecting Lewis acidity, improving propylene selectivity. The Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst shows excellent propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and stability. Highly isolated Pt atoms in the catalyst and the coordination of Pt with Zn atoms contribute to high propylene selectivity and stability. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst retains high activity after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. Isolated Ga+/In+ sites are active centers for PDH, with Ga+ sites stabilizing intermediates better than In+. The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst has superior PDH stability due to the dispersion of Pt species on the external surface. Encapsulated Pt clusters in the Pt@NaX catalyst have lower propane consumption TOF compared to superficial Pt clusters. The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst has higher propylene selectivity and better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5.

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90%. Dealuminated Beta zeolites (deAl-Beta) with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta) enhance metal dispersion and stabilization, resulting in superior PDH performance. The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, outperforming the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst. The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst shows a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, surpassing previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts, improving propylene selectivity without affecting propane conversion. The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, with excellent catalytic stability. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst retains about 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition. The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits superior PDH stability compared to the counterpart with ZSM-5 support. The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters has a lower propane consumption TOF than the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst. PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。通过Zn离子交换和随后的Pt浸渍制备的催化剂具有更高的Pt分散度和更低的Zn损失，导致丙烯选择性和转化率提高。优化的0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时的反应中实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。通过调整酸处理条件(酸浓度、处理时间和温度)，Beta沸石可以不同程度地脱铝(deAl)，产生任意SAR的deAl-Beta，甚至纯硅Beta沸石(Si-Beta)。Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率为55%，丙烯选择性为90%，优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂。优化的0.5Co/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烯形成TOF为32.9 h1，优于先前的Co催化剂。Na+掺杂处理削弱了Sn-Beta催化剂的Bronsted酸性，提高了丙烯选择性，而不影响丙烷转化率。优化的Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂的丙烷转化率为47%，丙烯选择性极高，达到99%，并且在500°C下250小时的PDH反应中具有优异的催化稳定性。Pt@MCM-22催化剂在550°C下经过五次反应-再生循环后，保留了约90%的初始活性，而传统的浸渍Pt/MCM-22样品的活性损失超过40%。Y沸石上的Zn沉积完全消除了Bronsted酸位点，大大增加了强Lewis酸位点的数量，而ZSM-5沸石上只有部分Bronsted酸位点被去除。孤立的Ga+位点在150500°C下H2还原时可以形成GaHx物种，而550°C的较高温度会导致GaHx分解。SUZ-4支持的PtSnNa催化剂的PDH稳定性优于ZSM-5支持的催化剂。水热合成的Pt@NaX催化剂具有封装的Pt簇，其丙烷消耗TOF低于浸渍Pt/NaX催化剂。PtSn/SAPO-34(CHA拓扑结构)在相同条件下比PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂(40%)具有更高的丙烯选择性(7095%)，导致丙烯产量翻倍。
