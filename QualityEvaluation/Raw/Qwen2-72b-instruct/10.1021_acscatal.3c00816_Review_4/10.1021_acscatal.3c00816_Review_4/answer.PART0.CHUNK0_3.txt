[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[3] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[4] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."
[5] "The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1)."
[6] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
[7] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C."
[8] "The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss."
[9] "The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition."
[10] "The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition."
[11] "The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support."
[12] "The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1)."
[13] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation have higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90%. Dealuminated Beta zeolites (deAl-Beta) with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta) enhance metal dispersion and stabilization, resulting in superior PDH performance. The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, outperforming the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst. The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst shows a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, surpassing previous Co catalysts. Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts, improving propylene selectivity without affecting propane conversion. The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, with excellent catalytic stability. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst retains about 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss. Zn deposition on Y zeolites eliminates Bronsted acid sites and increases strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites are removed. The isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition. The SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits superior PDH stability compared to the counterpart with ZSM-5 support. The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters has a lower propane consumption TOF than the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst. PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。通过Zn离子交换和随后的Pt浸渍制备的催化剂具有更高的Pt分散度和更低的Zn损失，导致丙烯选择性和转化率提高。优化的0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时的反应中实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。通过调整酸处理条件(酸浓度、处理时间和温度)，Beta沸石可以不同程度地脱铝(deAl)，产生任意SAR的deAl-Beta，甚至纯硅Beta沸石(Si-Beta)。Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率为55%，丙烯选择性为90%，优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂。优化的0.5Co/Si-Beta催化剂的丙烯形成TOF为32.9 h1，优于先前的Co催化剂。Na+掺杂处理削弱了Sn-Beta催化剂的Bronsted酸性，提高了丙烯选择性，而不影响丙烷转化率。优化的Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂的丙烷转化率为47%，丙烯选择性极高，达到99%，并且在500°C下250小时的PDH反应中具有优异的催化稳定性。Pt@MCM-22催化剂在550°C下经过五次反应-再生循环后，保留了约90%的初始活性，而传统的浸渍Pt/MCM-22样品的活性损失超过40%。Y沸石上的Zn沉积完全消除了Bronsted酸位点，大大增加了强Lewis酸位点的数量，而ZSM-5沸石上只有部分Bronsted酸位点被去除。孤立的Ga+位点在150500°C下H2还原时可以形成GaHx物种，而550°C的较高温度会导致GaHx分解。SUZ-4支持的PtSnNa催化剂的PDH稳定性优于ZSM-5支持的催化剂。水热合成的Pt@NaX催化剂具有封装的Pt簇，其丙烷消耗TOF低于浸渍Pt/NaX催化剂。PtSn/SAPO-34(CHA拓扑结构)在相同条件下比PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂(40%)具有更高的丙烯选择性(7095%)，导致丙烯产量翻倍。
