[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
[2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
[3] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
[4] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[6] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[7] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
[8] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology have a significant impact on the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be highly effective in catalytic biomass conversion. In previous studies, Sn-Beta zeolite was used in propane dehydrogenation but showed negligible activity, acting only as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent research has discovered that Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations indicate that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation than the indirect pathway, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones, depending on the hydroxylation extents.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。Sn-Beta沸石含有单点Sn原子，以同形替代的方式存在于BEA框架中，在催化生物质转化中表现出高效，适用于C-C键偶联、C-O键断裂、Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley还原、Diels-Alder环加成和葡萄糖-果糖异构化。在先前的研究中，Sn-Beta沸石被用于丙烷脱氢，但活性可忽略不计，仅作为Pt组分的支撑和促进剂。然而，最近的研究发现，Sn-Beta沸石能在高温下激活丙烷的C-H键，表现出高选择性、良好活性和优异稳定性。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单点Sn的Lewis酸位点。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的Lewis酸性，但B/L比最低，在丙烷脱氢中表现出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。Sn-Beta沸石在72小时内极端反应条件下极其稳定，无任何可检测的失活。理论计算表明，直接途径在动力学上比间接途径更可行，开放位点比封闭位点更反应性，这取决于羟基化程度。
