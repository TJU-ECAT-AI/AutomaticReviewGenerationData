[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
[2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
[3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."

1.The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been widely used in catalytic biomass conversion. The Sn-Beta zeolite was previously applied in propane dehydrogenation reactions. In this study, it was found that the Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, showing high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from single-site Sn in the zeolite framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest amount of Lewis acid and the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high stability for the production of propylene.
