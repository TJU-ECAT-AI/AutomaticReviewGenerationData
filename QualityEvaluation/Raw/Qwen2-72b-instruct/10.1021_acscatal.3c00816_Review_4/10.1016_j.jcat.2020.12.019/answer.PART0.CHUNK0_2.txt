[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
[2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
[3] "The Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component."
[4] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[6] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[7] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
[8] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1.The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been found to be effective in catalytic biomass conversion and now shows high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. The direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation, and open sites are more reactive than closed ones depending on the hydroxylation extents.

1.制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有重大影响。Sn-Beta沸石，其中单个Sn原子同形地替代在BEA框架中，已被发现对催化生物质转化有效，现在在丙烷脱氢中显示出高活性和选择性。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单个Sn位点的Lewis酸位点。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂，具有最高的Lewis酸但最低的B/L比，丙烷脱氢性能最佳，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。Sn-Beta沸石在72小时内极端反应条件下无任何可检测的失活，极其稳定。直接途径在动力学上比间接途径更可行于脱氢，且根据羟基化程度，开放位点比封闭位点更反应性。
