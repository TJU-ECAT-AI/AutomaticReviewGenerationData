[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
[2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
[3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[6] "These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene."

1.The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been widely used in catalytic biomass conversion. The Sn-Beta zeolite was previously applied in propane dehydrogenation reactions. In this study, it was found that the Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, showing high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from single-site Sn in the zeolite framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest amount of Lewis acid and the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high stability for the production of propylene.

1.含有单点Sn原子等形态替代BEA框架的Sn-Beta沸石在催化生物质转化中得到了广泛应用。Sn-Beta沸石在我们之前的报告中被应用于丙烷脱氢反应。有趣的是，在这项研究中，我们发现Sn-Beta沸石能够在高温下激活丙烷的C-H键，它在丙烷脱氢中表现出高选择性、良好活性和优异稳定性。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单点Sn的Lewis酸位点。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的Lewis酸量和最低的Brnsted/Lewis比，表现出最佳的PDH性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。这些高效的Sn-Beta沸石为开发新一代高稳定性丙烷脱氢催化剂以生产丙烯提供了新的可能性。
