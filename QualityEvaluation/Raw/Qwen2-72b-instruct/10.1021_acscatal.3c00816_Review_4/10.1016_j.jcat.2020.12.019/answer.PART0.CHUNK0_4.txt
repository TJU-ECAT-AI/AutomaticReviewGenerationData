[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization."
[2] "The Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report."
[3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[6] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
[7] "Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents."

1.The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework, has been widely used in catalytic biomass conversion reactions. The Sn-Beta zeolite has been previously applied in propane dehydrogenation reactions. In this study, it was discovered that the Sn-Beta zeolite can activate the C-H bond of propane at high temperatures, exhibiting high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from single-site Sn in the zeolite framework. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%. Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours. Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta zeolites show that the direct pathway is kinetically more feasible for dehydrogenation, and open sites are more reactive than closed sites depending on the hydroxylation extent.

1.含有单点Sn原子等形态替代BEA框架的Sn-Beta沸石在催化生物质转化反应中得到了广泛应用。Sn-Beta沸石在我们之前的报告中已被应用于丙烷脱氢反应。有趣的是，在这项研究中，我们发现Sn-Beta沸石能够在高温下激活丙烷的C-H键，并在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高选择性、良好活性和优异稳定性。理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在源自沸石框架中单点Sn的Lewis酸位点上。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂，具有最高的Lewis酸但最低的B/L比，为丙烷脱氢提供了最佳性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。最重要的是，Sn-Beta沸石在72小时内，在丙烷脱氢的恶劣反应条件下，没有检测到任何失活，表现出极高的稳定性。在封闭Sn-Beta沸石中的理论计算表明，直接途径在动力学上比间接途径更可行，开放位点的反应性似乎比封闭位点更高，这取决于羟基化程度。
