Using first principles to predict bimetallic catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction The facile decomposition of ammonia to produce hydrogen is critical to its use as a hydrogen storage medium in a hydrogen economy, and although ruthenium shows good activity for catalysing this process, its expense and scarcity are prohibitive to large-scale commercialization. The need to develop alternative catalysts has been addressed here, using microkinetic modelling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies. The NiPtPt(111) surface, with one monolayer of Ni atoms residing on a Pt(111) substrate, was predicted to be a catalytically active surface. This was verified using temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments. The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals.
Main The ammonia decomposition reaction has recently been subject to an increasing level of attention due to the possibility of ammonia being used as a hydrogen storage medium in a possible hydrogen economy. Ammonia can be liquefied easily at a pressure of 8 atm at 293 K, leading to high energy densities. It is readily available because of its use in fertilizers, and is a CO-free source of hydrogen. Experimental studies of single-metal catalysts have shown that Ru is the most active decomposition catalyst1,2,3, but it is expensive and limited in supply; hence there is a need to develop either less expensive alternatives or catalysts with higher activity.
Ammonia decomposition proceeds by means of dehydrogenation,followed by recombination of N and H to form N2 and H2, respectively. It has been shown that the heat of nitrogen chemisorption is a good descriptor for ammonia synthesis and decomposition4,5. The binding energy of the nitrogen atom to the surface must be strong enough for dehydrogenation of the NHx species to occur, but sufficiently weak that the nitrogen recombines to desorb from the surface to complete the catalytic cycle. This trade-off leads to a volcano-type relationship between nitrogen binding energy and ammonia decomposition activity. Although Ru has the optimal heat of chemisorption among single metals, it is possible that bimetallic catalysts with higher activities might exist. Encouragingly for the ammonia synthesis reaction, a bimetallic catalyst (CoMo) has been found that is more active than Ru. However, because the activity for the CoMo catalyst decreases significantly in the presence of ammonia, with concentrations as low as 5%, its use as a decomposition catalyst is restricted4,5.
The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals. A metal with a high nitrogen binding energy (Mo) and one with a low binding energy (Co) were chosen to give a surface with an intermediate binding energy. Although this specific alloy catalyst may be stable4, for many bimetallic alloys, one metal often segregates to the surface either to minimize the surface energy of the alloyed system or due to adsorbate-induced reconfiguration6,7,8,9,10,11. This results in surface properties that are vastly different from the alloyed surface, and makes predictions from the periodic table interpolation method invalid.
Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal12,13,14. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles. The admetal can be on the surface of the host metal, giving rise to the surface configuration, or below the surface layer, forming the subsurface configuration. These two configurations have been shown, both experimentally and through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to have properties that differ drastically from one another and from the parent metals; these bimetallic surfaces are also very different from the corresponding alloyed system, where the topmost surface layer is intermixed with the two parent metals. Typically, the monolayer bimetallic surfaces have binding energies that are greater or less than both of the parent metals, depending on the configuration, and are not a function of the parent metal binding energies12,13. Owing to this nonlinear behaviour, there is currently no method to rationally design these novel catalysts.
In this study, we present full microkinetic models for NH3 decomposition on various single-metal catalysts, including Co, Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh, Ir, Re and Mo. These models include adsorbateadsorbate interactions, which have been shown to have a significant effect on calculated surface coverages, the rate-determining step and catalytic activity15. The results, combined with DFT data, are used to predict suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) systems, based on nitrogen binding energies, for the ammonia decomposition reaction. These bimetallic surfaces are then tested experimentally for their activity towards ammonia decomposition using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to validate the model predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our approach represents the first time that full microkinetic models and DFT predictions, together with experimental verification, have been combined to identify novel catalyst formulations and surface structures.
Results Computational results DFT calculations were performed to obtain the interaction energies for nitrogen and hydrogen adsorbates on the surface. The binding energies were determined at coverages of 1/9 to 1 monolayer (ML), which were then plotted as a function of coverage. Although not completely linear, approximating the data with a linear function is adequate for trends and screening studies as performed here. The binding energies extrapolated to the zero coverage limit (QA(0)) and the interaction parameters (IP), the slope of the line, for each metal studied are listed in Table 1. Plots of the binding energies and the linear fits can be found in the Supplementary Information. The zero coverage binding energy and the interaction parameter were used to approximate the binding energy at any surface coverage within the microkinetic models through the following equation:where θA is the coverage of adsorbate A.
Table 1 Monometallic binding energies and interaction energies.
Full size table The interaction parameters for hydrogen are low, at approximately 1 kcal mol1 (ML hydrogen)1. This may be a result of the small size of the hydrogen atom, the low binding energy or a combination of both. Because the hydrogen interaction parameters are small, they have very little effect on the reaction mechanism and predicted ammonia conversions. The nitrogen interaction parameters, on the other hand, are much greater, ranging from 27.0 to 42.6 kcal mol1 (ML nitrogen)1 (depending on the metal), and have a significant effect on conversion.
For each metal, the microkinetic model was used to calculate the conversion at the reactor exit. The overall ammonia decomposition reaction was modelled with 12 elementary reaction steps, with no assumption of a rate-determining step. The elementary reaction steps are as follows:where * represents an adsorbed surface species. The coverage-dependent atomic binding energies were used to calculate the molecular heats of chemisorption (QNHx) and the activation barriers of the elementary reactions using the bond-order conservation method16, resulting in activation barriers that were coverage-dependent. Pre-exponentials for the elementary reaction steps were taken from a previous literature study in which the pre-exponentials were fit to Ru experimental data with constraints on the overall entropic consistency15.
Figure 1 shows the predicted conversion of ammonia versus the nitrogen heat of chemisorption (QN(0)) at a reactor temperature of 850 K. Among the single-metal catalysts studied, Ru was found to have the highest activity, consistent with experimental data1,2,3. The model results (circles) for the full microkinetic library are in good agreement with an extensive experimental study of 13 metals from Ganley and colleagues1 (triangles). Figure 1 reveals a volcano relationship, and shows that the heat of nitrogen chemisorption is a good descriptor to identify surfaces with desirable catalytic activity (other possible descriptors are listed in Supplementary Section 4). This conclusion is consistent with previous studies on ammonia synthesis and decomposition reactions4,5, although in the current study repulsive adsorbateadsorbate interactions were accounted for and no assumptions of the rate-determining step or surface coverages were made, as is frequently done in previous literature studies. Through the models, a maximum activity (peak of the volcano curve) is predicted to be at a nitrogen heat of chemisorption of 134 kcal mol1.
Figure 1: Ammonia decomposition volcano curve.
Ammonia conversion calculated from microkinetic modelling (circles, left axis) at 850 K for various transition-metal catalysts and experimental supported catalyst turnover frequencies (TOF) (triangles, right axis) from Ganley and colleagues1 at 850 K plotted against the nitrogen binding energies (QN(0)). The dotted line is calculated by assuming average interaction energies (see Table 1) and a correlation between nitrogen and hydrogen binding energies to aid in determining the volcano maximum. The nitrogen binding energy is found to be a good descriptor for this reaction. The peak of the volcano curve is at a nitrogen binding energy of 134 kcal mol1, and this value is used to identify bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic activity for the ammonia decomposition reaction.
Full size image To determine the kinetically significant reaction steps, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The pre-exponentials of each forward and reverse elementary reaction step pair (Ai) (that is, R1 and R2, R3 and R4, and so on) were perturbed simultaneously, thus ensuring thermodynamic consistency. The normalized sensitivity coefficient for each reaction pair (NSCi) was calculated using where X is the conversion at the end of the reactor. The largest (in absolute value) model responses among the reaction pairs indicate kinetically significant reaction steps17,18 (see Supplementary Information). A sensitivity analysis performed on each of the surfaces shows the rate-determining step to be the removal of the second hydrogen (from the NH2; reaction R5) for surfaces with a nitrogen binding energy less than 125 kcal mol1. For surfaces with higher nitrogen binding energies, the removal of the first and second hydrogens (R3 and R5) and nitrogen desorption (R9) are kinetically significant, as shown in Fig. 2. At the peak of the volcano curve (134 kcal mol1), the removal of the second hydrogen is the most significant elementary reaction step, although the removal of the first hydrogen and nitrogen desorption are both kinetically significant. Interestingly, the dominant surface coverage changes from the left to the right leg of the volcano curve (Supplementary Fig. S4). This analysis underscores the fact that the kinetically significant step and dominant coverage may be changing along a volcano curve, the maximum in the volcano curve may be a result of multiple physical mechanisms, and the importance of performing a full microkinetic analysis rather than assuming a priori a rate-determining step and a dominant surface species.
Figure 2: Normalized sensitivity coefficients of the kinetically significant elementary reaction steps for each monometallic metal.
Pre-exponentials of the forward and reverse reaction pairs were perturbed simultaneously at a temperature of 850 K and the response of conversion was monitored. The reaction pairs that have the highest normalized sensitivity coefficient are kinetically significant reaction steps. The sensitivity analysis shows that there are multiple kinetically significant reaction steps and their sensitivity changes across the volcano curve. Only reaction pairs that have a normalized sensitivity coefficient above 0.01 for any metal are shown.
Full size image Because the nitrogen binding energy is a good activity descriptor, a DFT search was performed to identify catalyst surfaces that have a similar binding energy to the optimal value of 134 kcal mol1. Pt-based monolayer bimetallic surfaces were the focus of this study. These surfaces have been shown to form the surface (MPtPt) and subsurface (PtMPt) configurations, both experimentally and through DFT calculations11,12,19,20. Binding energies were calculated at the 1/9 ML coverage, which is a good approximation to the binding energies extrapolated to zero coverage. Table 2 shows the calculated nitrogen binding energies for several surface and subsurface configurations. Also included are the metalnitrogen bond lengths on each surface. The binding energies for the subsurface configurations are lower than both the parent metals due to a broadening of the d band, whereas the binding energies for the surface configurations are stronger than both the parent metals, due to a contraction of the d band21. For the subsurface configurations, the PtN bond lengths were similar to Pt(111), with only a slight lengthening of the bond. PtNiPt was the only subsurface configuration in which there was a shortening of the bond compared to the Pt(111) surface. For the surface configurations, the nitrogen surface bonds show much more variation, which is probably a result of the differences in the metals to which the nitrogen is bound.
Table 2 Library of DFT binding energies and bond lengths of nitrogen atoms at a 1/9 ML coverage on various monolayer bimetallic surfaces.
Full size table The nitrogen binding energies vary from 71 to 207 kcal mol1 by adding a second metal to the surface or subsurface layer of the Pt host. Based on the theoretical predictions in Fig. 1, the activity of these bimetallic surfaces should also follow a volcano relationship. The NiPtPt(111) bimetallic surface has a nitrogen binding energy of 130.7 kcal mol1, slightly lower than that of Ru, and is a potentially active catalyst (see the maximum in Fig. 1). The subsurface configuration, PtNiPt(111), and the parent metals, Pt(111) and Ni(111), are expected to have lower activities because of the weaker nitrogen binding energies (Table 2). The Ni/Pt bimetallic system was chosen as a test system to be studied experimentally in the current paper to assess the model predictions. Table 2 also identifies the CoPtPt(111) and FePtPt(111) surfaces as additional promising systems. The activity of these additional surfaces will be evaluated in future studies.
TPD studies of ammonia decomposition We tested the DFT/microkinetic model predictions using the NiPt bimetallic systems. The NiPtPt surface, together with PtNiPt, Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film, were tested for their activity towards ammonia decomposition through TPD experiments. Depositing Ni at room temperature leads to the NiPtPt surface, whereas depositing at 600 K leads to the PtNiPt configuration22. Depositing at least 5 ML of Ni achieves a surface with chemical properties similar to a Ni(111) surface23.
Ammonia (3 L, equal to 1 × 108 torr for 300 s, where L indicates Langmuir) was dosed onto each of the four surfaces at 350 K. Figure 3 shows the desorption spectra of the decomposition product, nitrogen, for each of the surfaces. The m/z = 14 AMU was used to monitor N2 desorption (N atoms from N2 cracking) to eliminate the overlap between N2 and any background CO adsorbed to the surface (both seen at m/z = 28 AMU). Detection of the peak at 626 K confirms that the NiPtPt surface is active towards decomposition. The absence of any peaks on the other three surfaces shows that these surfaces are not active towards decomposition at these dosing conditions. The results for Pt(111) are consistent with previous results, which showed that Pt(111) does not decompose ammonia under 400 K (ref. 24). The inactivity of the Pt(111), thick Ni(111) film and the PtNiPt surfaces can be attributed to the low binding energy of nitrogen on these surfaces, confirming the predictions from the microkinetic models. TPD results following the desorption of hydrogen from the four surfaces as well as ammonia dosed at low temperatures are provided in the Supplementary Information.
Figure 3: Ammonia decomposition on different NiPt surfaces.
TPD results of nitrogen desorption from the decomposition of ammonia on Pt(111), PtNiPt, NiPtPt and a Ni(111) film. 3 L of ammonia was dosed at 350 K, then the temperature was ramped at a heating rate of 3 K s1 and the desorption of nitrogen was monitored using a mass spectrometer. The NiPtPt surface is the only one that shows activity towards ammonia decomposition under these conditions, as indicated by the peak at 626 K. This confirms model predictions of the NiPtPt surface being active towards ammonia decomposition based on an optimal nitrogen binding energy and the other three surfaces being inactive due to a nitrogen binding energy that is too low.
Full size image Because the NiPtPt surface showed decomposition activity, the surface was exposed to 3 L of ammonia at various temperatures from 150 to 425 K to determine the onset temperature for decomposition (Fig. 4). Nitrogen coverages on the NiPtPt surface were quantified by comparing the integrated nitrogen peak area to the area produced by a saturation coverage of CO (θCO = 0.68) on the Pt(111) surface after taking into consideration the different sensitivity factors for N2 and CO, as described previously for other reactions on Ni/Pt(111) (ref. 25).
Figure 4: TPD spectra of nitrogen desorption from a NiPtPt surface after dosing 3 L ammonia at the specified temperature.
The nitrogen coverages (θN) resulting from ammonia decomposition are indicated. The inset shows the nitrogen coverage as a function of the dosing temperature. The saturation coverage of nitrogen on this surface is 0.3 ML, as indicated by the coverage plateau from the inset. The onset temperature for the sharp increase in the N2 peak area demonstrates that the NiPtPt surface is active towards the decomposition of ammonia at temperatures as low as 325 K.
Full size image The nitrogen coverage achieved at each dosing temperature is compared in the inset of Fig. 4. The coverage stays constant at 0.07 ML up to 300 K. At 325 K, the coverage begins to increase and continues to increase up to 375 K, indicating decomposition occurring during dosing at a phenomenally low temperature of 325 K. Above a dosing temperature of 375 K, the coverage stays constant because the surface is saturated with nitrogen at a coverage of 0.3 ML. A longer exposure of 6 L at 400 K was also performed (not shown), resulting in identical desorption spectra, confirming that saturation coverage was achieved. The saturation value is consistent with the saturation coverage of 0.28 ML on the Ru(0001) surface26.
Interestingly, the nitrogen desorption peak is constant at 630 K over all nitrogen coverages. This is surprising, because nitrogen desorption is a second-order reaction, and a peak shift towards lower temperatures at higher coverages is expected. The absence of this shift indicates that surface reconstruction may be occurring. Reconstruction of a Ni(111) surface to pseudo-Ni(100) has been reported in the presence of strong binding adsorbates such as N, C and S (ref. 27). Because the surface layer in Fig. 4 is Ni, a similar transition is likely to be occurring.
In a study of ammonia decomposition on Ru(0001), an exposure of 3,500 L of ammonia was dosed at 500 K to achieve a nitrogen saturation coverage26. In comparison, a saturation coverage is achieved with 3 L at 375 K on the NiPtPt surface. The significantly lower dosing temperature and ammonia exposure clearly indicate that the overall dehydrogenation barrier, which was shown through sensitivity analysis to be a kinetically significant reaction step, is much lower for the bimetallic surface.
The other kinetically significant reaction step for ammonia decomposition was found to be the recombinative nitrogen desorption (Fig. 2). Nitrogen on Ru(0001) was shown to have a peak desorption temperature ranging from 770 K at low coverages to 680 K at a saturation coverage of 0.28 ML, using the same heating rate of 3 K s1 used in this study26. The lower desorption temperature on NiPtPt is comparable to the highly stepped Ru(109) and under-coordinated Ru(111) and Ru(100) surfaces, which have peak desorption temperatures at a saturation coverage of 600 K (at 2 K s1) (ref. 28), 610 K (ref. 29) and 620 K (ref. 30), respectively. Furthermore, the desorption peaks from NiPtPt are much narrower, with a temperature span of 560725 K, compared to 550900 K from the Ru(0001) surface. Our results indicate that not only is ammonia dehydrogenation on NiPtPt facile, but also nitrogen desorption is relatively fast.
To support the DFT predictions and TPD experiments, HREELS was used to investigate the decomposition of ammonia on the NiPtPt surface. The HREELS results and the vibrational assignment of possible reaction intermediates are provided in the Supplementary Information. The most important observation from the HREELS results is that, furthermore to adsorbed NH3, partially decomposed intermediates including NH2 and atomic nitrogen are produced on NiPtPt at 350 K, supporting the TPD detection of the N2 gas-phase product from the decomposition of ammonia on the NiPtPt surface.
Discussion Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models. The NiPtPt bimetallic surface was predicted to be very active for the ammonia decomposition reaction; this was confirmed by experimental measurements using TPD and HREELS. The TPD experiments indicate that a NiPtPt catalyst may be more active than Ru based on a lower nitrogen desorption temperature and a remarkably low dehydrogenation barrier, both of which were determined to be kinetically significant reaction steps. For this reaction to take place under steady-state conditions, both NHx decomposition and nitrogen desorption must occur. Our results show that NHx decomposition occurs at temperatures as low as 325 K and the onset for nitrogen desorption is at 560 K. Therefore, steady-state decomposition activity should be seen at temperatures below 600 K.
As the activity is highly dependent on the location of the Ni atoms, the stability of the surface is very important. Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate9. For oxygen, which has a similar Pauling electronegativity as nitrogen (3.44 for oxygen and 3.04 for nitrogen), the surface configuration was shown to be more stable than the subsurface configuration through DFT and was confirmed experimentally. Exposure to oxygen caused the subsurface Ni to reconstruct to the surface configuration (NiPtPt) under conditions of both low pressure (1 × 107 torr O2) and atmospheric pressure9,31,32. A similar stability was predicted for the NiPtPt surface with nitrogen adsorbates9, and this surface is expected to be stable under reaction conditions.
Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation20,33,34. This, combined with strong agreement of the microkinetic models with the supported monometallic catalysts of Ganley and colleagues,1 gives reason to expect that the activity of the supported bimetallic catalysts for the ammonia decomposition reaction will also follow the predicted trends of the microkinetic models on the single-crystal surfaces.
The ammonia decomposition reaction was used in the current study as a test system due to the relative simplicity of the molecule and the decomposition reaction pathways. This methodology for predicting active monolayer bimetallic surfaces should also be applicable to more complex chemistries, although care must be taken to choose bimetallic systems that are thermodynamically stable under reaction conditions.
Methods Theoretical predictions DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) version 4.6 (refs 35, 36). A plane-wave basis set was used with an energy cutoff of 396 eV, together with ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials37 and the PW-91 functional38. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst Pack k-point grid39 was used for all slab calculations. All calculations were performed on the close-packed surfaces: fcc(111) for Pd-, Pt-, Ir-, Ni-, Rh- and Pt-based monolayer bimetallic surfaces; hcp(0001) for Co, Ru and Re; and bcc(110) for Mo. Lattice constants that were previously optimized for the PW-91 functional were used40. For the Pt-based monolayer bimetallic surfaces, the Pt lattice constant of 4.01 Å was used. A 3 × 3 supercell of four layers and a vacuum region equivalent to seven metal layers were used to decouple consecutive slabs. All calculations were performed spin-polarized, with the bottom two layers frozen to represent the bulk structure and the top two metal layers allowed to relax. An electron smearing parameter of 0.2 eV was applied and the convergences were set to 1 × 104 for the self-consistent electronic minimization loop and to 1 × 103 for the ionic relaxation loop.
DFT was used to calculate the binding energies of atomic species (N and H) on the single-metal and bimetallic surfaces using where E(adsorbate) is the energy of the atom in vacuum, E(slab) is the energy of the bare slab without adsorbates, E(slab+X adsorbate) is the energy of the slab with the adsorbates bound to the surface, and X is the number of adsorbates within the supercell. Atomic nitrogen and hydrogen binding energies were calculated at varying coverages, specifically at 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/3 and 1 ML. The adsorbate configurations used are shown in the Supplementary Information.
For the microkinetic models, a fixed-bed reactor with a length of 0.5 cm and a diameter of 0.32 cm was modelled. A flow rate of 70 s.c.c.m. and a catalytic surface area of 12,000 cm2 cm3 were used.
Experimental methods A two-level stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber, with a typical base pressure of 4 × 1010torr, was used for the TPD experiments25. A heating rate of 3 K s1 was used for preparation methods and all TPD experiments. Anhydrous ammonia, of 99.99% purity, was used and the purity was checked in situ with the mass spectrometer before experiments each day. Ammonia was dosed in the background for all experiments. After dosing, the temperature was held constant for 10 min to allow the residual ammonia in the UHV background to be pumped away before ramping the temperature.
The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by cycles of Ne+ bombardment at 600 K. The crystal was then heated to 890 K in 3 Langmuir (1 L = 1 × 106 torr s) oxygen, of 99.998% purity, to burn off any remaining surface carbon. The crystal was then heated to 1,100 K and held at this temperature for 5 min to anneal the crystal surface. This procedure was repeated until surface cleanliness was verified by Auger electron spectroscopy.
The Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces were prepared for this study by depositing Ni through physical vapour deposition on the clean, freshly annealed Pt(111) surface. Three Ni-containing surfaces were created: the surface monolayer (NiPtPt), the subsurface monolayer (PtNiPt) and a thick Ni(111) film that mimics a Ni(111) surface when over 5 ML are deposited on the Pt(111) surface23. Using preparation procedures described previously22,25, the PtNiPt surface was created by depositing Ni at 600 K until a Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratio of 1.0 was achieved. For the NiPtPt surface, Ni was deposited for the same amount of time at 300 K, resulting in an Auger ratio of approximately 1.5. The thick Ni(111) film was created by depositing Ni until an Auger ratio above 3.0 was achieved.
