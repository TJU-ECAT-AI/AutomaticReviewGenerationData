[7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as the storage of hydrogen in a more energy-dense form. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under various conditions. Reactor studies, summarized in Table 5, investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for CH and NH bond dehydrogenation. UHV studies, listed in Table 3, offer detailed information on the surface chemistry and reactivity of catalysts under controlled conditions. The studies often employ techniques such as N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, and XPS to characterize the catalysts. Reaction conditions, including temperature and reactants, are varied to optimize the catalytic processes. For instance, the dehydrogenation of NH3 has been studied using microkinetic modeling and DFT calculations to identify optimal bimetallic catalysts, with a volcano relationship observed between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion. Experiments using TPD have confirmed the activity of surfaces like NiPtPt(111) for ammonia decomposition. Hydrazine monohydrate has been explored as a hydrogen-storage material due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity. The dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, is important for industrial processes and hydrogen storage, with bimetallic catalysts like PtAu and PtNi showing enhanced activity and selectivity. DFT calculations and UHV studies have revealed that the presence of metals like Sn on Pt surfaces can increase dehydrogenation selectivity and reduce deactivation rates by decreasing the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts can also improve selectivity and reduce deactivation rates in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Pretreatment of catalysts with H2 and O2 can further enhance catalytic activity. Other metals, including Bi, Re, Pd, In, and Fe, have been found to promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline is an attractive economic opportunity, with template synthesis methods like PAA improving the activity and lifetime of PtRe catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts like PtNi and PtPd have shown improved activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel dehydrogenation, while PtRh supported on ZrO2 has demonstrated superior performance for gasoline dehydrogenation.

选择性脱氢反应对于化学品生产、燃料合成和氢气储存至关重要。这些反应使我们能够生产有价值的化学品和燃料，同时以更能量密集的形式储存氢气。反应器研究和超高压(UHV)研究对理解脱氢过程的贡献巨大，它们提供了关于在不同条件下支持催化剂性能的深入见解。反应器研究，汇总在表5中，探讨了CH和NH键脱氢的合成方法、表征技术和脱氢温度。UHV研究，列在表3中，提供了催化剂表面化学和反应性在受控条件下的详细信息。这些研究通常采用N2吸附、TEM、XRD、TPR、TPO、H2化学吸附和XPS等技术来表征催化剂。通过改变反应条件，如温度和反应物，以优化催化过程。例如，通过微动力学建模和DFT计算研究了NH3的脱氢，观察到氮结合能与氨转化率之间的火山关系。使用TPD实验确认了如NiPtPt(111)表面等对于氨分解的活性。由于其高氢储存容量，水合肼已被探索作为氢储存材料。烃类，如烷烃的脱氢，对于工业过程和氢气储存很重要，而像PtAu和PtNi这样的双金属催化剂显示出增强的活性和选择性。DFT计算和UHV研究揭示，像Sn这样的金属存在于Pt表面可以增加脱氢选择性并降低失活率，通过减少不饱和烃的结合能。在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢中，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn也可以提高选择性并降低失活率。通过H2和O2预处理催化剂可以进一步增强催化活性。当与Pt合金化时，包括Bi、Re、Pd、In和Fe在内的其他金属被发现可以促进脱氢反应。将低辛烷值的石脑油改造成高辛烷值的汽油是一个有吸引力的经济机会，使用PAA等模板合成方法可以提高PtRe催化剂的活性和寿命。像PtNi和PtPd这样的双金属催化剂在柴油脱氢中显示出改善的活性和对硫中毒的抵抗力，而PtRh在ZrO2上的支撑则在汽油脱氢方面表现出优越的性能。
