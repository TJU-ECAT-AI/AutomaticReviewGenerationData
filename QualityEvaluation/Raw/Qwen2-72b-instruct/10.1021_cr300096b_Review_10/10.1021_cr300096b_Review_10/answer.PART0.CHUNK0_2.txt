[1] "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."
[2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures."
[3] "Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."
[4] "A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14."
[5] "Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111)."
[6] "The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6."
[7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."
[8] "Singh and Xu have recently explored unsupported PtNi nanocatalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce H2 and N2 in a liquid-phase batch reactor at room temperature."
[9] "The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline."
[10] "Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed."
[11] "The TPD results in Figure 15a, the production of benzene is enhanced after depositing 0.5 ML Au on Pt, which shows higher benzene yield than on either Pt or Au/Pt surfaces with higher Au coverages."
[12] "The corresponding AES measurements (Figure 15b) show significant carbon accumulation on unmodified Pt after the TPD experiments, confirming that the Pt bonds too strongly to cyclohexene and decomposes it to produce atomic carbon."
[13] "In comparison, no carbon accumulation is detected on the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface after the same experimental procedures."
[14] "The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst."
[15] "DFT calculations predict that subsurface PtNiPt(111) also binds to unsaturated hydrocarbons more weakly than unmodified Pt(111)."
[16] "This is confirmed in reactor studies that show PtNi/γ-Al2O3 is more active for dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene than either monometallic catalyst."
[17] "The effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation is also found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation over PtNi/AC."
[18] "Hydrogen production on the bimetallic catalysts is enhanced by 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt % Ni catalyst and by 60 times as compared to the 0.5 wt % Pt catalyst."
[19] "The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene."
[20] "Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[21] "Reactor studies also show that adding only a small amount of Sn to Pt catalysts improves the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate."
[22] "Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts supported on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3/γ-Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst."
[23] "Similar results are observed for isobutane dehydrogenation over PtSn/γ-Al2O3."
[24] "The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst."
[25] "Catalytic activity over PtSn improves by pretreating the catalysts with H2 and O2 prior to reaction because of increased metal dispersion on the support."
[26] "Other metals that promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt are Bi, (340) Re, (339) Pd, (342, 343)In, (333) and Fe. (286)"
[27] "Dwindling crude oil reserves and strict air pollution regulations have made reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline an attractive economic opportunity."
[28] "Liu et al. recently utilized a template synthesis procedure to formulate PtRe/γ-Al2O3 with high activity for naphtha dehydrogenation."
[29] "The synthesis method involved a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) template to control the morphology of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the support."
[30] "Reaction studies performed at 766 and 769 K showed that catalysts prepared with PAA exhibited a 1.42.4% higher yield and a longer projected lifetime over commercial PtRe catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation."
[31] "The bimetallic interactions were analyzed using EXAFS and both the Pt LIII and Re LIII edges were analyzed."
[32] "If the catalysts were dried in air at temperatures  773 K prior to reduction, bimetallic bonds were formed."
[33] "However, if the catalysts were dried at higher temperatures, the transport of Re was inhibited and there were fewer bimetallic interactions, leading to lower activity."
[34] "The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage."
[35] "Bimetallic PtNi and PtPd catalysts supported on alumina or ceria have been shown to be active for diesel dehydrogenation."
[36] "Both bimetallic catalysts not only improved the activity but also increased resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel reforming."
[37] "The enhanced stability of the bimetallic catalysts is due to strong metalmetal and metalsupport interactions that change the electronic properties of the metals."
[38] "These changes in electronic properties improve sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance."
[39] "PtRh supported on ZrO2 was superior to both monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate for gasoline dehydrogenation."
[40] "The addition of a small amount Rh to the Pt catalyst increased conversion from 30% to 70%."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage, due to their ability to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from molecules. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the catalytic activity and selectivity of supported catalysts. These studies typically involve the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts using various methods such as impregnation, sol-gel, and reductive deposition, and the characterization of these catalysts using techniques such as N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and FTIR. Reaction conditions are varied to determine the optimal dehydrogenation temperatures and to assess the stability and activity of the catalysts. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the dehydrogenation of NH3 has been studied using DFT calculations and UHV experiments, revealing that the activity of the catalyst is related to the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface. The dehydrogenation of CH bonds has also been investigated, showing that the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi can enhance the resistance to carbon accumulation and improve the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective catalysts and reaction conditions for specific dehydrogenation reactions.
