Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and provide a means for hydrogen storage, which is essential for a hydrogen economy. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions, such as dehydrogenation temperatures, to optimize catalytic processes. For instance, a volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion has been identified, which helps in predicting the optimal catalyst for ammonia decomposition. TPD experiments have been used to compare the activity of different surfaces for ammonia decomposition, revealing that certain bimetallic surfaces are more active than others. Hydrazine monohydrate has been explored as a hydrogen-storage material due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity. The dehydrogenation of alkanes is important for industrial processes, and dehydrogenation can also be used for hydrogen storage. High-temperature dehydration processes can lead to catalyst deactivation, but modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal can maintain the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst. The use of bimetallic catalysts has been found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, leading to a lower deactivation rate due to decreased binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Pretreating catalysts with H2 and O2 can improve catalytic activity by increasing metal dispersion. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline is an attractive economic opportunity due to dwindling crude oil reserves and strict air pollution regulations. The use of a PAA template in the synthesis of PtRe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve yield and projected lifetime. Bimetallic catalysts have been found to enhance stability and sulfur tolerance for diesel reforming due to changes in electronic properties.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They are pivotal for the production of various chemicals and fuels and are essential for hydrogen storage applications. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods of catalysts, their characterization techniques, and the dehydrogenation temperatures. UHV studies, in particular, offer detailed information about surface reactions and the interaction between catalysts and reactants at the molecular level. For instance, the volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion has been identified through UHV studies, which has led to the prediction of optimal catalysts for ammonia decomposition. Reactor studies, on the other hand, provide data on the performance of catalysts under practical conditions, such as the activity of bimetallic surfaces for ammonia decomposition and the dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce hydrogen and nitrogen. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material has been explored due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity and liquid state at room temperature. The dehydration of alkanes, which is a critical industrial process for the production of polymers, ethers, and gasoline, is another area where dehydrogenation reactions are significant. The modification of Pt catalysts with a second metal, such as Au, Ni, or Sn, has been shown to improve the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. This is evidenced by the enhanced hydrogen production on bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts. DFT calculations and experimental studies have also revealed that the presence of surface Sn on Pt(111) increases the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate of the catalyst. The optimization of catalytic processes in this field is informed by these studies, which help in the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline and the reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels for hydrogen storage are examples of how dehydrogenation reactions can address dwindling crude oil reserves and air pollution regulations. Bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi, PtPd, and PtRh, have been shown to be active for diesel and gasoline dehydrogenation, with improved activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage, due to their ability to selectively remove hydrogen atoms from molecules. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the catalytic activity and selectivity of supported catalysts. These studies typically involve the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts using various methods such as impregnation, sol-gel, and reductive deposition, and the characterization of these catalysts using techniques such as N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and FTIR. Reaction conditions are varied to determine the optimal dehydrogenation temperatures and to assess the stability and activity of the catalysts. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the dehydrogenation of NH3 has been studied using DFT calculations and UHV experiments, revealing that the activity of the catalyst is related to the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface. The dehydrogenation of CH bonds has also been investigated, showing that the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi can enhance the resistance to carbon accumulation and improve the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective catalysts and reaction conditions for specific dehydrogenation reactions.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as the storage of hydrogen in a more energy-dense form. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under various conditions. Reactor studies, summarized in Table 5, investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for CH and NH bond dehydrogenation. UHV studies, listed in Table 3, offer detailed information on the surface chemistry and reactivity of catalysts under controlled conditions. The studies often employ techniques such as N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, and XPS to characterize the catalysts. Reaction conditions, including temperature and reactants, are varied to optimize the catalytic processes. For instance, the dehydrogenation of NH3 has been studied using microkinetic modeling and DFT calculations to identify optimal bimetallic catalysts, with a volcano relationship observed between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion. Experiments using TPD have confirmed the activity of surfaces like NiPtPt(111) for ammonia decomposition. Hydrazine monohydrate has been explored as a hydrogen-storage material due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity. The dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, is important for industrial processes and hydrogen storage, with bimetallic catalysts like PtAu and PtNi showing enhanced activity and selectivity. DFT calculations and UHV studies have revealed that the presence of metals like Sn on Pt surfaces can increase dehydrogenation selectivity and reduce deactivation rates by decreasing the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts can also improve selectivity and reduce deactivation rates in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Pretreatment of catalysts with H2 and O2 can further enhance catalytic activity. Other metals, including Bi, Re, Pd, In, and Fe, have been found to promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline is an attractive economic opportunity, with template synthesis methods like PAA improving the activity and lifetime of PtRe catalysts. Bimetallic catalysts like PtNi and PtPd have shown improved activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel dehydrogenation, while PtRh supported on ZrO2 has demonstrated superior performance for gasoline dehydrogenation.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and offer a method for hydrogen storage with higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen gas. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. The characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and CO chemisorption. The reaction conditions are varied to understand the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant composition on the catalytic activity and selectivity. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dehydrogenation. The volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion, as well as the comparison of ammonia decomposition activity on different surfaces, highlight the importance of surface chemistry in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material and the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine over PtNi nanocatalysts demonstrate the potential of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications. The dehydration of alkanes for polymer, ether, and gasoline production, and the use of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage, emphasize the versatility of dehydrogenation reactions. The enhancement of dehydrogenation activity and selectivity through the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals, such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi, illustrates the role of bimetallic interactions in improving catalytic performance. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation, as observed in the enhanced hydrogen production on PtNi/AC, underscores the importance of alloying in dehydrogenation catalyst design. The DFT calculations and experimental studies of alkenes on Sn/Pt alloys demonstrate the selectivity enhancement through the presence of surface Sn. The decrease in deactivation rate due to the lower binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on bimetallic particles and the improvement of catalytic activity through pretreatment of PtSn catalysts with H2 and O2 highlight the strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The promotion of dehydrogenation reactions by other metals, such as Re, Pd, In, and Fe, when alloyed with Pt, and the utilization of template synthesis procedures for the formulation of high-activity catalysts, such as PtRe/γ-Al2O3 for naphtha dehydrogenation, showcase the innovation in catalyst design. The enhanced stability of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi and PtPd, for diesel dehydrogenation, and the improved sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts for fuel reforming applications. The superiority of PtRh supported on ZrO2 over monometallic catalysts for gasoline dehydrogenation, in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate, highlights the importance of support selection in dehydrogenation catalyst design.
