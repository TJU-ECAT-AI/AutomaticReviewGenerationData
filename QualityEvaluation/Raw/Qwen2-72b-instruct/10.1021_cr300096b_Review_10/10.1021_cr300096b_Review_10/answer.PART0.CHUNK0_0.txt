[1] "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."
[2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures."
[3] "Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."
[4] "A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14."
[5] "Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111)."
[6] "The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6."
[7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."
[8] "Singh and Xu have recently explored unsupported PtNi nanocatalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce H2 and N2 in a liquid-phase batch reactor at room temperature."
[9] "The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline."
[10] "Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed."
[11] "Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained."
[12] "The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst."
[13] "The effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation is also found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation over PtNi/AC."
[14] "The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst."
[15] "Catalytic activity over PtSn improves by pretreating the catalysts with H2 and O2 prior to reaction because of increased metal dispersion on the support."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and provide a means for hydrogen storage, which is essential for a hydrogen economy. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions, such as dehydrogenation temperatures, to optimize catalytic processes. For instance, a volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion has been identified, which helps in predicting the optimal catalyst for ammonia decomposition. TPD experiments have been used to compare the activity of different surfaces for ammonia decomposition, revealing that certain bimetallic surfaces are more active than others. Hydrazine monohydrate has been explored as a hydrogen-storage material due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity. The dehydrogenation of alkanes is important for industrial processes, and dehydrogenation can also be used for hydrogen storage. High-temperature dehydration processes can lead to catalyst deactivation, but modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal can maintain the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst. The use of bimetallic catalysts has been found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, leading to a lower deactivation rate due to decreased binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Pretreating catalysts with H2 and O2 can improve catalytic activity by increasing metal dispersion. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline is an attractive economic opportunity due to dwindling crude oil reserves and strict air pollution regulations. The use of a PAA template in the synthesis of PtRe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve yield and projected lifetime. Bimetallic catalysts have been found to enhance stability and sulfur tolerance for diesel reforming due to changes in electronic properties.
