[1] "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."
[2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures."
[3] "Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."
[4] "A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14."
[5] "Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111)."
[6] "The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6."
[7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."

[11] "The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst."

[15] "The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene."
[16] "Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[17] "The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They are pivotal for the production of various chemicals and fuels and are essential for hydrogen storage applications. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods of catalysts, their characterization techniques, and the dehydrogenation temperatures. UHV studies, in particular, offer detailed information about surface reactions and the interaction between catalysts and reactants at the molecular level. For instance, the volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion has been identified through UHV studies, which has led to the prediction of optimal catalysts for ammonia decomposition. Reactor studies, on the other hand, provide data on the performance of catalysts under practical conditions, such as the activity of bimetallic surfaces for ammonia decomposition and the dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce hydrogen and nitrogen. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material has been explored due to its high hydrogen-storage capacity and liquid state at room temperature. The dehydration of alkanes, which is a critical industrial process for the production of polymers, ethers, and gasoline, is another area where dehydrogenation reactions are significant. The modification of Pt catalysts with a second metal, such as Au, Ni, or Sn, has been shown to improve the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. This is evidenced by the enhanced hydrogen production on bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts. DFT calculations and experimental studies have also revealed that the presence of surface Sn on Pt(111) increases the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate of the catalyst. The optimization of catalytic processes in this field is informed by these studies, which help in the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline and the reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels for hydrogen storage are examples of how dehydrogenation reactions can address dwindling crude oil reserves and air pollution regulations. Bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi, PtPd, and PtRh, have been shown to be active for diesel and gasoline dehydrogenation, with improved activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning.
