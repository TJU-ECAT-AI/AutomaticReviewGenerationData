[1] "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."
[2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures."
[3] "Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."
[4] "A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14."
[5] "Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111)."
[6] "The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6."
[7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."

[11] "The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst."

[15] "The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene."
[16] "Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and offer a method for hydrogen storage with higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen gas. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. The characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and CO chemisorption. The reaction conditions are varied to understand the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant composition on the catalytic activity and selectivity. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dehydrogenation. The volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion, as well as the comparison of ammonia decomposition activity on different surfaces, highlight the importance of surface chemistry in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material and the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine over PtNi nanocatalysts demonstrate the potential of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications. The dehydration of alkanes for polymer, ether, and gasoline production, and the use of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage, emphasize the versatility of dehydrogenation reactions. The enhancement of dehydrogenation activity and selectivity through the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals, such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi, illustrates the role of bimetallic interactions in improving catalytic performance. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation, as observed in the enhanced hydrogen production on PtNi/AC, underscores the importance of alloying in dehydrogenation catalyst design. The DFT calculations and experimental studies of alkenes on Sn/Pt alloys demonstrate the selectivity enhancement through the presence of surface Sn. The decrease in deactivation rate due to the lower binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on bimetallic particles and the improvement of catalytic activity through pretreatment of PtSn catalysts with H2 and O2 highlight the strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The promotion of dehydrogenation reactions by other metals, such as Re, Pd, In, and Fe, when alloyed with Pt, and the utilization of template synthesis procedures for the formulation of high-activity catalysts, such as PtRe/γ-Al2O3 for naphtha dehydrogenation, showcase the innovation in catalyst design. The enhanced stability of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi and PtPd, for diesel dehydrogenation, and the improved sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts for fuel reforming applications. The superiority of PtRh supported on ZrO2 over monometallic catalysts for gasoline dehydrogenation, in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate, highlights the importance of support selection in dehydrogenation catalyst design.
