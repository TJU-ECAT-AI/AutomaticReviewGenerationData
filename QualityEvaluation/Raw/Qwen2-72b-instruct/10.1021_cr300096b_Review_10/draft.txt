1. The significance, applications, and research methodologies of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, with emphasis on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, as investigated through reactor and UHV studies.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, as they enable the creation of valuable chemicals and fuels and offer a method for hydrogen storage with higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen gas \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. Reactor studies and UHV studies significantly contribute to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and CO chemisorption \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The reaction conditions are varied to understand the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant composition on catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dehydrogenation \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion, as well as the comparison of ammonia decomposition activity on different surfaces, highlight the importance of surface chemistry in dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material and the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine over PtNi nanocatalysts demonstrate the potential of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The dehydration of alkanes for polymer, ether, and gasoline production, and the use of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage, emphasize the versatility of dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The enhancement of dehydrogenation activity and selectivity through the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals, such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi, illustrates the role of bimetallic interactions in improving catalytic performance \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation, as observed in the enhanced hydrogen production on PtNi/AC, underscores the importance of alloying in dehydrogenation catalyst design \[10.1007/s10562-005-8009-x\]. The DFT calculations and experimental studies of alkenes on Sn/Pt alloys demonstrate the selectivity enhancement through the presence of surface Sn \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The decrease in deactivation rate due to the lower binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on bimetallic particles and the improvement of catalytic activity through pretreatment of PtSn catalysts with H2 and O2 highlight the strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and activity \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The promotion of dehydrogenation reactions by other metals, such as Re, Pd, In, and Fe, when alloyed with Pt, and the utilization of template synthesis procedures for the formulation of high-activity catalysts, such as PtRe/γ-Al2O3 for naphtha dehydrogenation, showcase the innovation in catalyst design \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The enhanced stability of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi and PtPd, for diesel dehydrogenation, and the improved sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts for fuel reforming applications \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\]. The superiority of PtRh supported on ZrO2 over monometallic catalysts for gasoline dehydrogenation, in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate, highlights the importance of support selection in dehydrogenation catalyst design \[10.1021/cr300096b_10\].
