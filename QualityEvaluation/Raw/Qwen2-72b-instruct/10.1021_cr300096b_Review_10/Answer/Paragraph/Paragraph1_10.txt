Selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, offering a sustainable pathway for the conversion of hydrocarbons and ammonia into valuable products and energy carriers. These reactions, particularly focusing on the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts, have garnered significant attention due to their potential to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. In chemical production, selective dehydrogenation enables the targeted synthesis of olefins, aromatics, and other intermediates, which are crucial for the manufacturing of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and other materials. For fuel synthesis, particularly in the context of renewable energy, these reactions facilitate the production of hydrogen, a clean fuel, from biomass and other sustainable sources. In hydrogen storage, dehydrogenation reactions offer a means to store hydrogen in a compact form, such as in ammonia, which can be later released through rehydrogenation. Research methodologies in this field often involve the use of reactor studies to optimize reaction conditions and catalyst performance, while ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies provide insights into the surface chemistry and mechanisms at the molecular level. These methodologies are essential for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, which are critical for advancing the practical application of dehydrogenation reactions in various industries.
