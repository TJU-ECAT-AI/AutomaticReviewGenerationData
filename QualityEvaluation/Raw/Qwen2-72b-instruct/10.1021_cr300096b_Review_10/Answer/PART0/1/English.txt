The literature does not provide information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it discuss the contributions of reactor studies and UHV studies to our understanding of these processes. The focus is on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor conditions. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g-1cat min-1 for a Ni loading of 20% by weight. The addition of a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) to the Ni-based catalysts resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing hydrogen production by approximately 1.5 times compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst. The 20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibited approximately 60 times higher hydrogen production rates compared to the 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst. The selectivity towards dehydrogenation was observed to be enhanced by the addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and offer a method for hydrogen storage with higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen gas. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. The characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and CO chemisorption. The reaction conditions are varied to understand the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant composition on the catalytic activity and selectivity. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dehydrogenation. The volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion, as well as the comparison of ammonia decomposition activity on different surfaces, highlight the importance of surface chemistry in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material and the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine over PtNi nanocatalysts demonstrate the potential of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications. The dehydration of alkanes for polymer, ether, and gasoline production, and the use of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage, emphasize the versatility of dehydrogenation reactions. The enhancement of dehydrogenation activity and selectivity through the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals, such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi, illustrates the role of bimetallic interactions in improving catalytic performance.

The DFT calculations and experimental studies of alkenes on Sn/Pt alloys demonstrate the selectivity enhancement through the presence of surface Sn. The decrease in deactivation rate due to the lower binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on bimetallic particles and the improvement of catalytic activity through pretreatment of PtSn catalysts with H2 and O2 highlight the strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The promotion of dehydrogenation reactions by other metals, such as Re, Pd, In, and Fe, when alloyed with Pt, and the utilization of template synthesis procedures for the formulation of high-activity catalysts, such as PtRe/Î³-Al2O3 for naphtha dehydrogenation, showcase the innovation in catalyst design. The enhanced stability of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi and PtPd, for diesel dehydrogenation, and the improved sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts for fuel reforming applications. The superiority of PtRh supported on ZrO2 over monometallic catalysts for gasoline dehydrogenation, in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate, highlights the importance of support selection in dehydrogenation catalyst design.

The focus is on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor conditions. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g-1cat min-1 for a Ni loading of 20% by weight. The addition of a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) to the Ni-based catalysts resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing hydrogen production by approximately 1.5 times compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst. The 20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibited approximately 60 times higher hydrogen production rates compared to the 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst. The selectivity towards dehydrogenation was observed to be enhanced by the addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts. However, the literature does not provide details on the key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated in dehydrogenation studies, nor does it explain how these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the production of valuable chemicals and fuels and offer a method for hydrogen storage with higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen gas. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the performance of supported catalysts under reaction conditions. These studies typically investigate the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. The characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, XPS, AES, TPD, and CO chemisorption. The reaction conditions are varied to understand the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant composition on the catalytic activity and selectivity. UHV studies, in particular, allow for the examination of surface reactions at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of dehydrogenation. The volcano relationship between nitrogen-binding energy and ammonia conversion, as well as the comparison of ammonia decomposition activity on different surfaces, highlight the importance of surface chemistry in dehydrogenation reactions. The use of hydrazine monohydrate as a hydrogen-storage material and the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine over PtNi nanocatalysts demonstrate the potential of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications. The dehydration of alkanes for polymer, ether, and gasoline production, and the use of dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage, emphasize the versatility of dehydrogenation reactions. The enhancement of dehydrogenation activity and selectivity through the modification of Pt catalysts with other metals, such as Au, Ni, Sn, and Bi, illustrates the role of bimetallic interactions in improving catalytic performance. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation, as observed in the enhanced hydrogen production on PtNi/AC, underscores the importance of alloying in dehydrogenation catalyst design. The DFT calculations and experimental studies of alkenes on Sn/Pt alloys demonstrate the selectivity enhancement through the presence of surface Sn. The decrease in deactivation rate due to the lower binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on bimetallic particles and the improvement of catalytic activity through pretreatment of PtSn catalysts with H2 and O2 highlight the strategies for enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The promotion of dehydrogenation reactions by other metals, such as Re, Pd, In, and Fe, when alloyed with Pt, and the utilization of template synthesis procedures for the formulation of high-activity catalysts, such as PtRe/Î³-Al2O3 for naphtha dehydrogenation, showcase the innovation in catalyst design. The enhanced stability of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi and PtPd, for diesel dehydrogenation, and the improved sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance due to strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, demonstrate the potential of bimetallic catalysts for fuel reforming applications. The superiority of PtRh supported on ZrO2 over monometallic catalysts for gasoline dehydrogenation, in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate, highlights the importance of support selection in dehydrogenation catalyst design.

The study of dehydrogenation reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as Ni/Pt(111), is crucial for understanding the unique chemistry that occurs at monolayer Ni coverage. Techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy allow for the detailed characterization of adsorbate-surface interactions and reaction pathways. These studies provide insights into the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts, which are essential for the optimization of catalytic processes. The conditions under which these reactions are studied, such as temperature and pressure, are varied to understand the effects on reaction selectivity and activity. The results from these studies can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, which are important in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

The literature does not provide information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it discuss how reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts and their catalytic properties in various reactions, including the oxidation of CO, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral. The key research methods include high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies. The reaction conditions typically investigated include temperature, pressure, and reactant composition. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by providing insights into the structure-reactivity relationships and the role of electronic and geometric effects in bimetallic catalysts.
