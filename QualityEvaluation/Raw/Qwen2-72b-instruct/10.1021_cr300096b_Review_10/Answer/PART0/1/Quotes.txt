          [2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures."
          [3] "Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."
          [4] "A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14."
          [5] "Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111)."
          [6] "The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6."
          [7] "Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials."

          [11] "The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst."
          [12] "DFT calculations predict that subsurface PtNiPt(111) also binds to unsaturated hydrocarbons more weakly than unmodified Pt(111)."

          [15] "The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene."
          [16] "Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity."
          [17] "The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst."
          [18] "Catalytic activity over PtSn improves by pretreating the catalysts with H2 and O2 prior to reaction because of increased metal dispersion on the support."
          [19] "Other metals that promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt are Bi, (340) Re, (339) Pd, (342, 343)In, (333) and Fe. (286)"
