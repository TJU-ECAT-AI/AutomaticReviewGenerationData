          The study of dehydrogenation reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as Ni/Pt(111), is crucial for understanding the unique chemistry that occurs at monolayer Ni coverage. Techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy allow for the detailed characterization of adsorbate-surface interactions and reaction pathways. These studies provide insights into the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts, which are essential for the optimization of catalytic processes. The conditions under which these reactions are studied, such as temperature and pressure, are varied to understand the effects on reaction selectivity and activity. The results from these studies can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, which are important in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.
