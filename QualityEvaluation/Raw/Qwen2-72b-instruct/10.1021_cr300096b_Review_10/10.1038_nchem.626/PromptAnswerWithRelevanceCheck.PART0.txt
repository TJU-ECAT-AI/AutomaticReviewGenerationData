1.The literature does not provide information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it discuss how reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The document focuses on the use of microkinetic modeling combined with density functional studies to identify suitable monolayer bimetallic (surface or subsurface) catalysts based on nitrogen binding energies for the ammonia decomposition reaction.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it detail how reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes. However, it does discuss the ammonia decomposition reaction as a critical process for hydrogen storage in a hydrogen economy. The study uses microkinetic modeling combined with density functional theory to predict suitable bimetallic catalysts for ammonia decomposition. The research methods include DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, and experimental verification through temperature-programmed desorption and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The reaction conditions are typically high temperatures, and the study focuses on the binding energies of nitrogen and hydrogen to the catalyst surface. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying surfaces with desirable catalytic activity based on nitrogen binding energies.
