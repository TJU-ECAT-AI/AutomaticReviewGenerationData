1.The literature does not provide information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it discuss the contributions of reactor studies and UHV studies to our understanding of these processes. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor conditions. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g-1cat min-1 for a Ni loading of 20% by weight. The addition of a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) to the Ni-based catalysts resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing hydrogen production by approximately 1.5 times compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst. The 20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibited approximately 60 times higher hydrogen production rates compared to the 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst. The selectivity towards dehydrogenation was observed to be enhanced by the addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的重要性信息，也没有讨论反应器研究和UHV研究对这些过程理解的贡献。文献重点研究了在喷雾脉冲模式反应器条件下，Ni负载在活性炭布(ACC)催化剂上对环己烷脱氢至苯的影响。使用单金属Ni/ACC催化剂时，氢气最大生成速率在Ni负载量为20%（重量比）时为8.5 mmol g-1cat min-1。在Ni基催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.5 wt%）产生了协同效应，与仅含20 wt% Ni的催化剂相比，氢气产量提高了约1.5倍。与0.5 wt%单金属Pt催化剂相比，20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt双金属催化剂的氢气生成速率提高了约60倍。观察到在Ni/ACC催化剂中添加Pt增强了脱氢的选择性。
