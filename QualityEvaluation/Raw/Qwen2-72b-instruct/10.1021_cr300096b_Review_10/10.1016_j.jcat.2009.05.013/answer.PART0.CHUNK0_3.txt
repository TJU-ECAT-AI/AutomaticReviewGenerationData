1.The literature does not provide information on the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, nor does it discuss how reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts and their catalytic properties for various reactions, including the oxidation of CO, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral. The key research methods used include high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The reaction conditions investigated include temperatures ranging from 25 to 300 degrees Celsius and pressures ranging from atmospheric to 7 MPa. The results indicate that the catalytic behavior of Pt is significantly affected by the presence of Fe, and the enhancement of the catalytic activity observed for the oxidation of CO in air correlates with the fraction and degree of electronic PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption on Pt. The presence of Fe in small concentrations promotes the activity of Pt for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and the selective hydrogenation of citral, which can be attributed to either an electronic effect and/or the presence of bimetallic PtFe sites. The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can thus become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, it is possible that PtFe adsorption sites favor the di-σCO mode of adsorption for α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, thus promoting the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond and the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols.

1.文献没有提供关于选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的重要性的信息，也没有讨论反应器研究和UHV研究如何有助于我们理解这些过程，特别是关注在支撑催化剂上C-H和N-H键的脱氢。文献主要关注SiO2支撑的PtFe催化剂的制备和表征，以及它们在各种反应中的催化性能，包括CO的氧化、环己烷的脱氢和香叶醇的有选择性氢化。主要研究方法包括高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）、傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱。研究的反应条件包括从25到300摄氏度的温度和从大气压到7 MPa的压力。结果表明，Pt的催化行为受到Fe的存在显著影响，观察到的CO在空气中的氧化催化活性的增强与PtFe电子相互作用的分数和程度以及CO在Pt上的吸附强度相关。Fe在小浓度下的存在促进了Pt对环己烷脱氢和香叶醇有选择性氢化的活性，这可以归因于电子效应和/或存在二元PtFe位点。在这些位点中Pt和Fe的紧密邻近导致Fe的还原，从而使Fe能够对环己烷脱氢产生活性。此外，PtFe吸附位点可能有利于α,β-不饱和醛的di-σCO吸附模式，从而促进CO键的有选择性氢化和α,β-不饱和醇的形成。
