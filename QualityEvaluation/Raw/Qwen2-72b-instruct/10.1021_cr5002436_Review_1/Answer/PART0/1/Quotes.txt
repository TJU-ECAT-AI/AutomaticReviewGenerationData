[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
          [2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
          [3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
          [4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
          [5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
          [6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."







[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
          [2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
          [3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
          [4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
          [5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
          [6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
          [7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
          [8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
          [9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          [10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
          [12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
          [13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
          [14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
          [15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
          [17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."
          [18] "The latter have evolved primarily out of investigations of methane oxidative coupling."
          [19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
          [20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
          [21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
          [22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
          [23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
          [24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
          [25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
          [26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
          [27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
          [28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
          [29] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
          [30] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water."
          [31] "At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%."
          [32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
          [33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
          [34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
          [35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
          [36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
          [37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
          [38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
          [39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."
          [40] "Although the catalyst did show some deactivation with time, it can still maintain an ethylene yield as high as 50% after 24 h."
          [41] "Lin et al. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and Chonnam National University, Korea, found that a SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane."
          [42] "Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity, but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence."
          [43] "Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity."
          [44] "At 34% conversion of ethane, they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene."
          [45] "Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2."
          [46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
          [47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
          [48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."
          [49] "Longer-duration tests were not conducted."
          [50] "The Ho2O3 with BaCl2 catalyst at 640 C yielded 57% conversion and 68% selectivity to ethylene."
          [51] "Choudhary et al. at the National Chemical Laboratory, India, have examined strontium and other rare earth oxides deposited on sintered low surface area supports precoated with lanthanum and other rare earth oxides."
          [52] "A Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst showed the highest activity and selectivity for ethane."
          [53] "At 800 C, the Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst was capable of giving 60% conversion of ethane and greater than 80% selectivity to ethylene."
          [54] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
          [55] "At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%."
          [56] "At 670 C, a catalyst containing cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide, and calcining of the catalyst was accomplished in the absence of oxygen at 670 C, gave an 85% conversion of ethane and a 86% selectivity to ethylene (25 vol.% ethane/75 vol.% air at 3 psig and 2400 GHSV)."
          [57] "Addition of a halogen-containing compound, such as methyl chloride, increases ethylene yield."
          [58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
          [59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."
          [60] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [61] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [62] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
          [63] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
          [64] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
          [65] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
          [66] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
          [67] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
          [68] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
          [69] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
          [70] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
          [71] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
          [72] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
          [73] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
          [74] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
          [75] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
          [76] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
          [77] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
          [78] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [79] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
          [80] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
          [81] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
          [82] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
          [83] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [84] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium."
          [85] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."

          [58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
          [59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."
          [60] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [61] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [62] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
          [63] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
          [64] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
          [65] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
          [66] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
          [67] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
          [68] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
          [69] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
          [70] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
          [71] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
          [72] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
          [73] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
          [74] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
          [75] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
          [76] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
          [77] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
          [78] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [79] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
          [80] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
          [81] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
          [82] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
          [83] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."

[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
          [2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
          [3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
          [4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
          [5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
          [6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."







[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
          [2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
          [3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
          [4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
          [5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
          [6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
          [7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
          [8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
          [9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          [10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."

          [13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
          [14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
          [15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
          [17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."

          [19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
          [20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
          [21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
          [22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
          [23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
          [24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
          [25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
          [26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
          [27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
          [28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."

          [32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
          [33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
          [34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
          [35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
          [36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
          [37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
          [38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
          [39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."

          [22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
          [23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
          [24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
          [25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
          [26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."

          [32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
          [33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."

[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
          [2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
          [3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
          [4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
          [5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
          [6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."







[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
          [2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
          [3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
          [4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
          [5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
          [6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
          [7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
          [8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
          [9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          [10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
          [12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
          [13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
          [14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
          [15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."

[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
          [2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
          [3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
          [4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
          [5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
          [6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."







[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
          [2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
          [3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
          [4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
          [5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
          [6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
          [7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
          [8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
          [9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          [10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
          [12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
          [13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
          [14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
          [15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
          [17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."
          [18] "The latter have evolved primarily out of investigations of methane oxidative coupling."
          [19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
          [20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
          [21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
          [22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
          [23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
          [24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
          [25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
          [26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
          [27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
          [28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
          [29] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
          [30] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water."
          [31] "At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%."
          [32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
          [33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
          [34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
          [35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
          [36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
          [37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
          [38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
          [39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."

          [42] "Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity, but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence."
          [43] "Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity."
          [44] "At 34% conversion of ethane, they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene."
          [45] "Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2."
          [46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
          [47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
          [48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."
          [49] "Longer-duration tests were not conducted."
          [50] "The Ho2O3 with BaCl2 catalyst at 640 C yielded 57% conversion and 68% selectivity to ethylene."
          [51] "Choudhary et al. at the National Chemical Laboratory, India, have examined strontium and other rare earth oxides deposited on sintered low surface area supports precoated with lanthanum and other rare earth oxides."
          [52] "A Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst showed the highest activity and selectivity for ethane."
          [53] "At 800 C, the Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst was capable of giving 60% conversion of ethane and greater than 80% selectivity to ethylene."
          [54] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
          [55] "At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%."
          [56] "At 670 C, a catalyst containing cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide, and calcining of the catalyst was accomplished in the absence of oxygen at 670 C, gave an 85% conversion of ethane and a 86% selectivity to ethylene (25 vol.% ethane/75 vol.% air at 3 psig and 2400 GHSV)."
          [57] "Addition of a halogen-containing compound, such as methyl chloride, increases ethylene yield."
          [58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
          [59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."

          [61] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [62] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
          [63] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
          [64] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
          [65] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
          [66] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
          [67] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
          [68] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
          [69] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
          [70] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
          [71] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
          [72] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
          [73] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
          [74] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
          [75] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
          [76] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
          [77] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
          [78] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [79] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
          [80] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
          [81] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
          [82] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
          [83] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."

          [46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
          [47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
          [48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."
          [49] "Longer-duration tests were not conducted."

          [54] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
          [55] "At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%."
          [56] "At 670 C, a catalyst containing cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide, and calcining of the catalyst was accomplished in the absence of oxygen at 670 C, gave an 85% conversion of ethane and a 86% selectivity to ethylene (25 vol.% ethane/75 vol.% air at 3 psig and 2400 GHSV)."
          [57] "Addition of a halogen-containing compound, such as methyl chloride, increases ethylene yield."
          [58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
          [59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."
          [60] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [61] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [62] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
          [63] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."

          [65] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
          [66] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
          [67] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
          [68] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."

          [72] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
          [73] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
          [74] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
          [75] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."

          [79] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
          [80] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
