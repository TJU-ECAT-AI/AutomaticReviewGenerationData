Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are commonly used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized in 1968 using an alumina-supported platinum catalyst. Later, UOP developed the Oleflex process for the production of butadiene and propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially CrOx, have been used industrially and have shown promising results, with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides also being tested successfully.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys, which dilute Pt ensembles and inhibit the adsorption of product alkene, thus suppressing the formation of undesired products like methane. The addition of Ga to the catalyst also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments in this area include the optimization of the Ga/Pt ratio to achieve peak activity and selectivity. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. The literature also discusses the effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurring at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4. Selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, while catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can offer advantages in terms of activity and stability in dehydrogenation processes. The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases. Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon. While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500Â°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600Â°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3Î´ClÏ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild temperature conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without the need for regeneration facilities. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures for economically attractive conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C. Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

However, it discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, is also important, as it influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The industrial application of this catalyst is in the production of light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, which are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemicals and polymers. Recent developments in this field include the preparation and evaluation of a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

Recent developments in this area include the optimization of the Ga/Pt ratio to achieve peak activity and selectivity. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. The literature also discusses the effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurring at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4. Selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, while catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can offer advantages in terms of activity and stability in dehydrogenation processes. The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases. Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon. While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500Â°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600Â°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3Î´ClÏ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild temperature conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without the need for regeneration facilities. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures for economically attractive conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C. Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

However, it discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, is also important, as it influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The industrial application of this catalyst is in the production of light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, which are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemicals and polymers. Recent developments in this field include the preparation and evaluation of a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability for ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications.

Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, while catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can offer advantages in terms of activity and stability in dehydrogenation processes. The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases. Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon. While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500Â°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600Â°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3Î´ClÏ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild temperature conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without the need for regeneration facilities. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures for economically attractive conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C. Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

However, it discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, is also important, as it influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The industrial application of this catalyst is in the production of light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, which are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemicals and polymers. Recent developments in this field include the preparation and evaluation of a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The literature does not delve into the effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

However, it does discuss the effectiveness of platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spine1 in the dehydrogenation of lower paraffins, particularly propane, isobutane, and isopentane. The catalyst was shown to be efficient for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation, with trace amounts of sulfur in the feed suppressing hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Platinum on alumina was found to be more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments. The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are commonly used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized in 1968 using an alumina-supported platinum catalyst. Later, UOP developed the Oleflex process for the production of butadiene and propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially CrOx, have been used industrially and have shown promising results, with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides also being tested successfully.

However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys, which dilute Pt ensembles and inhibit the adsorption of product alkene, thus suppressing the formation of undesired products like methane. The addition of Ga to the catalyst also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments in this area include the optimization of the Ga/Pt ratio to achieve peak activity and selectivity. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. The literature also discusses the effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurring at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4. Selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation.

The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases. Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon. While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500Â°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600Â°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3Î´ClÏ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild temperature conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without the need for regeneration facilities. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures for economically attractive conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C. Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

However, it discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, is also important, as it influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The industrial application of this catalyst is in the production of light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, which are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemicals and polymers. Recent developments in this field include the preparation and evaluation of a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.
