          The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases. Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios. Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period. Since the size of the PtIn nanoparticles is unaffected by catalyst use, catalyst deactivation is attributed to the accumulation of carbon. While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation.

          文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的应用。该催化剂是通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到含有In和Al的煅烧水滑石状载体上制备的。还原后，形成平均直径为1 nm的PtIn双金属粒子。催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性强烈依赖于总In/Pt比。当总In/Pt比为0.48时，活性达到最大，此时对烯烃的选择性接近100%。Pt与In的合金化大大减少了反应过程中沉积的焦炭量。该催化剂显示出高稳定性和选择性，使其成为工业生产轻烯烃的潜在候选催化剂。在723 K以上的温度下还原时，靠近Pt的载体表面附近的In3+离子部分被还原，生成的In原子与支撑的Pt纳米粒子形成PtIn双金属合金。无论催化剂的总In/Pt比如何，Pt和PtIn粒子的平均尺寸约为1 nm。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应的活性是总In/Pt比的强函数。对于两种反应，当总In/Pt比为0.48时，活性达到最大，对应于含12% In的PtIn合金。对于Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48，乙烯和丙烯的选择性几乎为100%。In与Pt的合金化导致在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中C的积累显著减少。在催化剂用于乙烷或丙烷脱氢后观察到焦炭沉积，观察到Pt与In的合金化大大减少了沉积的焦炭量。在673 K以上的温度下在H2中还原时，通过TEM观察到平均直径为1 nm的PtIn双金属粒子。随着总In/Pt比的增加，合金中In的比例线性增加，合金表面能够吸附H2的Pt原子的比例减少。还发现了随着总In/Pt比的增加，In向Pt的电荷转移增加的证据。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应的活性是总In/Pt比的强函数。对于这两种反应，当总In/Pt比为0.48时，即PtIn合金含12% In时，活性达到最大。对于Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48，乙烯和丙烯的选择性几乎为100%。In与Pt的合金化导致在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中C的积累显著减少。当总In/Pt比从0增加到0.48时，碳的积累最显著减少，对于更高的In/Pt比，减少速度更慢。虽然在2 h的流速下，乙烷脱氢的初始活性只损失了0.1%，但在相同的时期内，丙烷脱氢的初始活性损失了20%。由于催化剂使用后PtIn纳米粒子的大小不受影响，催化剂失活归因于碳的积累。虽然在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中形成了小的石墨碳域(30 nm)，但它们积累的位置取决于正在进行脱氢的烷烃的组成。
