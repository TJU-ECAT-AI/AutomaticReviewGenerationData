          The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys, which dilute Pt ensembles and inhibit the adsorption of product alkene, thus suppressing the formation of undesired products like methane. The addition of Ga to the catalyst also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments in this area include the optimization of the Ga/Pt ratio to achieve peak activity and selectivity. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications in the production of light olefins. The literature also discusses the effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurring at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4. Selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.

          文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性。这种催化剂在从乙烷和丙烷形成乙烯和丙烯方面显示出高活性和选择性。性能的增强归因于PtGa合金的形成，这种合金稀释了Pt集合体并抑制了产物烯烃的吸附，从而抑制了不需要的产物如甲烷的形成。向催化剂中添加Ga还抑制了焦炭的形成，导致较低的失活和较高的稳定性。该领域的最新发展包括优化Ga/Pt比以实现峰值活性和选择性。这种催化剂的潜在优势包括高活性、选择性和稳定性，这对于工业应用中轻烯烃的生产至关重要。文献还讨论了在新型Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物支撑上的Pt基催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢的有效性。催化剂性能强烈依赖于支撑中的Ga含量，乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性峰值出现在Ga/Pt = 1.45.4。选择性是Ga/Pt的单调函数，在Ga/Pt = 5.4时接近100%。向进料中添加氢气会由于表面烷基物种的增强氢辅助脱氢而增加烯烃的形成速率。在H2添加的活性峰值之后，H2进料浓度的进一步增加导致烯烃氢化，从而降低了脱氢的净速率。然而，向进料中添加氢气对烯烃选择性的影响相对较小，烯烃选择性保持在近100%。Ga的存在也抑制了焦炭的形成。有趣的是，丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭比乙烷脱氢过程少，而且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的相关性。因此，乙烷脱氢的失活程度低于丙烷脱氢，而前者的焦炭沉积量更高。
