                    The comparative analysis of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, as established from the study of reference \[10.1021/cr5002436_1\], reveals that platinum (Pt) is the predominant noble metal catalyst due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low CC cleavage activity, making it commercially viable. Historically, the Pacol process, using an alumina-supported Pt catalyst, was the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology in 1968. UOP's Oleflex process, employing Pt, was later developed for butadiene and propylene production. Metal oxide-based catalysts, notably CrOx, have been industrially utilized with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides showing promising results, offering alternatives to noble metals. A novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst, as detailed in reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\], demonstrates high activity and selectivity for ethene and propene formation from ethane and propane, respectively, in nonoxidative dehydrogenation. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to PtGa alloys that inhibit product alkene adsorption and suppress undesired products like methane. Ga addition also reduces coke formation, enhancing stability. Optimal Ga/Pt ratios achieve peak activity and selectivity. Hydrogen addition boosts alkene formation but can lead to alkene hydrogenation beyond a certain concentration. Selectivity remains near 100% regardless of hydrogen addition. These catalysts offer potential advantages in industrial light olefin production due to their high performance and stability.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of bimetallic catalysts that combine the advantages of noble metals with those of metal oxides, aiming to achieve higher selectivity and stability under industrial conditions. The exploration of novel supports and the optimization of metal-support interactions could further enhance catalyst performance. Additionally, the investigation of alternative dehydrogenation pathways, such as the use of hydrogen as a co-reactant, could lead to the design of more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. The integration of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology with metal oxide-based catalysts could also be a promising direction, enabling stable activity over extended periods without shutdowns.

                    基于\[10.1021/cr5002436_1\]参考文献的深度分析，我们了解到在非氧化脱氢轻烯烃中，铂（Pt）是主要的贵金属催化剂，因其对石蜡CH键的优异活化和低CC断裂活性，使其具有商业可行性。历史上，使用氧化铝支持的Pt催化剂的Pacol工艺是1968年首次工业烷烃脱氢技术。UOP的Oleflex工艺，采用Pt，后来开发用于丁二烯和丙烯生产。金属氧化物基催化剂，尤其是CrOx，已被工业应用，镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物显示出有希望的结果，为贵金属提供了替代方案。如\[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]参考文献中详述的新型Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂，在非氧化脱氢中从乙烷和丙烷中形成乙烯和丙烯时，显示出高活性和选择性。催化剂的有效性归因于抑制产物烯烃吸附和抑制不需要的产物如甲烷的PtGa合金。Ga的添加还减少了焦炭的形成，提高了稳定性。最佳的Ga/Pt比率实现了峰值活性和选择性。氢的添加提高了烯烃的形成，但超过一定浓度会导致烯烃氢化。无论氢的添加，选择性都保持在接近100%。这些催化剂由于其高性能和稳定性，在工业轻烯烃生产中具有潜在优势。
