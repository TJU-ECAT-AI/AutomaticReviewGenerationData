{"DOC": "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been pivotal in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s, demonstrating high activity for dehydrogenating paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimal cracking, leading to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefin production for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were operational for detergent alkylate production. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, introduced in the 1970s, enabled noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years without shutdowns, facilitating the UOP OleflexTM process for producing light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used, where ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

As of late 2000, multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units were in commercial operation with a combined capacity exceeding 3 million MTA. However, ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not extended to ethane due to the need for more severe conditions that cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene. At 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are employed. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to ethylene. Surface ethoxide can further oxidize to surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalyst selectivity for ethylene or acetic acid can be adjusted by modifying the elemental makeup and reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene is around 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved from methane oxidative coupling investigations. These catalysts primarily produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are absent due to instability at high temperatures. Various metal oxide catalysts have shown high selectivity to ethylene at high ethane conversion, but some exhibit deactivation over time, highlighting the importance of maintaining activity and selectivity for economical processes. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Pt, have been used since the mid-1960s for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, initially for long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. CCR technology, introduced in the 1970s, allows noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years without regeneration shutdowns. Alumina supports, with acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation, are used. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are employed, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is chosen for its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, necessitating an appropriate pore structure for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without regeneration facilities. However, light paraffin dehydrogenation requires higher temperatures for economically viable conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, showing high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenating light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, with high propylene selectivity at temperatures below 700°C. Pt catalysts are widely used industrially for light olefin production, while metal oxide-based catalysts are used for dehydrogenating light paraffins to olefins.

The formation of a PtIn bimetallic alloy with an average diameter of 1 nm enhances the catalyst's stability and selectivity, making it a promising candidate for industrial light olefin production. The alloying of Pt with In decreases carbon accumulation during dehydrogenation, with the most significant reduction observed as the In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48. Catalyst deactivation is attributed to carbon accumulation, with small domains of graphitic carbon forming during the reaction. Despite some activity loss over time, the catalyst's performance highlights its potential for industrial applications in nonoxidative dehydrogenation processes.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008"},
{"DOC": "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been pivotal in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s, with high activity for dehydrogenating paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimal cracking, leading to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefin production for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were operational for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, facilitates the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used, where ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x"},

Ga addition also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments include optimizing the Ga/Pt ratio for peak activity and selectivity. Hydrogen addition to the feed increases alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation, but beyond a peak, it contributes to alkene hydrogenation, reducing dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition has little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%.
