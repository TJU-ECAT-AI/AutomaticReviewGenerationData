Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x"},

Ga addition also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments focus on optimizing the Ga/Pt ratio for peak activity and selectivity. Hydrogen addition to the feed increases alkene formation rates due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation, but beyond the peak, it contributes to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net dehydrogenation rate. Alkene selectivity remains near 100% regardless of hydrogen addition.

{"DOC": "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been pivotal in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s, with high activity for dehydrogenating paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins, leading to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefins production. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were operational for detergent alkylate production. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, introduced in the 1970s, enabled noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years, facilitating the UOP OleflexTM process for producing light olefins, especially propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units were in commercial operation with a combined capacity exceeding 3 million MTA. However, ethane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended due to severe operating conditions causing excessive coking or requiring costly vacuum operations. Metal oxide-based catalysts, including CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene at temperatures of 300-500°C with reducible metal oxides containing vanadium. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to ethylene. Selectivity to ethylene is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved from methane oxidative coupling investigations.
