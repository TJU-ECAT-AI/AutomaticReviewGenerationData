As of late 2000, multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units were in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA.

At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis.

{"DOC": "Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s, with high activity for dehydrogenating paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking, leading to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefins production for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units were in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used, with selectivity to ethylene approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x"},
