Abstract
This paper reports a CO adsorption study on a Pt/TiO2 catalyst reduced at two different temperatures, 473 and 773 K, followed by in situinfrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry. The study is complemented with XPS characterization of the reduced catalysts.
Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in the chemical and petrochemical industry for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis and aromatization reactions.1,2 The catalytic behaviour of platinum in these reactions depends on a number of factors, among which the support plays an important role. Schawb and Schultes found that some supports could modify the catalytic behaviour of the active phases.3 In the late seventies, Tauster et al.introduced the term “strong metal-support interaction” (SMSI) to label the modification of the adsorption ability of metals from groups 8, 9 and 10, supported on partially reducible oxides such as TiO2, after reduction at high temperature (about 773 K).4,5 This effect has been explained on the basis of two different phenomena: on one hand, the coverage of the metal surface by patches of partially reduced support,6–8 on the other, charge transfer between the partially reduced support and the metal.9–11 In any case, this effect has very important implications in several reactions. Vannice and co-workers showed the promoter effect of TiO2 on metals from group 8 after reduction at 773 K12,13 in many reactions involving a carbonyl group or even CO. A model proposed to explain this behaviour included the formation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the partially reduced support (or oxygen vacancies) that could interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group. In this way, the CO bond would become weaker and easier to hydrogenate.12–14
To sum-up, the strong metal–support interaction involves a decrease in the adsorption capacity and a modification in the morphology and electronic properties of the metal surface. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO can be used to provide information about the size and morphology of metal particles.15 Furthermore, CO adsorption microcalorimetry gives useful information about the interaction between the active sites and the probe molecule and, together with adsorption manometry, allows to assess the number of metal surface sites. Therefore, the combined use of these two powerful techniques can supply very interesting information. This paper reports a characterization study of a Pt/TiO2catalyst reduced at two different temperatures (LT 473 K; HT 773 K) by different techniques, with special focus on CO adsorption microcalorimetry and FTIR analysis of adsorbed CO. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the combined application of these techniques to the study of the SMSI effect in the Pt/TiO2 system.
The chemical composition of the catalyst surface was evaluated by XPS. Table 1 reports the binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level for the catalyst reduced in situ under hydrogen at 473 and 773 K for 1 h. A single peak centred at 71.2 and 70.8 eV appears for the catalyst reduced at low and high temperature, respectively, which is assigned to platinum in the metallic state.
Table 1 XPS characterization of Pt/TiO2
Catalyst Reduction temperature/K BE Pt4f7/2/eV Pt/Ti, atomic O2/O1
Pt/TiO2 473 71.2 0.0372 0.1729
773 70.8 0.0144 0.0859
The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratio can be considered as a measure of the platinum dispersion on the titania support. This parameter decreased with increasing the reduction temperature, thus indicating that there was a loss of surface platinum with increasing the reduction temperature. However, no metal sintering was observed in TEM images.
The XPS spectra in the O 1s level for the catalyst reduced at 473 and 773 K exhibit an asymmetric peak that can be deconvoluted into two contributions, this indicating that at least two different chemical states of oxygen are present. Up to five different oxygen species have been reported in XPS studies on TiO2.16 The spectra (Fig. 1) are composed of a peak at high binding energy (O2, 531.5 eV) that is assigned to surface oxygen species such as surface hydroxyl groups, and a second peak at lower binding energy (Ol, 530.1 eV) that corresponds to lattice oxygen in the support.17 The ratio between the intensities of both contributions (O2/O1) (Table 1) shows a strong dependence on the reduction temperature used, in such a way that it decreases with increasing the reduction temperature. This decrease in the amount of surface oxygen species is assigned to the partial reduction of the titania surface shell, that causes a higher amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface. The loss of hydroxyl groups is also observed by infrared spectroscopy, where the intensity of the hydroxyl band is less intense after reduction at high temperature and outgassing for 15 min.

Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on the Pt/TiO2catalyst after reduction at 473 K. In all cases, the catalyst was exposed at 298 K to increasing CO doses until reaching 50 Torr. After introduction of a CO dose of less than 0.1 Torr, the spectrum obtained contains a single band at 2060 cm−1 that can be associated to carbonyls on terrace sites, which are less extended or where the metal atoms are in a less dense close packing arrangement such as in the (100) face. All band assignments can be made from single crystal studies considering coordination number and the number of neighbouring sites likely to result in coupling interactions.18–20

When a second dose was introduced, apart from the former band, one band at 2084 cm−1 followed by a shoulder at 2040 cm−1 and another small one at lower wavenumber (1860 cm−1) appear. The band at 2084 cm−1 can be attributed to CO adsorbed on close packed terrace sites such as (111) patches, the shoulder at low frequency (2040 cm−1) probably reflecting low coordination sites located at edges and kinks.18,19,21,22 Finally, the band centred at 1860 cm−1 can be ascribed to bridge-bonded CO. After that, an increase in the CO pressure results in a blue shift of the bands to 2097 and 2084 cm−1, and an accompanying increase of their intensity. At the highest CO pressure employed, a band at 2188 cm−1 was also observed, which is associated with CO adsorbed on the titania support.23 These species disappeared after evacuation at 298 K.
Fig. 3 shows the differential heat of CO adsorption at 298 K as a function of the coverage for the catalyst reduced at 473 K. Three main regions can be distinguished. In the first one (I) the initial heat of adsorption is 150 kJ mol−1, and dramatically decreases to 110 kJ mol−1. The second region, (II), when the coverage ranges from 0.1–0.6, a plateau with a constant value of 110 kJ mol−1 is obtained. Finally, a third region is found, (III), where the heat of adsorption decreases with coverage until reaching the physisorption region, when the metal surface is saturated. Rather similar initial heats of adsorption results were published for CO adsorption on Pt/SiO2 and Pt/zeolites.24–26

The combined analysis of the CO adsorption results with in situFTIR spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry for the catalyst reduced at 473 K allows us to conclude that the highest heats of CO adsorption are found at the low coverage region (I), with CO being adsorbed on terrace sites, which are less extended or where the metal atoms are in a less dense close packing arrangement, such as in the (100) faces. Region (II), where the heats of adsorption are practically constant with coverage, can be associated with CO adsorbed as linear and bridge-bonded species, with a non-preferential adsorption mode. Finally, the region where the heats of adsorption decrease until reaching the saturation can be preferentially ascribed to CO adsorbed as bridge-bonded species. This is consistent with the order of filling on Pt(111) faces, where at ca. 50% coverage CO is almost completely present in on-top positions, adopting a √3 ×√3-R30 overlayer, whereas at higher coverage a c(4 × 2) structure is produced where the CO molecules are present in both on-top and bridged positions.27
An increase in the reduction temperature up to 773 K induces the SMSI state, which consists in the partial coverage of the platinum surface with titanium suboxides (TiOx). This effect is clearly reflected in the FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO. After reduction at 773 K, the FTIR spectra display absorption bands with lower intensity, as a result of a decrease in CO uptake (Fig. 4). In this case, there is only one band centred at 2076 cm−1, with a broad shoulder around 2040 cm−1. At high coverage, the band is blue shifted to 2086 cm−1. The loss in the highest wavenumber carbonyl band at 2097 cm−1 would be due to the preferential coverage of the partially reduced support on the denser packed platinum crystal faces, depleting the amount of CO molecules adsorbed on these sites. This would explain the loss in the highest wavenumber carbonyl band. A band at high coverage also appears at 1842 cm−1, corresponding to bridge-bonded CO, together with two small peaks at 2188 and 2208 cm−1 which disappeared after evacuation at 298 K and are assigned to CO adsorbed on titania and partially reduced titania, respectively. Unlike the catalyst reduced at 473 K, there is no preferential adsorption mode of the CO adsorbed as linear or bridge-bonded species.

The heat of adsorptionvs. coverage profile after reduction at 773 K (Fig. 5) reveals a lower initial heat of adsorption (≈120 kJ mol−1). The low CO uptake of this catalyst, 6.4 μmol g−1 compared to the 65 μmol g−1 uptake after reduction at 473 K, complicates the analysis, since only a few doses can be introduced. Therefore, it is difficult to describe the tendency with actual precision. The initial heat of adsorption could be higher at lower coverage because the value represented is an average of the heat of adsorption at 0.05 of CO coverage. Comparing both curves at different reduction temperatures it is important to notice how the heat of adsorption is lower than for the sample reduced at 473 K over the full range of coverage, except for the low coverage part where the heats of adsorption are similar. Given the absence of evidences for sintering, a strong interaction of the platinum particles with the partially reduced titania support is suggested as the origin of the low heat of adsorption observed. The profile reflects a progressive decrease in the heat of adsorption with the CO coverage. Taking into account the FTIR results, where no preferential adsorption was observed, this decrease in the heat of adsorption can be due to the energetic heterogeneity of the platinum atoms or to the interaction between neighbouring adsorbed CO species28,29

Conclusions
This work provides the first combined analysis of in situinfrared spectroscopy and adsorption microcalorimetry of adsorbed CO to study the SMSI effect on a Pt/TiO2catalyst. Three different regions for adsorbed CO have been found in the catalyst reduced at 473 K as a function of the CO coverage. At low coverage (region (I)), CO is adsorbed with the highest heats on terrace sites, which are less extended or where the metal atoms are in a less dense close packing arrangement such as in the (100) face. For intermediate coverage (region (II)), the heats of adsorption are practically constant with coverage, and it can be associated with CO adsorbed as linear and bridge-bonded species, with a non-preferential adsorption mode. Finally, at high coverage, the heats of adsorption decrease until reaching the saturation limit, and CO is preferentially adsorbed as bridge-bonded species.
After reduction at 773 K, partially reduced titania preferentially covers the platinum closed packed (111)-type terrace sites, and the heats of adsorption are lower than for the sample reduced at 473 K. This is ascribed to the strong interaction of the platinum particles with the partially reduced titania.
