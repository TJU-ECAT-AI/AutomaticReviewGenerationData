Abstract
The effect of the presence of zinc on the catalytic behaviour of platinum in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal)
and in iso-butane dehydrogenation has been determined in activated carbon-supported catalysts prepared using H2PtCl6 and Zn(NO3)2 as the
metal precursors. The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at
room temperature and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after in situ reduction at 773 K. The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic
ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on
stream. Lower activation energy for this reaction was also obtained, as well as a higher selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol. On the
other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being
more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

1. Introduction
The modiﬁcation of the catalytic behaviour of a noble
metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able
to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the
former is an interesting ﬁeld in heterogeneous catalysis. As
an example, the platinum–tin system supported on alumina
is widely used in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydro-
genation reactions, where it exhibits higher activity and
stability than monometallic platinum catalysts [1]. Some
recent papers have dealt with the use of Pt-Sn/Al2O3
catalysts for the dehydrogenation of iso-butane [2,3], n-
butane [4] and propane [5–7]. Iso-butane dehydrogenation
has also been studied over Pt–Sn supported on silica [8–12]
and on L-zeolite [9,12,13]. Other important applications of
bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts include the oxidation of carbon
monoxide [14–17] and the selective hydrogenation of the
carbonyl bond in a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (acrolein,
crotonaldehyde, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, etc.) to yield
unsaturated alcohols [18–22]. For this latter reaction, it
has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on
the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chieﬂy,
on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in
the metallic state and in oxidised states.
The Pt–Zn system resembles in some aspects the Pt–Sn
system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of
different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others),
which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared
to monometallic platinum. Furthermore, ZnO has n-type
semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction
between platinum and ZnO can be expected. The use of ZnO
as a support for platinum in different reactions is currently
being the subject of an intense research work. For example,
it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve
99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation
of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]. In the ﬁeld of
selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied
Pt/ZnO catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of
crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to
the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the
extent of alloy formation [24]. A similar favourable effect of

zinc has been recently obtained in our laboratory when
studying catalysts prepared by impregnation of zinc-
exchanged NaX zeolites with H2PtCl6 [25]. The bimetallic
catalysts showed enhanced selectivity towards the hydro-
genation of the C O bond of crotonaldehyde as compared to
the monometallic platinum catalyst, although the catalytic
activity was considerably reduced. The results were
explained on the basis of the formation of Pt–Zn alloy
phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was
observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal.
In fact, DFT calculations for the adsorption of ethylene and
formaldehyde on Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Zn(1 1 1) and PtZn(0 1 1)
surfaces have demonstrated that addition of zinc to platinum
weakens the adsorption of both oleﬁnic (C C) and carbonyl
(C O) bonds, but the effect is more important for the former
[26]. This means that whereas on Pt catalysts, the adsorption
trough the C C double bond is highly favoured, on PtZn
catalysts, the adsorption of the carbonyl bond on Pt–Zn
bridge sites is able to compete with that of the C C double
bond. Thus, these results could explain the enhanced
selectivity of Pt-Zn catalysts in the hydrogenation of a,b-
unsaturated aldehydes.
The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective
hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts.
It has been recently reported that Au/ZnO catalysts were also
selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour
phase
hydrogenation
of
crotonaldehyde
[27,28].
The
reaction was carried out at a relatively high temperature
(523 K), and a much higher selectivity to the unsaturated
alcohol was found with Au/ZnO than with Au/SiO2 under
the same reaction conditions. In addition, the selectivity
increased with the reduction temperature, from 523 to
673 K, in such a way that it achieved a maximum of 82% for
Au/ZnO reduced at 673 K. The superior performance of Au/
ZnO catalysts was explained by the formation of interfacial
sites adjacent to Au particles that can activate the reactant
and facilitate its hydrogenation. The same authors have
recently reported the catalytic behaviour of Ag/ZnO
catalysts in the same reaction. Selectivities to crotyl alcohol
of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K [29].
This paper compares the catalytic behaviour of two
activated carbon-supported catalysts, monometallic Pt and
bimetallic Pt–Zn, in two very different reactions: the vapour
phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydro-
genation of iso-butane. Carbonaceous materials are being
more and more frequently used as catalyst supports [30].
They contribute with a high surface area and, in bimetallic
systems such as Pt–Zn, their inertness favours the interaction
between both metals, whereas undesired interactions with
the support are avoided.
2. Experimental
The support used was a commercial activated carbon
from Norit (Norit RX-3). It had a BET surface area (N2,
77 K)
of
1350 m2 g1
and
micropore
volumes
of
0.67 cm3 g1
(N2,
77 K,
Dubinin-Radushkevich)
and
0.30 cm3 g1 (CO2, 273 K, Dubinin-Radushkevich). The
bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential
impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K,
overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation
(100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous
solution of Zn(NO3)26H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of
the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of
1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by ﬂowing
nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid
was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in ﬂowing
helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate:
5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this
treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an
acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration
to load 0.2 wt.%. Once again, the excess of solvent was
removed and the catalyst dried as described previously. No
calcination was carried out at this stage. A monometallic Pt
catalyst was prepared in a similar way for the sake of
comparison. The metallic content in the catalysts was
determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using
a Varian SpectrAA 220FS spectrometer.
The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts, both in
fresh and reduced states, was studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Zinc in the bimetallic catalyst was also
analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), simulta-
neously to the XPS measurements. The spectra were
acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer
equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser and a Mg
Ka (hn = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-
ray source. The powder samples were pressed into small
Inox cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a
pre-treatment chamber and reduced in ﬂowing H2 at 773 K
for 1 h (heating rate: 5 K min1), before being transferred to
the analysis chamber. The analysis of fresh samples, without
any reduction treatment, was also carried out for the sake of
comparison. Before recording the spectra, the sample was
maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure
of ca. 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were
collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were
estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after
subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by ﬁtting the
experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%)
and Gaussian (70%) lines. All binding energies were
referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV, which provided
binding energy values with an accuracy of 0.2 eV.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measure-
ments were carried out on a U-shaped quartz reactor under
a 5%H2/He gas ﬂow of 50 cm3 min1 and about 200 mg of
sample. Hydrogen consumption was followed by on-line
mass spectrometry.
Differential heats of CO adsorption were measured at
300 K in a Setaram BT2.15D heat-ﬂux calorimeter. This
calorimeter was connected to a high vacuum (base pressure
<105 Torr)

system

capacitance manometers for precision pressure measure-
ment (0.5  104 Torr). The maximum apparent leak rate
of the system (including the calorimetric cells) was
105 Torr/min in a system volume of approximately
80 cm3 (i.e. 105 mmol/min). The procedure for micro-
calorimetric measurements used in this study is described
below: each sample (about 0.25 g.) was treated ex situ in
ultrapure hydrogen (99.999%, Air Liquide) for 2 h at 773 K
(heating rate: 2 K min1) and then purged for 1 h at the same
temperature in ultrahigh purity helium (99.999%, Air
Liquide) in order to remove adsorbed hydrogen. Both gases
were further puriﬁed by passage through copper turnings at
473 K and activated molecular sieves (13) at 77 K in order
to remove oxygen and water traces. The treated sample was
sealed in a Pyrex NMR tube capsule and broken in a special
calorimetric cell [31] after the sample had attained thermal
equilibrium with the calorimeter. The microcalorimetric
data were collected by sequentially introducing small doses
(1–10 mmol) of CO (99.5%, with further puriﬁcation, Air
Liquide) onto the sample until it became saturated. The
resulting heat response for each dose was recorded as a
function of time and integrated to determine the energy
released (mJ). The amount of gas adsorbed (mmol) was
determined manometrically from the dose, equilibrium
pressures, and the system volumes and temperatures. The
time required for the pressure to equilibrate in the
calorimeter after each dose was approximately 1–15 min,
and the heat response was monitored for 20–30 min after
each dose to ensure that all heat was detected and to allow
the heat response to return to the baseline value. The
differential heat (kJ/mol), deﬁned as the negative of the
enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of gas adsorbed, was
then calculated for each dose by dividing the heat released
by the amount adsorbed.
The catalytic behaviour of the catalysts in crotonaldehyde
hydrogenation was determined in the vapour phase at
atmospheric pressure, using a dynamic glass micro-ﬂow
reactor equipped with an automatic on-line analysis system.
Before the catalytic measurements, the catalysts (about
100 mg) were reduced in ﬂowing H2 at 773 K for 2 h, with a
heating rate of 2 K min1, and then cooled under hydrogen
to the reaction temperature. Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation
was then performed at 353 K; the reaction mixture, in a
H2/crotonaldehyde ratio of 26, was prepared by passing a
hydrogen ﬂow through a saturator containing crotonalde-
hyde, which was thermostabilised at 293 K. A Carbowax
20M 58/90 25–30 m semi-capillary column was used to
separate the reaction products, which were analyzed by gas
chromatography.
Catalytic behaviour in iso-butane dehydrogenation was
conducted using a stainless-steel apparatus and a glass,
continuous-ﬂow reactor. Iso-butane (99.95%, Air Liquide),
hydrogen and helium as a carrier gas were the gases
employed. Two hundred milligrams of catalysts were used
for each reaction test. All charged catalysts were reduced in
situ in a stream of hydrogen at 773 K for 2 h, with a heating
rate of 2 K min1. Iso-butane reactivity was measured at
773 K, 0.016 atm of iso-butane, 0.098 atm of hydrogen and a
total pressure of 1 atm. The reactor inlet and outlet gases
were analyzed by a Varian Star 3400 Cx gas cromatograph
with a FID detector and a 50 meters HP-Al/S column (J&W
Scientiﬁc) at 313 K.
3. Results and discussion
Theplatinumcontent in the catalysts was 0.22 wt.% forthe
monometallic and 0.20 wt.% for the bimetallic, respectively.
For this latter, the zinc content was 0.92 wt.% and,
consequently, the bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio was 13.7.
The
temperature-programmed
reduction
proﬁles
obtained with the fresh catalysts are reported in Fig. 1.
The TPR proﬁle obtained with the monometallic Pt/C
catalyst shows a broad hydrogen consumption band centred
at about 570 K, which can be ascribed to the reduction of
Pt(II) species to metallic Pt. It has to be noticed that,
although the precursor used contains Pt in its higher
oxidation state (Pt(IV)), it becomes reduced upon contacting
with the carbonaceous support [32,33]. There is another
maximum in hydrogen consumption at higher temperatures
(about 900 K), which is due to the gasiﬁcation of the support
to form methane, a reaction which is catalysed by the
supported platinum.
The
amount
of
hydrogen
consumed
in
the
TPR
experiments is much higher for the Zn-containing catalyst
(Fig. 1). A sharp reduction peak centred at 546 K is obtained
in the TPR of sample PtZn/C. A similar TPR peak has been
reported for the reduction of a Pt/ZnO catalyst prepared
from H2PtCl6, where it was ascribed to the reduction of
oxychlorinated platinum species [24]. As the amount of
platinum in this catalyst is nearly the same than in the
monometallic catalyst, for which a much lower reduction
peak was detected, we ascribe this intense reduction peak to
the joint reduction of platinum and zinc species.

and PtZn/C (Fig. 2b) both fresh and after in situ reduction in

ﬂowing hydrogen at 773 K. In this range, platinum signal is
characterized by a doublet corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 and
Pt 4f5/2 levels, this latter appearing at a higher binding
energy than the former. In the case of the fresh catalysts, a
band appears between the platinum doublet. It is assigned
to Al3+ in alumina, which seems to contaminate the fresh
samples in some extent.
Literature values reported for the Pt 4f7/2 level of
platinum in different oxidation states are as follows [34]: Pt0,
71.0–71.3 eV; K2PtIICl4, 72.8–73.4 eV; K2PtIVCl6, 74.1–
74.3 eV. In this way, the spectra obtained with the fresh
catalysts indicate the presence of Pt(II) species in these
samples, this demonstrating that Pt(IV) in the precursor
compound, H2PtCl6, has become reduced upon impregna-
tion on the carbon support and drying. Anyway, the degree
of reduction is not as high as reported in other studies in
which the impregnation of the carbonaceous support with a
solution of the platinum precursor has been carried out in
aqueous media [32,33]. After reduction at 773 K, the most
intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating
the reduction of platinum to the metallic state.
The oxidation state of zinc in these catalyst cannot be
elucidated by XPS analysis on the basis of the binding
energy of the Zn 2p3/2 transition, due to the close appearance
of bands corresponding to Zn(II) and metallic Zn species
[35]. But interesting information could be drawn from the Zn
LMM Auger transition, as the Auger shift between Zn2+ and
Zn0 is higher than 4.6 eV [36]. Fig. 3 shows the AES spectra
obtained with catalyst PtZn/C, both freshly prepared and
reduced at 773 K. A broad peak can be observed in the
spectrum corresponding to the fresh sample, which seems to
be composed by two contributions, at 984 and 987 eV. After
reduction at 773 K, the broad peak is narrowed (the
contribution at 984 eV disappears) and is centred at a kinetic
energy of about 987 eV. This value, together with the
experimental binding energy of the Zn 2p3/2 level at
1022.2 eV in the XPS spectra, allows to assign this Zn LMM
Auger band to Zn(II) species. The contribution at 984 eV
appearing in the spectra of the fresh catalyst can be assigned
to the presence of chlorine in the catalyst (Table 1). The
kinetic energy value of 984 eV corresponds, taking into
account the Mg anode used, to a binding energy of 280 eV,
which ﬁts the B.E. value of the Cl 2s level. This signal is not
present in the reduced catalysts, as chorine is totally
removed by the reduction treatment (Table 1). Thus,
although the TPR experiment showed the reduction of
Zn(II) species at a temperature lower than 773 K, no clear
evidences of the presence of metallic Zn could be found in
the AES results.

of the metallic particles formed upon reduction to the
external surface of the carbon support, where they are fully
accessible to the X-ray beam. A similar result, although to a
larger extent, are obtained for the bimetallic catalyst. As the
surface atomic concentration of zinc only slightly increases
upon reduction, the atomic Zn/Pt ratio strongly decreases
upon reduction, yielding a ﬁnal value (5.9) which is lower
than the bulk Zn/Pt ratio (13.7).
3.2. CO chemisorption
The adsorption isotherms of CO at room temperature on
the catalysts, after reduction at 773 K, are plotted in Fig. 4.
The monolayer capacity has been obtained from the
extrapolation of the linear branch at higher pressures to
zero pressure, resulting 14.3 mmol gcat
1 for Pt/C and
8.5 mmol gcat
1 for PtZn/C. These amounts correspond to
CO/Pt ratios of 1.3 and 0.83 for the mono- and the bimetallic
catalysts, respectively, taking into account the total platinum
loading in the catalysts and assuming that no CO is adsorbed
on zinc sites. Although the reversibly adsorbed CO has not
been estimated by carrying out a second isotherm after out-
gassing, these high CO/Pt ratios already indicate a high
dispersion of platinum atoms in small particles. The lower
CO capacity for the bimetallic catalyst could be due to: (i)
larger platinum particles; (ii) partial surface coverage of
platinum particles by zinc species; and (iii) formation of
bimetallic Pt–Zn particles, in which surface platinum is
diluted by zinc atoms. The measurement of the heat evolved
when CO is adsorbed can add some light to this point.
Fig. 5 shows a plot of differential heat versus coverage
(amount of gas adsorbed/amount of gas needed to form the
monolayer) for CO adsorption on the reduced Pt/C and PtZn/
C catalysts. For the monometallic Pt/C catalyst, the ﬁgure
shows initial differential heats for CO adsorption of
115 kJ mol1. This value remains up to a coverage of
about 0.3 and then decreases with increasing coverage due to
adsorption on weaker sites and/or interaction between
adsorbed species [37]. The decrease is faster for coverages
higher than 0.75, as the surface is saturated. The addition of
zinc decreases the monolayer capacity of CO on the catalyst,
as indicated above. For coverages close to saturation, Fig. 5
shows that the differential heats of CO adsorption for both
catalysts are the same, but differences arise at lower
coverages, where values for the bimetallic sample are
substantially lower than those for the Pt/C catalyst. The
determination of the initial heat of adsorption for the
bimetallic catalysts from the experimental results is not
accurate. If the ﬁrst experimental point is taken as the initial
heat, a value of 105 kJ mol1 is obtained, which is lower
than the 115 kJ mol1 obtained for the zinc free sample.
However, if the extrapolation of the experimental points to
zero coverage is used to estimate the initial heat, the value
obtained is the same as in the absence of zinc. In any case,
the differential heat of CO adsorption strongly decreases
with coverage, this indicating a heterogeneous distribution
of weaker adsorption sites, induced by the presence of zinc.
These results help to discard the possibility of the lower CO
chemisorption capacity of the bimetallic catalyst being due
to the existence of larger platinum particles, as it has been
shown that the particle size does not have a signiﬁcant effect
on the heat of CO adsorption [38]. It seems clear that zinc
weakens the interaction of CO with the surface platinum
atoms, at least with the main part of them, and this can be

originated by the coverage of the strongest adsorption sites
by zinc, but also by the weakening of the adsorption sites by
a ligand effect caused by alloy formation. Similar results
were obtained by Cortright and Dumesic for CO adsorption
on bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts [37]. In our case, due to the
high bulk Zn/Pt ratio both facts can be expected to account
for the observed results.
3.3. Catalytic activity
Fig. 6 plots the overall catalytic activity (micromoles
of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt)
as a function of time on stream at 353 K for both the
monometallic and the bimetallic catalysts reduced at
773 K for 2 h. The initial data were taken after 10 min on
stream, when the carbon balance was achieved. Prior to
this, a proportion of reactant and products were adsorbed
by the catalyst and no reliable measurements could be
performed.
After an initial period of deactivation, the activity
remained quite stable with time. The monometallic Pt/C
catalyst shows an initial activity of about 420 mmol
s1 g Pt1 and, after a relatively small deactivation, reaches
a steady-state activity of about 300 mmol s1 g Pt1. The
initial activity is nearly two-fold for the bimetallic sample,
although the deactivation is stronger and the steady-state
activity remains in only 160 mmol s1 g Pt1. It is interest-
ing to note that this much higher initial activity is achieved in
spite of the lower amount of surface platinum atoms
available, as determined by CO chemisorption and by XPS
(Pt/C atomic ratio in Table 1). Further deactivation seems to
be related to the higher initial activity, as it has been shown
that it is mainly due to poisoning by CO produced by
decarbonylation reactions [39].
Apparent activation energies (Ea(app)) for both catalyst
have been obtained in the reaction temperature range from
353 to 393 K. When the initial activities have been taken into
consideration, Ea(app) moves from 32 kJ mol1 for the
monometallic catalyst to 21 kJ mol1 for the bimetallic one.
A similar sequence is obtained with the nearly steady-state
values after 100 min on stream: 49 kJ mol1 for Pt/C and
33 kJ mol1 for PtZn/C. These values are similar to those
reported in the literature by Vannice and Sen [40] for
monometallic platinum catalysts with different supports
(13–34 kJ mol1), although the highest activation energy
corresponded to the catalysts which were more selective
towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. Values in
the same range were also reported for PtNi/TiO2 [41] and
PtSn/Carbon black [18]. For PtNi/TiO2, Ea(app) increased
from 29 to 54 kJ mol1 when the nickel loading was
increased and, at the same time, the selectivity towards
crotyl alcohol decreased. Similarly, the Ea(app) reported for
the monometallic Pt/Carbon black catalyst, 31 kJ mol1,
was higher than that for the bimetallic PtSn/Carbon black
sample, 18 kJ mol1, which showed a higher selectivity.
The change of selectivity (%, molar fraction) to crotyl
alcohol (2-buten-1-ol) and to light hydrocarbons (butane and
propane) with time on stream at 353 K for the bimetallic
PtZn/C catalyst is plotted in Fig. 7. The balance to 100%
corresponds
to
selectivity
to
the
saturated
aldehyde
(butanal). Selectivity of the monometallic catalyst (not
shown) does not change with time on stream, producing only
butanal (92%) and light hydrocarbons (8%). For the
bimetallic catalyst, in the ﬁrst stages of the reaction after
the carbon balance has been achieved, selectivity towards
crotyl alcohol is about 10%, but it increases with time on
stream to achieve 25% after 30 min at the expense of butanal.
From then on, selectivity to crotyl alcohol smoothly decreases
and reaches a nearly steady-state value of about 14%.
The higher selectivity of the bimetallic PtZn/C catalysts
towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, as
compared with that of the monometallic counterpart (which
only produces butanal and light hydrocarbons), can be
attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles. In a
recent paper, Ammari et al. [42] reported a study of
crotonaldehyde hydrogenation on Pt/ZnO catalysts in which
up to 85% selectivity to crotyl alcohol was obtained with the
catalyst prepared from H2PtCl6 in which the formation of
bimetallic PtZn particles were detected. This catalytic
behaviour was ascribed to both an effect of alloy formation
and to a promoter effect by chlorine, which would increase
the support Lewis acidity and inﬂuence the electronic
properties of the metal particles. The PtZn/C catalyst
reported in this study showed a lower selectivity to crotyl

alcohol. In this case, although the formation of bimetallic
particles can account for the higher selectivity as compared
with the monometallic catalyst, there is not an effect of
support acidity. Furthermore, it has also to be taken into
account the differences in the experimental conditions with,
for example, a crotonaldehyde partial pressure of only 8 Torr
versus 28 Torr in this study.

the
catalytic
activity
for
iso-butane
dehydrogenation for both catalysts under study. Mono-
metallic catalyst showed higher initial activity than its
bimetallic counterpart (initial conversion: 29.9% for Pt/C
and 21.8% for PtZn/C), although it underwent fast
deactivation during the ﬁrst 3 h on stream. After this period,
deactivation was strongly suppressed and catalytic activity
remained almost stable, reaching a nearly steady-state
conversion of 12%. In the case of bimetallic PtZn/C catalyst,
the activity increased with time on stream during the ﬁrst
hour on stream (probably due to sublimation of some
metallic Zn under reaction conditions) and, after this period,
a slight deactivation was observed. The conversion degree
was 17% after 25 h on stream. With regard to selectivity
toward iso-butene (Fig. 9), the monometallic catalyst
showed an initial value of 70% which increased up to
85%. Selectivity to isomerization products (butenes and
butane) decreased during the experimental run from 18 to
8%, whereas selectivity to cracking products (methane,
propane and propene) decreased from 12 to 7%. In the case
of the bimetallic catalyst, the initial selectivity was 100%,
and remained stable until the end of the experiment.
The improvement in catalytic properties (activity,
selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards
to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by
the formation of Pt–Zn bimetallic particles. Deactivation
in this kind of reactions is due to side reactions (mainly
isomerization and cracking) which produce blocking of
active sites by coke deposition. It has been probed that
these side reactions require large platinum ensembles to
constitute the active sites [12,37]. In contrast, kinetic
results suggest that dehydrogenation reactions can proceed
on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms [12]. Thus,
the formation of Pt–Zn bimetallic particles (based on TPR
and microcalorimetry results) reduces the size of the
surface Pt ensembles, suppresses the undesired reactions
and enhances selectivity and stability. In the case of Pt/C,
deposition of carbon would be responsible of the strong
deactivation observed. Also, the increase in selectivity in
this sample with time on stream can be explained by the
same geometrics arguments. The carbon deposits play
the role of the inactive species that inhibit undesired
reactions. Thus, both the selectivity and stability of the
catalyst improve as a function of time on stream as the
number of large ensembles is reduced by the presence of
carbon.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic behaviour of Pt/C and PtZn/C catalysts
after 773 K reduction has been compared in the selective
hydrogenation
of
crotonaldehyde
and
in
iso-butane
dehydrogenation. In the bimetallic catalyst, the character-
ization results (TPR and adsorption microcalorimetry)
indicate the formation of bimetallic Pt–Zn particles,
although some unreduced ZnO can be also present given
the high Zn/Pt bulk ratio in this sample. In the vapour
phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, the bimetallic
catalyst shows a much higher initial activity, although it
also deactivates faster with time on stream; on the other
hand, the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl
bond to yield crotyl alcohol was improved by the presence
of zinc, achieving a maximum value of 25% which
decreased with time on stream to stabilize at about 15%.
The monometallic Pt/C catalyst yielded no crotyl alcohol
at all. Finally, the bimetallic catalyst was much more
active than the monometallic one in iso-butane dehydro-
genation, exhibiting a 100% selectivity towards the
dehydrogenated product, iso-butene.
