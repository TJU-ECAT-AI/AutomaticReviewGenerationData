1. Introduction
The discovery of the M41S family materials has attracted much
attention in a wide range of research ﬁelds [1–5]. The increased
interest is based on the presence of a well-deﬁned ordered
mesoporous structure which provides to the material with
excellent
textural
properties
together
with
the
absence
of
diffusional restrictions, typically present on microporous materi-
als. Among them, MCM-41 is probably the most widely investi-
gated. Unfortunately, pure siliceous MCM-41 materials exhibit
poor acidity and redox properties which limit their application in
research ﬁelds such as catalysis. This inconvenience has been
overcome by incorporating metal species into the silica matrix.
Although the incorporation of the metal cation into the structure of
the mesoporous molecular sieve commonly produces the partial
deterioration of the long-range ordered structure, the newly
created
active
centres
have
shown
an
improved
catalytic
behaviour for a wide range of organic reactions [6–10]. In this
sense, Tanev et al. described an excellent activity and selectivity for
Ti-containing mesoporous molecular sieves in the oxidation of
phenols to quinones and the conversion of benzene to phenol [6].
In the same way, Corma et al. reported an improved catalytic
activity and selectivity of Sn modiﬁed MCM-41 materials for the
Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to lactones [7]. The improved
behaviour was attributed to the strong polarizing ability of the
newly created Lewis acid centres incorporated into the structure of
the MCM-41.
Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal
cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended
to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14],
Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as Al–Zn
[8,10,17], Al–Fe [8], Cu–Zn [9,14], etc. The huge development of
new materials has spread their possibilities on a wide range of
organic
reactions
(oxidation, alkylation,
hydroxylation,
etc.).
Although the metal incorporation improves the catalytic proper-
ties of the pure MCM-41 material, the real location of the metal
species is quite frequently a matter of debate.
Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control
the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this
sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [18–20] or as a
support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic
behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of
a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding
unsaturated alcohol. The promoting effect of the more electro-
positive metal has been attributed to the formation of bimetallic
Pt–M and/or Pt–MOx entities which favour the adsorption trough

The effect of Zn location and reduction temperature have been studied on pure and Zn-modiﬁed MCM-41
supported Pt catalysts. Experimental results show that incorporation of Zn into the siliceous framework
of the MCM-41 material introduces structural oxidized Zn centres with a high stability towards a
reduction treatment even at high temperatures. XP spectra conﬁrm the high stability of these Zn species
although, at the highest reduction temperature (723 K), a high mobility of the doping cations from
structural positions to the inner wall of the mesopores is observed. Catalytic studies in the
chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde show that the presence of Zn produces an important
decrease in the catalytic activity of the Pt nanoparticles, in accordance with Pt dispersion measurements.
However, the presence of Zn improves the selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol. Compared
with a conventional impregnated PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, structural Zn centres in the doped Pt/ZnMCM-
41 catalysts exhibit a higher polarizing/activation of the carbonyl double bond giving rise to a higher yield
to crotyl alcohol, the product of interest. Additionally, these Zn-modiﬁed MCM-41-based Pt catalysts
show an excellent behaviour in an important industrial reaction such as the dehydrogenation of iso-
butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity of 100%, which remains stable with time on stream.

Another
interesting
reaction for which noble metal catalysts modiﬁed with zinc have
shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light
alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [22–24]. As described above,
the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to
an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst
lifetime.
Taking into account the beneﬁcial effects of zinc and the
improved catalytic behaviour of the metal-doped ordered mesopor-
ous materials, the aim of this work is to study the effect of Zn on the
catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts supported on pure and Zn-
modiﬁed MCM-41. More speciﬁcally, the effect of Zn on the catalytic
behaviour of Pt nanoparticles will be studied either when Zn is
incorporated into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41 or just
deposited on the surface using conventional impregnation methods.
The catalytic behaviour of these materials will be compared in two
important reaction processes such as the chemoselective hydro-
genation of an a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, e.g. crotonaldehyde, and
the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene.
2. Experimental
The preparation and characterization of pure siliceous and Zn-
modiﬁed MCM-41 spheres with two different metal contents
(Zn(A)MCM-41,
2 wt.%
Zn,
Zn/Si
atomic
ratio = 0.02;
and
Zn(B)MCM-41, 4 wt.% Zn, Zn/Si atomic ratio = 0.04) was described
elsewhere [16]. All samples exhibit a well-deﬁned morphology
(spheres) with the long-range order being partly deteriorated for
higher Zn contents (Zn/Si ratio 0.04). Pt/MCM-41, Pt/Zn(A)MCM-
41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by wet impreg-
nation of the original supports using an aqueous solution of
[Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2, with the appropriate concentration to achieve
1 wt.% Pt. The effect of Zn location on the catalytic behaviour was
checked by preparing a conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41
catalyst by wet co-impregnation of the pure siliceous MCM-41
with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)26H2O and [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2,
in order to achieve a metal loading of 1 wt.% Pt and 2 wt.% Zn. After
the impregnation, all catalysts were dried overnight at 373 K and
subsequently calcined in air for 4 h at 673 K.
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried
out in a U-shaped quartz reactor under a 5% H2/He gas ﬂow of
50 ml min1 and about 200 mg of sample. Hydrogen consumption
was followed by on-line mass spectrometry (Balzers QMS 200).
The number of Pt surface
atoms on the catalysts was
determined by hydrogen chemisorption at 298 K in a glass-made
volumetric equipment. Hydrogen uptakes were used to determine
the metal dispersion, H/Pt, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the
chemisorption process.
Differential heats of H2 adsorption were measured at 298 K in a
Setaram BT2.15D heat-ﬂux calorimeter. The equipment was
connected to a high vacuum (base pressure <105 Torr) mano-
metric system employing Baratron capacitance manometers for
high precision pressure readings (0.5  104 Torr). The maximum
apparent leak rate of the system (including the calorimetric cells) was
105 Torr min1
in
a
volume
of
approximately
80 cm3
(i.e.
105 mmol min1). In a common microcalorimetric experiment,
about 250 mg of catalyst were treated ex situ in ultrapure hydrogen
(99.999%, Air Liquide) for 2 h at 723 K (heating rate 2 K min1, ﬂow:
100 ml min1) and then purged for 1 h at the same temperature using
ultrahigh purity helium (99.999%, Air Liquide, ﬂow: 100 ml min1) for
removing adsorbed hydrogen. Both gases were further puriﬁed using
a copper turning trap at 473 K and a 13X molecular sieve trap working
at 77 K for the removal of oxygen and water traces, respectively. The
treated sample was sealed in a Pyrex NMR tube capsule and broken in
a special calorimetric cell [25], once thermal equilibrium with the
calorimeter was achieved. Microcalorimetric data were collected by
sequential introduction of small gas doses (1–10 mmol) of H2
(99.999%, with further puriﬁcation, Air Liquide) until complete
saturation of the sample. The resulting heat response for each dose
was recorded as a function of time and integrated to quantify the total
amount of energy released (mJ). The amount of gas adsorbed (mmol)
was determined manometrically from the dose, equilibrium pres-
sures, and the system volumes and temperatures. The time required
for the pressure to reach the equilibrium in the calorimeter after each
dose was approximately 1–15 min. The differential heat (kJ mol1),
deﬁned as the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole
of gas adsorbed, was then calculated for each dose as the ratio
between the heat released and the amount adsorbed.
The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts both fresh and
reduced at 523 and 723 K was studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The XP spectra were acquired with a VG-
Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemi-
spherical
electron
analyser
and
a
Mg
Ka
(hn = 1253.6 eV,
1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder samples
were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then mounted on a
sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and reduced in
ﬂowing H2 at the desired temperature, before being transferred to
the analysis chamber. Before recording the spectra, the sample was
maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure of ca.
5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were collected at a pass
energy of 50 eV. The intensities were estimated by calculating the
integral of each peak, after subtraction of the S-shaped back-
ground, and by ﬁtting the experimental curve to a combination of
Lorentzian (30%) and Gaussian (70%) lines. All binding energies
were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV, which provided
binding energy values with an accuracy of 0.2 eV.
Catalytic measurements in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of
crotonaldehyde were performed at atmospheric pressure using a
dynamic glass micro-ﬂow reactor equipped with on-line gas
chromatography. Before any experiment, the catalyst (100 mg)
was
reduced
in
ﬂowing
H2
(50 ml min1)
at
the
desired
temperature (523 and 723 K) for 2 h, with a heating rate of
2 K min1, and then cooled under hydrogen down to the reaction
temperature (353 K). The reaction mixture (H2/crotonaldehyde
ratio
of
26)
was
prepared
by
passing
a
hydrogen
ﬂow
(50 ml min1)
through
a
thermostabilized
saturator
(293 K)
containing the crotonaldehyde. A Carbowax 20M 58/90 25–30 m
semi-capillary column was used to separate the reaction products.
Dehydrogenation of iso-butane (iC4) was conducted using a
stainless-steel apparatus and a glass continuous-ﬂow reactor. In
each experiment, around 200 mg of catalyst were reduced in situ in
a hydrogen stream (50 ml min1) at 723 K for 2 h (heating rate
2 K min1). Iso-butane reactivity was measured at 723 K using
0.016 atm of iso-butane, 0.098 atm of hydrogen and He up to 1 atm.
The reactor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed using a Varian Star
3400 Cx gas-chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a
50 m HP-Al/S column (J&W Scientiﬁc).
3. Results and discussion
The chemical composition of the different catalysts was
determined by atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AAS) for Pt and
X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy (XRF) for Zn. As it can be inferred
from Table 1, whereas the percentage of Zn is quite similar to the
nominal value (shown in brackets) in all catalysts, the amount of Pt
increases with Zn content. Apparently, the presence of Zn either
into the silica framework or supported on the silica surface favours

17
the interaction with the Pt precursor, thus favouring its anchoring
to the surface. This can be clearly understood for the Zn-modiﬁed
MCM-41 samples, i.e. Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41,
where the presence of some surface negative charge (Brønsted
acidity) coming from the substitution of Si4+ by Zn2+ will favour the
interaction of the cation precursor [Pt(NH3)4]2+ with the modiﬁed
silica surface.
3.1. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
Fig. 1 shows the H2 consumption proﬁles as a function of
temperature for the four catalysts studied. As it can be observed,
hydrogen consumption in the temperature range applied is nearly
nil for the monometallic Pt/MCM-41 as well as for the Pt/ZnMCM-
41 catalysts, i.e. Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41. The lack
of reduction processes on the Pt/MCM-41 catalyst could be
attributed either to the absence oxidized platinum species, due to
the previous calcination treatment, or most likely to the low
platinum content on this sample (0.5 wt.%). Concerning the Pt/
ZnMCM-41 samples, it is again remarkable the absence of
reduction processes associated with Pt and more especially with
Zn species, taking into account that these samples have a
noticeable Zn loading (2 and 4 wt.%). This behaviour is somehow
different to that reported for Cu-doped MCM-41 materials in
which the reduction of Cu was observed at low temperatures
[9,14]. The reduction process observed was attributed to the
complete accessibility of H2 to the copper species located into the
siliceous framework. However, the incorporation of Zn to these Cu-
MCM-41 materials (CuZn-MCM-41) was able to inhibit the
reduction of Cu2+ at low temperatures even though the well-
known synergetic effects exerted by ZnO on the reduction of
copper on un-supported CuO–ZnO catalysts [26]. Concerning the
reduction of Pt, a shift to higher temperatures was described for Pt
catalysts supported on zeolites upon addition of Zn [23,27].
Consequently, the absence of reduction processes in the Pt/
ZnMCM-41 catalysts reﬂects on one hand the high stability of the
Zn2+ species located into the siliceous framework and, on the other
hand, the possible partial inhibition of Pt reduction in the presence
of Zn.
Temperature-programmed reduction proﬁle corresponding to
the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 (Fig. 1d) catalyst exhibits important
differences. In this sample, two broad hydrogen consumption
peaks, centred at 507 and 1050 K, can be clearly discerned.
According to the literature, the peak at low temperature (507 K)
must be attributed to the reduction of PtOx to Pt, the reduction
process being slightly inhibited in the presence of Zn (the
reduction appears at around 353–373 K on monometallic Pt/
MCM-41 catalysts) [28]. On the other hand, the high temperature
reduction peak corresponds to the reduction of ZnO to Zn, a
reduction process that could be promoted trough hydrogen
spillover from nearby Pt nanoparticles [23].
3.2. H2 chemisorption at 298 K
The hydrogen chemisorption results for the four catalysts under
study both after a reduction treatment at low (523 K) and high
(723 K) temperature are shown in Table 1. These results were
obtained from the irreversible adsorbed hydrogen at 298 K and
considering that one hydrogen atom chemisorbs on one platinum
surface atom. As it can be observed, the amount of hydrogen
irreversible adsorbed (H/Pt) exhibits a maximum for the mono-
metallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst after a reduction treatment at low
temperature, suggesting a fairly high Pt dispersion (93%). The large
platinum dispersion obtained is in accordance with the high
surface area of MCM-41 materials [29]. An increase in the
reduction temperature to 723 K on the monometallic Pt/MCM-
41 catalyst produces a slight decrease in the dispersion value down
to 81%, thus suggesting the partial sintering of the platinum
nanoparticles upon the reduction treatment. Interestingly, the
incorporation of Zn into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41
produces a sudden decrease in the hydrogen chemisorption ability
of the Pt nanoparticles, with dispersion values around 10% even
after a low temperature reduction treatment. XRD and XPS (shown
below) measurements ruled out any drastic sintering of the Pt
particles in the presence of Zn. Thus, either electronic and/or
geometric effects of the surrounding Zn species must account for
the observed behaviour. However, considering that Zn species
must be still located into the siliceous framework, at least after a
low temperature reduction treatment, the sudden decrease in the
Pt dispersion in the presence of Zn should be restricted to the
income of electronic interactions between Pt and Zn. A similar
income of electronic effects (suppression in the hydrogenation

ability) on Pt nanoparticles was described for Pt/CeO2/SiO2
catalysts upon Zn addition, again after a low temperature
reduction treatment (473 K) [19]. The strong interaction observed
between Pt and Zn in the Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts suggests that the
nucleation and growth of the Pt nanoparticles must take place in
the vicinity of the structural Zn centres.
Bimetallic
PtZn/MCM-41
catalyst
exhibits
also
a
drastic
inhibition in the hydrogen chemisorption ability, both after a
low and high temperature reduction treatment. However, this
effect is one order of magnitude higher than that observed on the
doped Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, with the same metal content
(2 wt.% Zn). Thus, this result suggest either a higher degree of
interaction between platinum and zinc or, most likely, the
presence of additional structural effects, i.e. platinum dilution
due to Zn migration and/or PtZn alloy formation [30,31].
3.3. H2 adsorption microcalorimetry
Fig. 2 shows the differential heat versus coverage for H2
adsorption
at
room
temperature
on
Pt/MCM-41
and
Pt/
Zn(A)MCM-41 catalysts after a reduction treatment at high
temperature (723 K). Samples Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 and PtZn/MCM-
41 are not included due to their low H2 chemisorption capacity
which prevents any accurate measurement of the differential heat
evolved. As it can be observed, an increase in the H2 coverage
produces a decrease in the differential heat of adsorption for both
samples. This behaviour is attributed to the adsorption of hydrogen
on weaker sites and/or to the presence of additional interactions
between adsorbed molecules. At high hydrogen coverage, there is
in both cases a sudden decrease in the differential heat (below
40 kJ mol1), thus suggesting the saturation of the accessible
platinum surface sites (the physisorption level is achieved).
Monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows an initial heat of
adsorption of 80 kJ mol1, which is in close agreement with the
value of 90  5 kJ mol1 reported in the literature for hydrogen
adsorption on silica and non-acidic zeolite-supported platinum
catalysts [32–34]. The hydrogen saturation uptake on this catalyst
is 7 mmol g1. It is noteworthy to mention that both the initial heat
and the saturation coverage are strongly affected upon incorporation
of Zn into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41. In fact, the initial
heat of adsorption decreases from 80 kJ mol1 on Pt/MCM-41 to
53 kJ mol1 on the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, this value being even
lower than that reported for a bimetallic PtZn/X-zeolite catalyst
(75 kJ mol1), although with a lower zinc content (0.23 wt.%) [22]. A
similar decrease (8–24 kJ mol1) in the adsorption energy was
described for CO on Pt(1 1 1) single crystals upon addition of Zn [30].
As it can be observed, the decrease in the initial heat of adsorption in
the presence of Zn is also accompanied by a strong decrease in the
hydrogen saturation coverage down to a value of 1.5 mmol g1, in
good agreement with H2 chemisorption data.
In summary, these results conﬁrm that incorporation of Zn into
the siliceous matrix of MCM-41 drastically modiﬁes the physico-
chemical properties of the supported Pt nanoparticles, i.e. there is a
weakening both in the strength and extent of their interaction with
H2. This is a clear indication of the strong interaction established
between both metal species after a high temperature reduction
treatment (723 K). Previous studies described in the literature have
shown that, when added to platinum, zinc can act both as a ligand
(electronic effects) and/or as a dilutant (geometric effects)
[19,22,30]. The presence of electronic effects on Pt/ZnMCM-41
catalysts should prevail after low temperature reduction treat-
ments (473 K), as observed in the chemisorption results. However,
after
a
high
temperature
reduction
treatment
(723 K)
the
additional presence of geometric effects, i.e. Pt dilution by Zn
and/or PtZn alloy formation, cannot be ruled out. In fact, the
possible formation of PtZn alloy phases has been addressed by
several authors after a reduction treatment at temperatures above
400–473 K [30,31]. The presence of geometric effects after a
reduction at 723 K would imply the migration of Zn from structural
positions to the outer surface of the mesoporous channels. In this
sense, XPS results (shown below) conﬁrm the presence of
migration processes for Zn after a high temperature reduction
treatment (723 K).
3.4. X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy
The surface composition of the four studied catalysts both
calcined (un-reduced) and in situ reduced at 523 and 723 K, as well
as the binding energies corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level are
reported in Table 2. In all cases, two values are given for the Pt 4f7/2
binding energy which corresponds to the deconvolution of the
main band in two components. Interestingly, while fresh (un-
reduced) monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst already exhibits more
than 46% of reduced platinum (Pt), Zn-containing samples only
exhibit Pt 4f7/2 binding energies above 72.0 eV, which corresponds
to oxidized platinum species. The presence of Pt0 on the fresh
catalyst must be attributed to the previous calcination treatment,
the reduction from PtOx to Pt being partially inhibited in the
Fig. 2. Differential heat of H2 adsorption at 298 K versus coverage on Pt/MCM-41
catalyst (full squares) and Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst (empty circles), after a
reduction treatment at 723 K.

presence
of
Zn. A
subsequent
reduction treatment at
low
temperature (523 K) produces in all Zn-containing catalysts the
onset of a new component at a lower binding energy (71.0–
71.6 eV), which can be unambiguously assigned to metallic
platinum. After the low temperature reduction treatment, the
proportion
of
reduced
Pt
is
quite
similar
for
all
samples
independently of the presence or absence of Zn (74%). Only
the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 exhibits a lower percentage probably
due to the larger Pt–Zn interaction on this sample. A further
increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K hardly modiﬁes the
Pt 4f7/2 binding energy. In fact, the reduction treatment at high
temperature only affects the relative amount of reduced platinum
with a ﬁnal percentage around 80% for all catalysts. Only the
conventional PtZn/MCM-41 exhibits an additional shift in the Pt
4f7/2 binding energy to lower values (0.4 eV).
The Pt/Si XPS atomic ratio, which can be considered a measure
of the platinum dispersion, is also reported in Table 2. In all cases,
the Pt/Si ratio scarcely decreases with the reduction temperature,
thus suggesting the absence of appreciable Pt sintering after the
different reduction treatments. Contrary to the chemisorption
results, the Pt/Si ratio slightly increases on the Zn-modiﬁed MCM-
41 samples, this effect being more evident on sample Pt/
Zn(B)MCM-41. Apparently, the presence of Zn on the structure
of
MCM-41
enhances
Pt
dispersion,
the
strong
interaction
established between these ﬁnely divided Pt nanoparticles and
the support (Zn-MCM-41) being the reason for their reduced
reducibility at low temperatures. The increased metal dispersion in
the presence of Zn is in accordance with previous studies on
CuZnMCM-41 materials and strongly supports the hypothesis of
the electronic effects as responsible for the decreased chemisorp-
tion ability of Pt nanoparticles after a low temperature reduction
treatment [9]. Only the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst
exhibits a remarkable low Pt/Si ratio, in agreement with H2
chemisorption measurements.
Another important parameter to consider is the Si/Zn atomic
ratio deduced from XPS. In the same way as the Pt/Si ratio, there are
two different behaviours depending on the nature of the support.
On Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts, whereas the reduction treatment at
low temperature (523 K) produce only a slight decrease in the Si/
Zn ratio, a huge increase is observed after a reduction treatment at
high temperature (723 K). The increased Si/Zn ratio suggests a high
mobility of the structural Zn species after a high temperature
reduction treatment, most probably from structural positions to
the inner surface of the mesoporous channels (where XPS cannot
reach them). This behaviour differs considerably from that
exhibited by the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, where a
continuous increase in the Si/Zn atomic ratio with the reduction
temperature is observed. In summary, XPS results show that upon
a reduction treatment at low temperature (523 K) Zn species
incorporated into the silica framework of MCM-41 exhibit a higher
stability
(lower
mobility)
compared
with
the
conventional
deposited Zn nanoparticles. The situation becomes different after
a high temperature reduction treatment (723 K) where a high
mobility of Zn species is observed for all catalysts.
The assessment of the oxidation state of Zn from the binding
energy of the Zn 2p3/2 level is not very useful due to the close
appearance on XPS of the transitions corresponding to Zn(II) and
metallic Zn [35]. This drawback can be overcome using the Zn LMM
Auger transition, as the Auger shift between Zn(II) and metallic Zn
is higher than 4.6 eV [36]. The analysis of the Zn LMM Auger
transition for the three Zn-containing catalysts, both after a low
and
high
temperature
reduction
treatment,
show
a
single
contribution centred at a kinetic energy of 986–988 eV, this
contribution being previously assigned to oxidized Zn (see Fig. 3)
[18]. This ﬁnding suggests that, even after a reduction treatment at
723 K, Zn is present in all catalysts mainly as oxidized Zn. The high
stability of Zn on the Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts is in accordance with
the absence of reduction processes in the TPR experiments, thus
supporting the hypothesis that Zn2+ species are taking part in the
siliceous framework of the MCM-41 material. In the case of the
conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, the presence of some reduced
Zn would be expected due to the absence of any additional
stabilization from the silica support. Unfortunately, AES measure-
ments (Fig. 3c) do not allow discerning any additional contribution
from metallic Zn (commonly appearing in the 991–995 eV range),
in accordance with TPR results.
3.5. Catalytic behaviour
3.5.1. Chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde
The chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is a very
interesting reaction both from an academic and industrial point of
view due to the presence of two conjugated double bonds, a C
C
and a C
O. The products formed under the reaction conditions
used in this study are butyraldehyde, which comes from the
hydrogenation of the C
C double bond; crotyl alcohol, which
comes from the hydrogenation of the C
O double bond; butanol,
which is the completely hydrogenated product produced in a
secondary hydrogenation step; and ﬁnally light hydrocarbons such
as butane and propane coming from further hydrogenation and
decarbonilation reactions. For all catalysts and independently of
the reduction conditions, butyraldehyde and crotylalcohol were
the main products obtained (less than 2% butanol and 2% butane
was observed on the monometallic Pt/MCM-41 in the initial stages
of the reaction, these compounds being absent in the presence of
Zn). Fig. 4a plots the evolution of the overall catalytic activity
(mmoles of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt)
as a function of time on stream for the different catalysts after a
reduction treatment at 523 K. The monometallic Pt/MCM-41
catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than the Zn-containing
catalysts. In all cases, after a pronounced deactivation during the
ﬁrst 20 min on stream, a steady-state activity value is reached.
Both, initial and steady-state activities, strongly decrease in the
presence of Zn (for Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41), this
effect being more detrimental upon an increase in the amount of
Zn. It is noteworthy to mention that the conventional PtZn/MCM-
41 catalyst exhibits the lowest catalytic activity of all samples.
These results are in agreement with the lower number of
‘‘accessible’’ platinum sites on the Zn-doped and bimetallic PtZn

catalysts, as deduced from H2 chemisorption measurements (see
Table 1). The comparison of the TOF, i.e. number of molecules
reacted per Pt surface atom, as determined from H2 chemisorption
measurements, gives rise to a completely different picture
(Table 1). In the initial stages of the reaction (after 10 min time
on stream) the TOF goes from 18 s1, on the monometallic Pt/
MCM-41, to 21 and 14 s1, for the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/
Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts, respectively. Apparently, incorporation of
a small percentage of Zn (2 wt.%) into the silica matrix of MCM-41
slightly improves the catalytic behaviour of the Pt nanoparticles,
this effect being detrimental for higher Zn loadings. Interestingly,
the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a TOF as high as
57 s1. However, this value is meaningless due to the low
uncertainty in the dispersion measurement for this sample. It is
noteworthy to mention that on bimetallic PtZn systems the TOF
values should be considered carefully because the electronic
effects exerted by Zn on Pt not necessarily affects in the same
extent two different processes such as the adsorption of hydrogen
and the adsorption/hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. An increase
in the reduction temperature to 723 K (Fig. 4b) leads to a similar
catalytic activity proﬁle, with the monometallic Pt/MCM-41
catalyst exhibiting by far the highest activity (steady-state activity
of 550 mmol s1 g Pt1). Concerning the TOF, monometallic Pt/
MCM-41 exhibits a similar value to that reported after a low
temperature reduction treatment (17 s1). However, the high
temperature reduction treatment becomes detrimental for the Pt/
Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts with TOF values of
11 and 10 s1, respectively.
Fig. 5a and b plots the evolution of selectivity towards the
unsaturated alcohol (CROALC) versus conversion after the reduc-
tion treatments at low (523 K) and high temperature (723 K),
respectively. After reduction at 523 K, monometallic Pt/MCM-41
catalyst shows the lowest selectivity (0.5%), which remains nearly
unchanged with time on stream. This low selectivity conﬁrms the
high afﬁnity of platinum to hydrogenate the C
C double bond,
thus leading to the formation of the saturated aldehyde. The
incorporation of Zn into the structure of the MCM-41 produces a
noticeable increase in selectivity reaching a value as high as 39%
(conversion of 2–3%) for the Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalyst. Interest-
ingly, for all Zn-containing catalysts the selectivity towards
CROALC formation increases in the ﬁrst minutes of the reaction
(with a decrease in the conversion) up to a maximum, suddenly
decreasing thereafter. This behaviour reﬂects the presence of
secondary reactions on these catalysts, namely the hydrogenation
of crotyl alcohol to butanol. As the catalysts deactivate and the
conversion
decreases,
the
secondary
reaction
becomes
less
favoured and thus, selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases. However,
the deactivation also affects to the active sites responsible for the
hydrogenation of carbonyl double bond to produce crotyl alcohol,
thus explaining the maximum observed in selectivity with

21
conversion. Conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst shows a very
similar behaviour, with a maximum selectivity of 37% at a slightly
lower conversion (1.2%).
A further increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K
produces important changes in all catalysts (Fig. 5b). Mono-
metallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a twelve times increase in
the selectivity (6%), a behaviour commonly attributed to the
better performance of larger Pt nanoparticles [37,38]. The
sintering of the nanoparticles results in a surface rearrangement
of the platinum exposed faces towards a higher number of (1 1 1)
terraces. These close-packed metal surfaces exhibit a lower
ability to coordinate the oleﬁnic (C
C) double bond and, thus, a
higher proportion of these faces in the catalyst surface would
improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol forma-
tion [39,40]. A further increase in the selectivity to crotyl alcohol
is also observed for the Zn-containing catalysts upon a higher
temperature reduction treatment, with values as high as 45 and
42% for Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts, respec-
tively. Interestingly and contrary to this behaviour, the reduction
treatment at 723 K produces on the conventional PtZn/MCM-41
catalyst, together with a decrease in activity, a noticeable drop in
the selectivity from 37 to 22%. The higher selectivity found on
the
bimetallic
sample
after
a
low
temperature
reduction
treatment could be attributed to the presence of oxidized Zn
species, able to polarize the carbonyl bond of crotonaldehyde,
thus favouring its hydrogenation. However, the reduction at
723 K could cause the partial reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn,
with possible PtZn alloy formation, which has been invoked to be
much less effective as a promoter than Pt–Zn2+ entities [41]. On
the Zn-doped MCM-41 catalysts, the higher stability of these
oxidized Zn species (as a consequence of taking part into the
siliceous structure) would justify the higher selectivity found for
these
samples,
even
after
a
reduction
treatment
at
high
temperature.
In summary, catalytic studies on the chemoselective hydro-
genation of crotonaldehyde show that monometallic Pt/MCM-41
catalyst exhibits a high ability towards the hydrogenation of the
oleﬁnic double bond (C
C) to produce butyraldehyde. However,
incorporation of Zn either into the siliceous matrix of the MCM-41
or deposited on the silica surface gives rise to an improved
selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol. The polarizing/
activation ability of these Zn species is highly improved when they
are incorporated into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41,
compared with a conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst. In the
conventional catalyst, the possible formation of PtZn alloy phases,
after a reduction treatment at high temperature (above 523 K),
becomes
detrimental
for
the
polarization/activation
of
the
carbonyl double bond.
3.5.2. Dehydrogenation of iso-butane
Fig. 6a reports the iso-butane conversion versus time on
stream for the four catalysts under study. These experiments
were conducted at high temperature (723 K), 0.016 atm iso-
butane pressure, 0.098 atm hydrogen pressure (H2/iC4 = 6), and a
WHSV of 4.5 h1. The monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows
higher conversion values than the bimetallic samples, although
with a faster deactivation with time on stream (conversion
decreases from 51 to 29% in 24 h). This deactivation was
completely suppressed after Zn addition, although at a lower
conversion level. While both Pt catalysts supported on Zn-doped
MCM-41 show a similar initial iso-butane conversion at around
15%, the conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst results in
a slightly lower value (12%), in agreement with the lower
platinum dispersion on this sample (see Table 1). With regard to
selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst
shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream
up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane)
composing the rest of outlet gases. Presence of Zn both into the
siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes
an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as
high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the
experiment. Again, speciﬁc interactions between Pt and Zn can
be invoked to explain these good results. It is well known that
deactivation and selectivity loss in this kind of processes is due to
side reactions such as cracking and isomerization, which produce
blocking of active sites by coke deposition. It has been probed that
these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles
which constitute the active site [42] whereas, on the contrary, the
desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensem-
bles of surface platinum atoms [43]. Thus, the presence of ionic Zn
in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in
the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a
decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and
thereby enhancing selectivity and stability. Furthermore, it has
been proposed that the presence of ionic species of a second
metal close to platinum can favour the migration of highly
dehydrogenated species (coke precursors) from the active site to
the support [44]. The same arguments can be used for the
conventional PtZn/MCM-41 although, in this case, the possible
formation of a PtZn alloy could also contribute to the enhanced
selectivity and stability.

4. Conclusions
The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,
both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the
surface of well-deﬁned MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity
of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal-
dehyde to crotyl alcohol. Interestingly, the incorporation of these
Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a
higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a
higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing
a carbonyl double bond. In fact, the newly created active sites
further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to
crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/
MCM-41 catalyst. These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts
exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-
butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which
remains stable with time on stream.
