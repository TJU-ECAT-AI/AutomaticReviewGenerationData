Abstract
The inﬂuence of the Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts is analyzed in this paper, not only on the characteristics and properties of both the acid
and metallic function, but on the activity, selectivity and deactivation in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.
The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst modiﬁes both the nature of the acid function (by poisoning the stronger acid sites)
and the metallic phase (by a geometric modiﬁcation the metallic phase). These modiﬁcations would be the responsible for the sharp diminution of
deactivation of the catalysts due to the carbon deposition. Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts inhibits the formation of coke deposited on the metallic
sites and the support.

1. Introduction
Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina are active for naph-
tha reforming and for dehydrogenation of low and high molec-
ular weight parafﬁns [1–3]. One important difference between
naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation catalysts is related to
its acid character. Thus, a given acidity level in the reforming of
hydrocarbon is required to obtain an adequate balance between
the metallic function and the acid function in order to reach the
bifunctional character [4]. In the case of the dehydrogenation
catalysts, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymer-
ization), which are catalyzed by acid centers, must be inhibited
in order to increase the yield of the corresponding oleﬁns. One
way to minimize the undesirable side reactions is to poison the
acid sites of the support by the addition of alkali metal ions
during the preparation of the catalysts. It must be indicated that
several studies on this topic have been reported in the literature.
Thus, Pines and Haag [5] found that alkali metal ions poison
the Lewis acid sites of the alumina. Jiratov´

reported a selective poisoning of the support when alumina is
doped with Na ions. Garc´
ıa Cort´
ez et al. [7], by using ammo-
nia thermodesorption, found that Li, Na and K ions poison the
acid sites of alumina. Moreover, these authors reported that the
strong acid sites are poisoned by the addition of small quantities
of alkali metal ions. Further addition of these ions blocks cen-
ters with lower acid strength. In addition, they also found that
the toxicity of the alkali metals on the acid character of alumina
increases with the ionic radius, though the poisoning effect of
Na, K and Li would not be related only to a steric effect. Besides,
de Miguel et al. [8] found, through FT-IR of pre-adsorbed CO
and NMR measurements, that K and Li addition poisons mainly
the OH conﬁguration of type Ia (OH group bonded to tetra-
hedral Al3+, according to the model of the alumina surface
proposed by Kn¨
ozinger and Ratnasamy [9]), this effect being
more pronounced for K. However, the addition of alkali metals
to alumina not only modiﬁes the acid function, but also could
affect the structure of the metallic phase. In fact, Mross [10]
reported that the alkali metals could change the electronic struc-
ture of the transition metals, and in consequence the activity in
the CO hydrogenation reaction would be enhanced. Park and
Price [11,12] reported that the K addition to Pd/Al2O3 catalyst
increases both the activity and the selectivity in the acetylene

hydrogenation. This behaviour was explained in terms of the
increase in the basicity of the support, followed by an electronic
transference from K to Pd.
Besides, Martin and coworkers [13,14] studied alkali-
promoted Ni/SiO2 catalysts for alcohol synthesis and discussed
the deactivation of alkali promoted catalysts in terms of the sta-
bilization of Ni subcarbonyl species by alkali promoters. The
stability of these systems varies according to the sequence:
K > Na > Li > unpromoted.
In this paper, the inﬂuence of the Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 on
the activity, selectivity and deactivation (by coke formation) in
the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction is analyzed. Besides, a
more detailed study of the effect of the alkali metal addition to
Pt/Al2O3 catalysts on the characteristics and properties of both
the acid and metallic function is reported.
2. Experimental
Catalysts were prepared by using a commercial -Al2O3 (CK
300 from Cyanamid Ketjen) previously calcined in ﬂowing air
at 923 K during 3 h. The alumina samples doped with Na in dif-
ferent concentrations (0.05, 0.15 and 0.25 wt.%) were obtained
by impregnating the support with aqueous solution of NaOH. Pt
(0.3%)/Al2O3–Na catalysts with different Na contents were pre-
pared by successive impregnation: ﬁrst Pt was deposited from an
aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.011 M). The impregnation vol-
ume/support weight ratio was 1.4 ml/g. After the impregnation,
samples were dried at 393 K. Then Na was deposited through
an impregnation with aqueous NaOH solutions (impregnation
volume/catalyst weight ratio: 1.4 ml/g). The Na content in these
samples ranged between 0 and 2 wt.%. Then, samples were dried
at 393 K and ﬁnally calcined at 773 K in a ﬂowing air during
3 h. Moreover, Pt (0.3 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by
alumina impregnation with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6.
The acid properties of pure and Na-doped alumina samples
were determined by isopropanol (IPA) dehydration reaction at
523 K and atmospheric pressure in a ﬂow reactor, using a H2/IPA
molar ratio equal to 18 and a space rate of 32 h−1.
Supported metallic catalysts were characterized by temper-
ature programmed reduction (TPR) using a reducing mixture
composed by H2 (5%, v/v)–N2 with a ﬂow rate of 10 ml/min
and a heating rate of 6 K min−1 from room temperature up to
900 K.
The metallic dispersion was determined by H2 chemisorp-
tion and the state of the metallic phase was also studied by using
test reactions (cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane
hydrogenolysis).TheH2 chemisorptionmeasurementswerecar-
ried out at 298 K in a volumetric equipment. The catalyst was
previously reduced with H2 at 773 K during 3 h, and then it
was outgassed under high vacuum (10−4 Torr) at the same tem-
perature for 1 h. When the sample was cooled down to room
temperature, the chemisorption test began. Test reactions of the
metallic phase were performed in a differential ﬂow reactor at
atmospheric pressure. Cyclohexane (CH) dehydrogenation was
carried out at 573 K, by using a H2/CH molar ratio of 29 and a
CH ﬂow rate of 6 ml h−1. Previous to the reaction catalysts were
reduced at 573 or 773 K. The activation energy in CH dehy-
drogenation for different catalysts was obtained by measuring
the initial reaction rate at 543, 558 and 573 K. The reaction
conditions for cyclopentane (CP) hydrogenolysis were: tem-
perature = 573 K, H2/CP molar ratio = 25 and a volumetric ﬂow
of CP = 6 ml h−1. Previous to the CP reaction, catalysts were
reduced at 573 K. The sample weight used in these experiments
was the appropriate to obtain a CH or CP conversion lower than
7%. The reaction products were only benzene and n-pentane
for the ﬁrst and second reaction, respectively. In both cases, the
reaction products were analyzed by using a gas chromatographic
system (packed column with Chromosorb and FID as detector).
The different catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3–Na) were
tested in the n-butane dehydrogenation in a continuous ﬂow
reactor. Previous to the reaction, the different samples were
reduced under H2 ﬂow at 803 K during 3 h. Then the reactor
was fed with the reactive mixture composed by H2 and n-butane
(H2 ﬂow = 10 ml min−1, n-butane ﬂow = 8 ml min−1). The sam-
ple weight was 0.2 g and the reaction temperature was 803 K in
all cases. The ﬁrst sample of the reactor efﬂuent was taken after
10 min from the reaction beginning. Samples of the reaction
products were analyzed in a GC system (packed column with
20% BMEA on Chromosorb PAW 60/80 and a FID as a detec-
tor). The total reaction time was 120 min. After the reaction, the
used catalysts were characterized by temperature programmed
oxidation (TPO) by using a O2 (10 vol.%)/N2 mixture and a heat-
ing rate of 10 K min−1 in order to determine the coke content.
TPO experiments were carried out in a differential ﬂow reactor
coupled to a mass spectrometer VG Quadrupoles for the anal-
ysis of the desorbed gases. Moreover, catalysts were tested in
n-butane dehydrogenation reaction in a pulse equipment. This
technique was used to obtain information about: (1) the cat-
alytic behaviour in the ﬁrst steps of the reaction, (2) the initial
deposition of coke and (3) the effect of the coke deposition on
the activity and selectivity. The pulse experiments were carried
out at 803 K by injecting successive pulses of pure n-butane
(pulse volume = 0.50 cm3 STP) to the catalytic bed, which was
maintained under He ﬂow (30 ml min−1) between two succes-
sive pulses. Catalyst samples were previously reduced under
ﬂowing H2 at 803 K, during 3 h. Reaction products were ana-
lyzed by a GC system (packed column with Porapak Q and FID
as detector). The carbon amount deposited on the catalyst sam-
ples was determined by using a carbon mass balance in each
pulse.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the acid and metallic phase
The poisoning effect of the alkali metals on the acid prop-
erties of the alumina was studied by means of the isopropanol
(IPA) dehydration to propylene (P) and di-isopropylether (D).
Fig. 1 shows that the isopropanol conversion decreases as the
amount of Na increases. It can also be observed that very low
amounts of Na (0.25 wt.%) added to Al2O3 produce an almost
total inhibition of the dehydration capacity. Moreover, the selec-
tivity to di-isopropylether displays an analogous behaviour since
it decreases with the increase of the Na content, such as Fig. 1

also shows. Taking into account that the ether formation would
require strong acid sites [7], the results obtained in the iso-
propanol dehydration would be in agreement with the higher
poisoning capacity of Na on the stronger acid sites of the alu-
mina.
Fig. 2 shows TPR proﬁles of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3–Na cat-
alysts (with different Na contents). The proﬁle of the undoped
monometallic catalyst shows two peaks: a main one at about
540 K and a second smaller one at about 690 K. It can be
observed that the ﬁrst reduction peak in the Pt/Al2O3–Na
(2 wt.%) catalyst appears at 500 K and it is clearly shifted to
a lower temperature with respect to the corresponding to the
monometallic one. This effect could be due both to an increase of
the metal particle size and a modiﬁcation of the Pt–support inter-
action by the Na addition. It must be also noted that the second
reduction peak is shifted to higher temperatures in Pt/Al2O3–Na
catalysts (with a maximum at approximately 715 K) with respect
to that of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, and its intensity also increases as
the Na content increases. This behaviour could be attributed
to the formation of new species with lower reducibility in
Pt/Al2O3–Na catalysts with respect to the undoped monometal-
lic one, or to a higher interaction of these species with the sup-
port. The concentration of these new species appears to increase
for higher Na contents in the catalyst. Besides, this effect is fol-
lowed by a diminution of the concentration of the Pt species
corresponding to the ﬁrst TPR peak. These results indicate that
the addition of increasing amounts of Na leads to a modiﬁcation
of the metallic phase.
Table 1 shows the metallic dispersion values obtained by
H2 chemisorption, the initial reaction rate (RCH) and the acti-
vation energy (ECH) values in CH dehydrogenation reaction,
and the initial reaction rate values in cyclopentane hydrogenol-
ysis (RCP), for catalysts with different Na contents. Table 1 also
shows that the metallic dispersion values decrease when the Na
content increases. The results on the CH dehydrogenation indi-
cate that the initial reaction rate decreases when increasing Na
amounts are added to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It must be also noted
that the activation energy (ECH) values in this reaction are sim-
ilar for all the catalysts. These results could indicate that the
decrease of both the metallic dispersion and the dehydrogena-
tion activity in doped catalysts would be related to a geometric
modiﬁcation of the Pt particles.
An important decrease of the hydrogenolytic activity with an
increasing Na content is observed in Table 1. Taking into account
the sensitive-structure character of this reaction, the CH dehy-
drogenation results and the H2 chemisorption measurements, it
canbeinferredthattheNaadditionwouldcauseonlyageometric
modiﬁcation of the metallic phase, thus, producing blocking and
dilution effects. In all cases the increasing amounts of Na added
to Pt would produce a parallel diminution of the concentration
of Pt ensembles necessary to catalyze the CP hydrogenolysis.

3.2. Catalytic test in n-butane dehydrogenation
It must be indicated that the main products obtained in the
catalytic tests were: (parafﬁns and oleﬁns) < C4 (derived from
hydrogenolysisandcrackingreactions),1-butene,cis-andtrans-
2-butenes and, in a minor proportion, butadiene. Table 2 shows
the catalytic results [initial n-butane conversion, X0; deactivation
parameter deﬁned as: 100 × (X0 −Xf)/X0, where Xf is the ﬁnal
conversion; initial (S0) and ﬁnal (Sf) selectivities to butenes (1-
butene + cis-2-butene + trans-2-butene + butadiene) of the dif-
ferent catalysts in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction at
803 K in a continuous ﬂow reactor. Results show that when the
Na content added to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases, different effects
are observed: (1) the initial conversion decreases, (2) the deac-
tivation parameter also decreases, and (3) the selectivity (both
initial and ﬁnal) tends to increase.
The lower deactivation capacity of Pt/Al2O3–Na catalysts,
with respect to the undoped sample, could be attributed to the
presence of the alkali metal in the vicinity of the noble metal
with the subsequent diminution of coke deposited on the metallic
phase. In order to verify the validity of this assumption, addi-
tional experiments of n-butane dehydrogenation were carried
out in a pulse system. Results obtained in a pulse system are
shown in Figs. 3–5, which displays the n-butane conversion, the
selectivity to butenes and the relative carbon retention in the
catalyst, as a function of the number of pulses. The n-butane
conversion (Fig. 3) was very high for the ﬁrst pulses of butane
injected to the undoped Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, and it decreased as

and Pt/Al2O3–Na (0.5–2 wt.%) catalysts.

the Na content in the catalyst increased. For the Pt/Al2O3–Na
(2 wt.%), the conversion was low and almost constant along the
successive pulses. The selectivity to butenes (Fig. 4) increased
with the pulse number and it was higher for the Na-doped cata-
lysts.
The relative carbon retention (Fig. 5) was very high for the
undoped Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and it decreased as the Na content in
the catalyst increased. It must be indicated that the relative reten-

tion of carbon represents the cumulative amount of deposited
coke on catalysts after each pulse and respect to the amount
of coke deposited on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst after 10 pulses of
n-butane injected to the reactor. Fig. 5 shows a very important
carbon retention in the undoped Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, mainly in the
ﬁrst pulses, this effect being less pronounced in the catalysts with
Na contents of 0.5 and 1 wt.%. At higher Na contents (2 wt.%),
the carbon retention is very low, but it must be taken into account
that the butane conversion is also low in this catalyst.
Thedeactivationparametersobservedintheﬂowexperiments
between the different catalysts (without and with Na) decrease
from 78% for the undoped sample to 48% for the Pt/Al2O3–Na
(2%) one. However, the differences of carbon retention between
the undoped and doped catalysts (observed in the pulse experi-
ments) are very important, such as it can be seen in Fig. 5. Hence,
the main carbon deposition (and deactivation) is produced dur-
ing the initial stage of the reaction. In the case of the ﬂow system,
the ﬁrst sample of reaction products was taken at 10 min from
the beginning of the reaction, and it would correspond to a cat-
alytic surface with an important amount of deposited carbon.
In consequence, the avoidance of the coke deposition is shown
more clearly in pulse experiments than in ﬂow ones.
The conversion of n-butane is very high after injection of the
ﬁrst pulses to a Pt/Al2O3 sample, but the selectivity to butenes is
very low (this means that the selectivity to hydrogenolysis is very
high). Similar results were obtained during the initial stages of
propane dehydrogenation using a similar monometallic catalyst
[15]. As the number of pulses increases, the conversion (Fig. 3)
and the percentage of carbon retained in each pulse (Fig. 5)
decrease with respect to the previous pulse and the hydrogenoly-
sis quickly decreases leading to an increment in the selectivity to
butenes (Fig. 4). Results introduced in Figs. 3–5 indicate that at
the beginning of the reaction (ﬁrst pulses) for Pt/Al2O3 catalyst,
the hydrogenolysis and cracking are the main reaction routes.
In this case the metallic phase shows very high activity, but it is
quickly poisoned by coke with the consequent catalyst deacti-
vation. After the injection of several pulses, the hydrogenolytic
activity decreases and the selectivity to butenes increases. Com-
paring the Pt/Al2O3 sample with the Pt/Al2O3–Na ones in
pulse experiments, the following trend in stability (related to
deactivation and carbon retention) of the catalyst with the
increase of Na content in the catalyst was observed (see
Figs. 3 and 5):
Pt/Al2O3–Na (2 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3–Na (1 wt.%)
> Pt/Al2O3–Na (0.5 wt.%) > Pt/Al2O3
Similar results were obtained for catalysts supported on K-
doped Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation [16]. In this paper,
the authors reported that K addition to Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3
catalysts signiﬁcantly decreases the catalyst deactivation by low-
ering the amount of coke deposited on the support and metal,
and producing coke with a lower polymerization degree.
Catalysts tested in n-butane dehydrogenation during 2 h at
803 K, were characterized by temperature programmed oxida-
tion (TPO) experiments, and their proﬁles are shown in Fig. 6.
The TPO proﬁle of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows two peaks: the for-

alysts. Carbon contents (obtained from the TPO results) are shown between
brackets.
mer, appearing at lower temperatures, would correspond to coke
placed near to the metallic surface, and the latter at higher tem-
peratures, would be due to the carbon deposited on the support
[17]. The second peak that corresponds to the coke deposited on
alumina, is clearly decreased in the Na-doped catalysts, where
the acid sites were poisoned by the alkali metal addition. A
decrease of the coke deposited on the metal (ﬁrst peak) as the
Na concentration in the catalysts increased, is also observed in
Fig. 6.
The formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst, with the
consequent catalyst deactivation, is produced by the polymer-
ization of the oleﬁns formed during the dehydrogenation. The
polymerization reaction is catalyzed both by acid and metallic
sites. In the last case (catalysis by the metallic function) the reac-
tion behaves as a demanding one and it is carried out on the same
type of sites as the hydrogenolysis, thus, requiring determined
ensembles of Pt atoms. From our results, it has been shown that
the Na on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts not only poisons the acid sites
of the alumina but also produces a geometric modiﬁcation of
Pt sites as well, thus, decreasing the hydrogenolytic ensembles
responsible for the coke deposition. These important modiﬁca-
tions in the catalyst structure by the Na addition would cause
the pronounced diminution of the deactivation by the carbon
deposition.
Finally, Table 2 also shows the initial and ﬁnal ratios between
the selectivity to 1-butene and 2-butenes (cis-2-butene + trans-
2-butene) [S1-B/S2-B]. Results indicate that there is a certain
modiﬁcation in S1-B/S2-B ratio when the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is
doped with increasing Na concentrations. The modiﬁcation of
the S1-B/S2-B ratio was also observed in the pulse experiments,
which give information about the ﬁrst stage of the reaction, such
as it was observed in Fig. 7. From the results obtained in both
ﬂow and pulse experiments, we can say that the isomerization
of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butenes would be slightly higher
for Na-doped catalysts than on undoped samples. In these doped
catalysts, the isomerization would be mainly carried out only on

metallic sites because of the poisoning of the acid sites by the
presence of the alkali metal [5–8].
4. Conclusions
1. Results obtained in the isopropanol dehydration reaction
would indicate the poisoning effect of Na on the stronger
acid sites of the alumina.
2. The addition of increasing amounts of Na to Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst leads to a geometric modiﬁcation of the metallic phase.
3. These modiﬁcations in the catalyst structure by the effect of
Na addition would cause the pronounced diminution of the
ensembles for hydrogenolysis and carbon formation, thus,
producing catalysts with a lower deactivation by coke depo-
sition.
4. Two different types of coke are deposited on the alumina: a
fraction deposited near to the metallic surface, and another
one adsorbed on the support. Na addition to Pt/Al2O3 cat-
alysts inhibits the formation of both types of coke, mainly
that originated on the acid sites of the alumina, which are
poisoned by the alkali metal.
5. There is a modiﬁcation in the ratio between the selectivity to
1-butene and that of 2-butenes when Pt/Al2O3 is doped with
increasing Na concentrations.
