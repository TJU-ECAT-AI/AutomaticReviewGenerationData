1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. This catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的应用。该催化剂通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到含有铟的水滑石状支持物Mg(In)(Al)O上制备而成。在673 K以上的温度下在H2中还原时，通过TEM观察到平均直径为1 nm的PtIn双金属粒子。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应的活性和选择性强烈依赖于In/Pt的总比。对于两种反应物，当In/Pt的总比为0.48时，活性达到最大值，在此In/Pt比下，对烯烃的选择性接近100%。在使用催化剂进行乙烷或丙烷脱氢后观察到焦炭沉积，观察到Pt与In的合金化大大减少了沉积的焦炭量。
