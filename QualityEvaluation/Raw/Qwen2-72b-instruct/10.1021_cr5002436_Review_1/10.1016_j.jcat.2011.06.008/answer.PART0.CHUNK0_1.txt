1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction at temperatures above 723 K, part of the In3+ cations present near the support surface and proximate to Pt are reduced and the resulting In atoms form a PtIn bimetallic alloy with the supported Pt nanoparticles. The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst. The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的应用。该催化剂通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到含有In和Al的煅烧水滑石状载体上制备。在723 K以上的温度下还原时，靠近Pt的载体表面附近的In3+离子部分被还原，生成的In原子与支撑的Pt纳米粒子形成PtIn双金属合金。无论催化剂的总In/Pt比如何，Pt和PtIn粒子的平均尺寸约为1 nm。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应的活性是总In/Pt比的强函数。对于两种反应，当总In/Pt比为0.48时，活性达到最大，对应于含12% In的PtIn合金。对于Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48，乙烯和丙烯的选择性几乎为100%。In与Pt的合金化导致在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中C的积累显著减少。
