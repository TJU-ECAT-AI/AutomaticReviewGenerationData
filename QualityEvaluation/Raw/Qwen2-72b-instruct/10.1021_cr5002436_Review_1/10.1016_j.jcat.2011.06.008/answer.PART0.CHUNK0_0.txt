1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this ratio, the selectivity to alkene is nearly 100%. The alloying of Pt with In greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited during the reaction. The catalyst shows high stability and selectivity, making it a potential candidate for industrial applications in the production of light olefins.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型的Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的应用。该催化剂是通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到含有In和Al的煅烧水滑石状载体上制备的。还原后，形成平均直径为1 nm的PtIn双金属粒子。催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性强烈依赖于总In/Pt比。当总In/Pt比为0.48时，活性达到最大，此时对烯烃的选择性接近100%。Pt与In的合金化大大减少了反应过程中沉积的焦炭量。该催化剂显示出高稳定性和选择性，使其成为工业生产轻烯烃的潜在候选催化剂。
