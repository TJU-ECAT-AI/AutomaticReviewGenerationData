1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the use of a Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. This catalyst is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al. Upon reduction, bimetallic particles of PtIn are formed, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%. Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的应用。该催化剂是通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到含有In和Al的煅烧水滑石状载体上制备的。还原后，形成平均直径为1 nm的PtIn双金属粒子。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢反应的活性和选择性强烈依赖于总In/Pt比。对于两种反应物，当总In/Pt比为0.48时，活性达到最大，此时对烯烃的选择性接近100%。在催化剂用于乙烷或丙烷脱氢后观察到焦炭沉积，观察到Pt与In的合金化大大减少了沉积的焦炭量。
