Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does mention that Pt supported on various carriers, including L-zeolite, is a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes. It also notes that PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are commercial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The effectiveness and industrial applications of these catalysts are not directly compared in the literature.

1. 文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实提到，Pt支持在各种载体上，包括L-沸石，是烷烃脱氢为烯烃的有希望的催化剂。它还指出，PtSn支持在氧化铝上或Cr2O3支持在氧化铝或氧化锆上是丙烷脱氢为丙烯的商业催化剂。这些催化剂的有效性和工业应用在文献中没有直接比较。
