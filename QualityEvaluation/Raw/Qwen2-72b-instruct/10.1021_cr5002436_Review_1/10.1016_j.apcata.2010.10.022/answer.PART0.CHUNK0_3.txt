1. The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does mention that Pt supported on various carriers, including L-zeolite, is a promising catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes. It also notes that PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are commercial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The effectiveness and industrial applications of these catalysts are not directly compared in the literature.

1. 文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实提到，Pt支持在各种载体上，包括L-沸石，是烷烃脱氢为烯烃的有希望的催化剂。它还指出，PtSn支持在氧化铝上或Cr2O3支持在氧化铝或氧化锆上是丙烷脱氢为丙烯的商业催化剂。这些催化剂的有效性和工业应用在文献中没有直接比较。
