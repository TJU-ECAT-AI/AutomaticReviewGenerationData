R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic *
Department of Chemical Engineering University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison, W153706, Country, Received 9 January 1995: revised 27 March 1995; accepted 27 March 1995 Abstract Catalysts prepared by supporting tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation and resistance to deactivation at 673-773 K.
M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin is present as Sn 2 +. Potassium displaced by Sn 2+ from ion-exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst. The addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydroge- nation activity and selectivity. It is suggested that tin and potassium in Pt/Sn/K-L decrease the size of the surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane. The high activity for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts may be attrib- uted to stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species by the zeolite pore structure and/or by excess potassium, which enhances the rate limiting dissociation of isobutane.

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for alkenes such as propene and isobutene. Isobutene is in partic- ularly high demand as a feedstock for the production of oxygenated compounds required in reformulated gasoline, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl tert-butyl ether, and tert-butyl alcohol.
It is known that addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts increases the selec- tivity for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (e.g., [ 1-5] ). For example,we showed in a previous investigation that tin interacts with silica-supported plat- * Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 1-608) 2621095, fax.

inum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles and decreases the size of surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydroge- nated hydrocarbon species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions [ 1 ]. The attenuation of these reactions enhances the selectivity for the dehydrogenation reaction that can proceed over small ensembles of surface plati- num atoms.
In the present study, L-zeolite-supported platinum and Pt/Sn catalysts were investigated in kinetic, microcalorimetric, and M6ssbauer spectroscopic studies.
The rationale for this work is that small ensembles of supported platinum should be highly selective for dehydrogenation reactions, and L-zeolite can stabilize clus- ter-sized platinum particles within its channels (e.g., [6,7] ). We will show in this report that while platinum supported in L-zeolite is highly active for isobutane conversion, this catalyst is not selective for isobutane dehydrogenation. However,the combination of tin and platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a catalyst that exhibits high activity and high selectivity for isobutane dehydroge- nation to isobutene. We suggest that tin and excess potassium reduce the size of the platinum ensembles in L-zeolite, while the pore structure of L-zeolite promotes the reactions of isobutane over platinum. For purposes of comparison, this paper also presents results of our studies of silica-supported Pt and Pt/Sn catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
A 1.2 wt.-% Pt/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by ion-exchange of Cab-O-Sil, using the method of Benesi et al. [ 8 ]. The extent of exchange was controlled by adjusting the pH of a Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and silica slurry with an aqueous, basic solution of Pt (NH3) 4 (OH) 2" The resulting material was filtered, washed with deionized water,and dried overnight in air at 390 K. Tin was added to the 1.2 wt.-% Pt/SiOz catalyst by evaporative impregnation of a solution of tributyltin acetate in pentane. After impregnation with tin, the catalysts were dried overnight in air at 390 K, treated with flowing oxygen at 573 K for 2 h, followed by reduction for 2 h in flowing hydrogen at 773 K. The Pt:Sn atomic ratio of the Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst was 1:2.8.
A t wt.-% Pt/Ba-L-zeolite catalyst was provided by Dr. J.T. Miller of Amoco Oil Corporation. The L-zeolite support of this catalyst was exchanged to its capacity with Ba. The preparation and characterization of this Pt/Ba-L catalyst are reported elsewhere [9].
Several Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts were prepared by the sequential impregnation of tin and platinum. These catalysts contained Pt:Sn atomic ratios of 1:2, 1:2.5, and
1:3.5. The K-L-zeolite (Tosoh) was first calcined in dry air at 873 K for 18 h,
followed by incipient wetness impregnation with a solution of tributyltin acetate in methanol under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Following impregnation with tin, the

zeolite was dried in air at 393 K for 2 h and then treated in a flowing mixture of 25 mol-% oxygen in helium at 573 K. The dried Sn/K-L-zeolite was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4 (NO3)2 (Aldrich) under a dry nitrogen atmosphere, followed by heating in air at 393 K for 2 h and treatment in flowing helium at 573 K for 1 h. The resulting Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts were reduced in a flowing mixture of 10% hydrogen in helium at 773 K for 6 h. The results of elemental analyses (Galbraith Laboratories, Inc.) of the supported Pt and Pt/Sn catalysts are shown in Table 1.
Excess potassium was added to the 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst by incipient wetness impregnation with aqueous KOH (Aldrich) under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The impregnated catalyst was dried in air at 393 K for 2 h and then reduced for 1 h at 773 K in a flowing mixture of 10% hydrogen in helium. The Pt:Sn:K(excess) atomic ratios of this catalyst were 1:2:2, and this catalyst is designated as Pt/Sn/
(K)/K-L.
2.2. Reaction kinetic studies
Reaction kinetic studies of isobutane conversion were conducted using a stain- less-steel apparatus and a quartz, down-flow reactor. Helium (Liquid Carbonic) was employed as a carrier gas, and it was purified by passage through copper turnings at 473 K, followed by activated molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. Isobutane (Liquid Carbonic, 99.5%) was treated by passage over beds of reduced Oxytrap (Alltech) and reduced Ni on alumina at 373 K to remove oxygen and sulfur impurities, respectively. Hydrogen (Liquid Carbonic) was treated by passage through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard) and a bed of molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K.
The reactor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed by a HP-5890 gas chromatograph with FID detector and a 10 foot 15% Squalane Chromsorb PAW column at 323 K.
2.3. MOssbauer spectroscopy
M6ssbauer spectra of l l9Sn were collected using an Austin Science Associates Model S-600 M6ssbauer spectrometer, connected to a microcomputer with a PCAII data collection board. The spectrometer was operated in the constant-acceleration mode, with a 10-mCi single-line y-ray source of Ca 119mSnO3 (Amersham). Detec- 104

tion of the 23.88 keY y-rays was achieved with a Xe-CO 2 proportional counter. A
0.05 mm thick palladium foil was placed between the source and detector to filter
25.04 and 25.27 keV X-rays from the source. A mixture of BaSnO3 and /3-tin
powder was used to calibrate the Doppler velocity drive. Chemical shifts are reported relative to BaSnO3 at room temperature.
2.4. Microcalorimetry
Differential enthalpy changes of hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption at 403 K were measured using a Setaram C-80 heat flux microcalorimeter. Values of the differential enthalpy changes of adsorption, AH,a are negative, and it is con- venient to define the heat of adsorption as being equal to -AHad. A detailed description of the microcalorimetric apparatus can be found elsewhere [10,11].
Hydrogen (Liquid Carbonic) was purified for these measurements by passage through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard), followed by molecular sieves (Davison) at 77
K. Carbon monoxide (Matheson 99.9%) was purified by passage through a heated
trap (573 K) packed with quartz wool and dried by passage through molecular sieves at 77 K.
3. Results
3.1. Reaction kinetic studies
Initial isobutane reactivities were measured over all catalysts at 673 K, 12.5 Torr ( 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) of isobutane, 75 Torr of hydrogen and a total pressure of 760 Torr. The catalysts were first reduced with hydrogen at 773 K for l h and then cooled to 673 K before kinetic data were collected. The equilibrium conversion of isobutane to isobutene is 7.0% at these conditions. The results of these measure- ments are summarized in Table 2. The turnover frequencies are based on the number of surface platinum atoms determined from saturation hydrogen uptakes at 403 K, as reported in Table 3. This table also presents saturation uptakes of carbon monoxide at 403 K. Sharma et al. [9] reported a saturation hydrogen uptake of 20 /zmol/g for the Pt/Ba-L catalyst at 403 K.
It can be seen in Table 2 that the Pt/Ba-L catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity for isobutane conversion compared to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Specifically,the Pt/Ba-L catalyst exhibits turnover frequencies for conversion of isobutane and for production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane that are an order of magnitude higher than the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. The Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit sig- nificantly lower turnover frequencies for the conversion of isobutane and for pro- duction of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane than the Pt/Ba-L catalyst. In particular, the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with increasing tin content of the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, and the isobutane conversion is

In agreement with previous studies [ 1 ], the addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the production of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane. The sup- pression of isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions over the Pt/Sn/K-L cata- lysts leads to an enhancement in the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Moreover, the addition of excess potassium to the 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst leads to a further decrease in the isomerization and hydrogenolysis rates and a corresponding enhancement in the dehydrogenation selectivity.
Isobutane dehydrogenation rates were measured over selected catalysts under conditions chosen to insure that these rates were not influenced by equilibrium or transport limitations [ 12-14]. These kinetic measurements were conducted at 723 K, 12.5 Torr of isobutane, 75 Torr of hydrogen, and a total pressure of 760 Tort over sieved catalyst fractions (80-120 mesh) mixed with Cab-O-Sil at a dilution ratio greater than 19:1. Isobutane conversions were maintained less than 10% of the equilibrium dehydrogenation conversion of 24.5%. Fig. 1 shows that the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst is over 2 times more active for isobutane dehydrogenation than Table 3 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide saturation uptakes at 403 K Catalyst wt.-% Pt Coverage (/xmol/g)

[] 1:2:2 Pt/Sn/(K) K-L-zeolite (0.58% Pt) and [] 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L (0.58% Pt) K-L catalyst exhibits an initially high dehydrogenation turnover frequency of 18 s- t, but it deactivates to the activity of the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst over a period of 6 h. The 1:2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit higher initial dehydrogenation rates than the 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst, and the dehydrogenation rates over these catalysts decrease moderately over time. Importantly, the 1:2.5 Pt/ Sn/K-L and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation turnover frequencies after extended periods of time on stream. Fig. 3 shows that the addition of excess potassium to the 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst increases the dehydrogenation rate and increases the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation.
Activation energies and kinetic orders for isobutane dehydrogenation were deter- mined over sieved and diluted 1.2 wt.-% Pt/SiO2, 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2, and 1:3.5 Pt/ Sn/K-L catalysts. All data were collected at dehydrogenation conversions less than 15% of the equilibrium values. Table 4 shows the apparent activation energies for isobutane dehydrogenation determined at temperatures between 673 and 773 K,and at 12.5 Torr isobutane, 75 Torr hydrogen, and a total pressure of 760 Torr.
Table 5 lists the hydrogen reaction orders determined at various temperatures and hydrogen pressures for the catalysts at an isobutane pressure of 12.5 Torr. The isobutane dehydrogenation reaction was first order with respect to isobutane pres- sure over all catalysts at a hydrogen pressure of 75 Torr and over a range of isobutane pressures between 5 and 100 Torr.

3.2. MOssbauer spectroscopic studies
MOssbauer spectra were collected over a 1% Sn/K-L catalyst after oxidation and reduction steps. After drying overnight at 393 K, the Sn/K-L catalyst was treated in a glass M6ssbauer spectroscopy cell with a flowing mixture of 25 vol.-% oxygen in helium at 573 K for 1 h. Fig. 4a shows the M6ssbauer spectrum of this oxidized Sn/K-L catalyst collected at room temperature. The spectrum can be fit with a singlet attributed to the presence of Sn 4 + and a weaker doublet attributed to Sn 2 +.
Table 6 lists the M6ssbauer parameters of these Sn 4+ and Sn 2+ species. The oxidized Sn/K-L sample was subsequently treated in flowing hydrogen at 773 K for 6 h. The spectrum of this reduced Sn/K-L catalyst, presented in Fig. 4b, shows a predominant Sn 2+ doublet and a weaker Sn 4+ singlet. Table 6 shows that the relative spectral area of the Sn 2 + doublet increased from 8 to 91% after the 6 h treatment in hydrogen. This table also shows for comparison the M6ssbauer para- meters for SnO and tin supported on silica after reduction with hydrogen.
M6ssbauer spectra were collected for the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst after treat- ment in hydrogen at 773 K for 8 h. The MOssbauer spectrum of this reduced catalyst,shown in Fig. 4c, consists of a predominant doublet attributed to Sn 2 + and a weaker singlet attributed to Pt/Sn alloy particles.
3.3. Microcalorimetry
Catalyst samples were pretreated for microcalorimetric studies by heating in the microcalorimeter cell under vacuum over a period of 3 h to 673 K, followed by evacuation at this temperature for 1 h. After cooling the cell to room temperature,500 Torr of hydrogen was admitted into the system, and the cell was heated to 723 K over a period of 3 h and then held at this temperature for 2 h to reduce the catalyst.
The gas in the cell was evacuated and replaced with fresh hydrogen several times

This earlier investigation reported values of 92 and 140 kJ/mol on platinum at 403 K for the initial heats for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption, respectively. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the initial heats and saturation coverages for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption are significantly lower over the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K- L catalysts compared to 1.2 wt.-% Pt/SiO2. For example, the initial heats for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption over 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L are equal to 63 and 126 kJ/mol, respectively.

The kinetic data of the present study show that Pt/Sn-K-L catalysts exhibit high activity for isobutane dehydrogenation (Fig. 1), high selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation (Table 2), and sustained activity at reaction conditions condu- cive for coking (Fig. 2). Importantly, the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibits higher dehydrogenation rates than the Pt/SiO2 and 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 1),but the heats and uptakes for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption are similar for the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5.

111 Platinum supported in L-zeolite generally exhibits high activity and selectivity for converting n-hexane into benzene e.g. [15-18], and these catalysts contain cluster-sized platinum particles within the channels of the zeolite e.g. [6,7]. Miller [5] showed, however, that isobutane reacted over a Pt/Ba-L catalyst to produce predominately hydrogenolysis products. Table 2 shows that the Pt/Ba-L catalyst of this present study exhibits a significantly higher rate for isobutane conversion compared Pt/SiO2, and the higher isobutane activity is because of higher isomeri- zation and hydrogenolysis reaction rates. Accordingly, the Pt/Ba-L catalyst exhibits poor selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. It was also observed that the Pt/Ba-L catalyst deactivated during these kinetic studies at 673 K. These results suggest that cluster-sized platinum particles in L-zeolite possess sufficiently large surface platinum ensembles to catalyze isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions of isobutane.
Miller [5] showed that the addition of tin to a Pt/Ba-L catalyst decreased the rate of isobutane hydrogenolysis, but this Pt/Sn/Ba-L catalyst required sulfiding to inhibit both hydrogenolysis and isomerization. In the present investigation, it was found that it is possible to prepare a catalyst containing platinum and tin in K- L-zeolite that is highly selective for isobutane dehydrogenation, without the neces- sity of sulfiding.
Table 2 shows that isobutane hydrogenolysis and isomerization are inhibited when tin is combined with platinum in L-zeolite or on silica. M6ssbauer spectro- scopic studies in our previous investigation [1] showed that Sn interacts with platinum to produce a Pt/Sn alloy on silica. Microcalorimetric investigations of this previous study [ 1 ] showed that the addition of Sn reduces the number of sites that strongly interact with hydrogen or carbon monoxide, due to preferential block- ing of stronger adsorption sites by tin or weakening of adsorption sites due to ligand effects. However, strong adsorption sites were still present on a Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst that exhibited high dehydrogenation selectivity [ 1 ]. We suggested in this previous investigation that tin decreases the size of surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions [ 1 ]. For example, metal-catalyzed isomerization of isobutane occurs through a bond-shift mechanism involving the formation of ca,/-triadsorbed intermediates [19-22].
Foger and Anderson [22] showed that neopentane isomerization over platinum is structure sensitive and proceeds through a bond-shift mechanism over larger plat- inum particles. Hydrogenolysis reactions require the removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane molecule and the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface intermediates before the rate-limiting C-C bond rupture [ 10,23,24]. Analogous to the hydrogenolysis reaction, a large ensemble of surface platinum atoms is required for decomposition reactions leading to coke formation [ 25 ]. The M6ssbauer spec- troscopic results of this study show that tin interacts with platinum in L-zeolite to form Pt/Sn alloy particles (Fig. 4c). As with Pt/Sn/SiO2, it is suggested that tin 112

reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles in L-zeolite, thereby inhibiting hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions (see Table 2).
The enhanced activity and selectivity of Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst for isobutane dehy- drogenation can be attributed at least partially to the presence of potassium. The M6ssbauer spectrum (Fig. 4c) of reduced Pt/Sn/K-L indicates that tin is present as Sn 2 in the L-zeolite as well as interacting with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles. Fitch and Rees [26,27] showed that ferrous cations can exchange with potassium in the micropores of L-zeolite upon dehydration. Similarly, we suggest that Sn 2 can interchange with K + in the zeolite structure, and potassium displaced from ion exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst. It was shown in a previous study [2] that the addition of potassium to Pt/ Sn/SiO2 increases the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation and enhances the dehy- drogenation selectivity. This previous investigation [2] suggested that the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 suppresses hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions by further decreasing the size of the surface platinum ensembles. The present study shows that the addition of excess potassium to the 1:2 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst has a similar function, i.e., it decreases the isomerization and hydrogenol- ysis rates (Table 2) and enhances the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3).
Table 3 shows that increasing the amount of tin in Pt/Sn/K-L did not have a significant effect on the uptakes of adsorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
MOssbauer spectroscopic results show that most of the tin in Pt/Sn/K-L interacts with the K-L-zeolite, while a smaller fraction of tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the addition of excess tin does not necessarily increase the amount of tin interacting with platinum.
We proposed in our previous investigation [2 ] the following general scheme for isobutane dehydrogenation over small ensembles of surface platinum atoms: C4Hjo+2* C4Hq-H* (Step 1)
C4H* + *  C4
H* + H*
(Step 2) C4H* , C4Hs + * (Step 3)
H2+2"  2H*
(Step4) We have reported elsewhere that deuterium is readily incorporated into isobutene in flowing gas mixtures of isobutane with D 2 and in mixtures of isobutene with D2 over silica-supported Pt and Pt/Sn catalysts at 723 K [ 28 ]. These deuterium tracing results suggest that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are equilibrated and Step 1 is rate limiting under the reaction conditions used in our studies. The following rate expression is appropriate for this case:klPc4Hj0 rate -- (1 + KfK PH2) 2 This rate expression gives zero order kinetics with respect to hydrogen pressure at conditions of low hydrogen coverages. Table 5 shows that the dehydrogenation

113 reaction over 1.2 wt.-% Pt/SiO2 is nearly zero order with respect to hydrogen at 723 K and hydrogen pressures less than 350 Torr.
The negative orders with respect to hydrogen pressure for isobutane dehydro- genation over Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts, as shown in Table 5, suggest that the addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 increases the hydrogen coverage on the dehydrogenation sites.
Paffett et al. [29] showed that the presence of tin suppresses both the adsorption and desorption rates of hydrogen on Pt( 111 ) surface. The higher apparent activation energy for dehydrogenation over the Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst, shown in Table 4, may thus be attributed to the larger influence of hydrogen pressure on this catalysts, i.e.,the apparent rate constant has a contribution from the equilibrium constant K4.
Bileon et al. [30] reported an activation energy of 128 kJ/mol for propane dehy- drogenation over platinum powder at conditions of higher hydrogen coverages (633 K at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1500 Torr).
The lower dehydrogenation rates over Pt/Sn/SiO 2 compared to Pt/SiO2 suggest that the addition of tin decreases the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane.
Xu et al. [31 ] showed that the presence of tin in the surface layer of Sn/Pt( 111 ) surface alloys decreases the binding energy of molecular isobutane. A decrease in binding energy of this molecularly adsorbed precursor state would decrease the rate for the dissociative adsorption of isohutane.
Both the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L and 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalysts have a small number of sites for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption, and these sites adsorb hydrogen and carbon monoxide weakly compared to Pt/SiO2, as shown in Fig. 5.
However, the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibits a significantly higher turnover frequency for dehydrogenation than the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 1 ). More- over, the negative orders with respect to hydrogen (Table 5) and higher apparent activation energy (Table 4) suggest a significant influence of hydrogen pressure over the 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation. The higher dehy- drogenation rates over the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts suggest that the zeolite pore struc- ture and/or the presence of potassium promote the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane. For example, a molecularly adsorbed isobutane precursor state may be stabilized by the zeolite pore structure or by excess potassium, thereby increasing the rate for the dissociative adsorption of isobutane. Furthermore, the rates of isobutane isomerization and hydrogenolysis are significantly higher over Pt/Ba-L compared to Pt/SiO2 catalysts, and these higher rates may also be explained by stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane species in the zeolite pore structure.
5. Conclusions
Effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene can be pro- duced by supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite. These catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation after extended periods of time at temperatures from 673-773 K. M6ssbauer spectroscopic results show that 114

l-115 some of the tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles in reduced Pt/ Sn/K-L catalysts, while the remainder of the tin interacts with the zeolite and is present as Sn 2+. It appears that Sn 2+ can interchange with K + in the zeolite structure, and potassium displaced from ion exchange positions in the zeolite may interact with Pt/Sn particles in the catalyst. The addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts further enhances the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
It is suggested that tin and potassium in Pt/Sn/K-L decrease the size of surface platinum ensembles, thereby inhibiting isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of isobutane. Microcalorimetric measurements show that the heats and uptakes for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption are similar for the 1:2.8 Pt/Sn/SiO2 and 1:3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts; however, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibits a signif- icantly higher rate of isobutane dehydrogenation. The zeolite pore structure and/ or the presence of potassium in the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst appear to promote the rate of dissociative adsorption of isobutane.
