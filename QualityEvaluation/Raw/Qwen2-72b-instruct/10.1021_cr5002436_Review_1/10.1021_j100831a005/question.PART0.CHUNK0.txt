Stamford Laboratories, American Cyanamid Company, Stamford, Connecticut Received August IS,1959 Two types o f platinum-alumina reforming catalysts, impregnated and cogelled, have been examined by means of HI adsorption and X-ray line-broadening techniques. The catalysts were examined (1) fresh, ( 2 ) coked, (3) regenerated, (4) mildly sintered, ( 5 ) severely sintered and (6) reactivated after the two levels o f sintering. The adsorption was shown to de- cline after coke had been deposited in a naphtha reforming reactor. A careful burn-off of the coke restored the adsorption to at least one-half of its original level. Mild sintering, in a partial steam atmosphere, caused a large decrease in adsorption which was partially recovered after reactivation under a high pressure of oxygen. On the other hand, sintering at one atmosphere of steam caused a decrease in adsorption which was essentially irreversible despite attempts at reactivation.
The adsorption results on fresh, sintered and reactivated catalyst are interpreted by assuming (1) the existence of two types o f platinum aggregation-monolayer for impregnated catalyst, pseudo-spherical for cogelled catalyst, and (2) that Hz is ad- sorbed as atoms at the surface interstices between platinum atoms. Platinum particle sizes are derived that are in good agreement with X-ray line-broadening values. The adsorption of H z per gram of platinum was found to be virtually in- dependent o f platinum concentration within either of the two groups o f catalysts investigated.
Introduction It has been of interest to this LTboratory to study the nature of platinum supported on alumina, in the concentration range appropriate for a re- forming catalyst. One of the properties which most obviously affects the performance of any heterogeneous catalyst is the surface area of the active mnteriul. A study was therefore started to determine the surface area of platinum available in supported catalysts of the type used in reforming.
Determination of the surface area of one com- ponent in a multiple component catalyst has been done previously by Emmett and Brunauer' for iron on a promoted ammonia-synthesis catalyst, by means of carbon monoxide adsorption, and later2J by the same method for cobalt on kieselguhr and for nickel on aluminum oxide. These determinations were made on catalysts in which the active com- ponent occupied a large percentage of the surface.Boreskov and I<arnaukhov4 applied the technique to a lorn concentration (0.2 to 0.5%) of platinum supported on silica gel. They used hydrogen as their adsorbate. Spenadel and Boudart5 have most recently used hydrogen adsorption to study Pt-A1203 catalysts. Their conclusions regarding Pt dispersion are in general agreement with those presented in this paper.All previous work compared the adsorption on the catalysts with that on the pure metal, in order to determine the surface area of the metal in the catalyst. ,4lthough this is probably valid for large particles, it would seem that surface properties of very small particles must be different from the bulk metal. For this reason, a different approach to the interpretation of adsorption results is presented.Experimental

0.1 to O.8yO. The material was dried overnight at 120,
calcined from 205 too5'33" in four hours and calcined an ad- ditional hour at 593 . The finished catalyst was stored in a sealed container.
"Cogelled" Catalysts.-Alumina sol containing ca. 5% solids as A1203 was cogelled by the simultaneous mixing of the sol .and chloroplatinic acid (C.P. grade) with aqueous ammonia. The resulting gel was dried overnight at 120,and then calcined to 260'.After grinding, blending with a lubricant and pelleting into 1/*" X I/*" cylinders, the gel was recalcined to 593' in four hours and held at that tem- perature for one hour. The platinum content of the rata- lyst was adjusted by varying the amount, of platinum solu- tion used in the cogcllation step. The final product had a BET surface area of ea. 210 m.z/g. and a porosity of 0.56 Coking of Catalysts.--A number of fresh catalyst samples were coked for one or five days in a naphtha re- forming reactor operating under the folloiving conditions:feed-Mid-Continent naphtha (93-176' boiling range);liqnid hourly spare velocity, 2.0 hr.-I;av. temp., 483O;pressure, 200 p.s.i.g.;

(once-through).
Regeneration of Coked Catalysts.-Coked catalysts were regenerated by calcining them in a muffle furnace from 200 to 593" in no less than four hours. This allowed the coke to be burned off slowly.
Steaming of Catalysts.-Two types of steaming pro- cedure were used to sinter the catalyst samples. The mild steaming was performed by injecting water into a circulat- ing air furnace held at 705'.The partial pressure of the water vapor in the furnace was determined to be 0.35 at- mosphere. More severe steaming was accomplished by vaporizing water, in the absence of $r, into steel tubes packed with catalyst and kept at 750 . Here, the water pressure was necessarily 1 .

F. Reactivation of Catalysts.-A number of stcanied cata-
lysts were reactivated by heating them to 620" in a static 60 p.s.i.g. 0 2 atmosphere for two hours.

z Adsorption Measurements.-The chemisorption of hydrogen was measiired volumetrically at a pressure of 8-9 mm. The sample holder was a small Pyres bulb of a size such that the sample completely filled it; it was joined to the rest of the system by a ground glass joint. The supply of reagent grade hydrogen was connected to the sys- tem through three stopcocks which served as a dosing sys- tem. A similar system was employed for helium. The manometer was of 10 mm. Pyrex tuhing, and used dibutyl phthalate as the manometer fluid. The large bulbs were of 500, 1000 and 2000 cc. volumes and were calibrated with water before mounting. They were not thermostated but were well insulated. The system was designed such that adsorption could be measured at constant pressure (within 10%). The initial pressure in the system was 9-10 mm.
(about 13 cm. dibutyl phthalate) and before admitting gas to the sample, the volume of the system was adjusted by closing off one or more of the large bulbs. The volume was chosen so that the expected adsorption would cause a drop of 10% or less in the pressure. I f the drop exceeded lo%,

209 an additional bulb was opened, restoring the pressure to within 1
O
y o of the initial value. The dibutyl phthalate manometer was read to 0.05 mm. with a Gaertner cathe- tometer; this allowed measurement of the amount adsorbed to 0.570.
All measurements were made at 200 = k lo. The tem- perature was controlled by a Leeds and Northrup Electro- max Controller. Sample sizes were in general from 7-10 g., with smaller samples taken when quantities were limited.
It was found that after outgassing of the sample at low temperaturw (300") for 16 hours, adsorption o f H1 started at a moderate rate and continued at about this rate even after three hours. It was felt that the more rapid the initial ad- sorption and the smaller the secondary adsorption, the cleaner the Pt surface. AIaxted6 found that poisoning of Pt with sulfur greatly reduced the initial rate o f adsorption of Hz, compared to unpoisoned Pt. Outgassing at 400" or 500" improved the situation in that a rapid initial adsorp- tion was obtained, but a slow adsorption still continued after three hours.
A 20 second exposure to hydrogen at 500" and 10 mm. followed by 16 hr outgassing at 500' gave the best results insofar as eliminating the slow adsorp- tion was concerned. Kith this treatment, the rate of change of adsorption after two hours was 27, or less per hour. Hy- drogen treatment for longer than one minute at 500' did not diminish this rate but did decrease the amount adsorbed,possibly beciause o f sintering. No difference was found for treatment times less than one minute.The standard treatment, then, for any catalyst sample was: 2-3 hours outgassing, Kith a mercury diffusion pump,followed by 20 seconds eyosure to H g at 10 mm., and 16 hours outgassing, all at 500 . The pressure after outgassing,was less than 10-6 mm. The temperature was then lowered to 200, the free volume in the sample holder measured with helium, and the hydrogen sorption started. The uptake of hydrogen was followed with time, and the amount ad- sorbed calculated to STP. The adsorption recorded for a given sample was taken at the two hour point.In Fig. 1 is shown a typical adsorption us. time curve.Curves obtained at a variety of temperatures with no hy- drogen pre-reduction are also shown. A portion of the iso- therm is shown in Fig. 2, which indicates that a possible variation o f 10% in the region o f 9 mm. gives a very small change in adsorption (about 2%).
H. X-Ray Diffraction Line Broadening.-Determina-
tions of the platinum crystallite size in various catalysts were made by means o f standard line-broadening techniques.
The instrument used was a Phillips diffractometer employ- ing Cu Iia radiation with a Ni filter. Measurements were madeoon the Pt (111) reflection plane corresponding to a
2.26 A. lattice spacing.
Results and Discussion Hydrogen adsorption was measured on several catalysts; the results are shown in Table I.
Several blank determinations were made on pure AI&, on A1203 impregnated with HC1, and on a coked A1203.
All of these adsorptions were 0.003 cc. (STP)/g. or less. Since this is about the ex- pected experimental error, the adsorption on A1203 was considered to be zero, and no corrections were made to the catalyst results.
The effect of steaming catalysts as well as sub- sequent oxygen treatment can be seen from Table I.Steaming at '703' and 0.35 atm. HzO decreases the adsorption of the cogelled catalyst ca. SO%, whereas that of the impregnated catalyst decreases approxi- mately 50%. It is possible by oxygen treatment to restore the cogelled samples to a substantially higher adsorption, but the adsorption of the im- pregnated catalyst remains at about 507, of the fresh catalyst. More stringent steaming (750,1 atm. LO) decreases the adsorption by both types of catalysts to a very lorn value, and oxygen treatment has a negligible effect. - (61 B .\fax.trd J Clem Sflc., 2?03 (1931). 4 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Time, min.Fig. 1.-Hydrogen adsorption at 200" on 0.58% Pt cogelled catalyst. - 5 10 15 20 Pressure, mm.Fig. %-Hydrogen adsorption at 200' on 0.58% Pt cogelled catalyst.

In order to interpret the adsorption measure- ments in terms o f Pt crystallite size, it was de- sirable to measure the adsorption on pure plati- num of known surface area. Two measurements on platinum black were unsuccessful because the platinum sintered under the conditions of the ex- periment.

This is in good agreement with Boreskov and Karnaukhov4 who found an adsorption of 0.11 cc. (STP)/m.2 on sintered platinum sponge at 250 and the same pressure. Their Pt was pre-reduced. Unfortu- nately, these results do not seem to be applicable to the catalysts under study. I f one assumes all (100) faces on the surface of the foil, the observed ratio of H atoms adsorbed to surface Pt atoms is
0.55. In the fresh impregnated catalysts meas-
ured, the ratio of H atoms adsorbed to total Pt present is greater than one. It seems clear that finely divided Pt is very much more efficient in hydrogen adsorption than is bulk platinum.
In order to make a correlation, therefore, be- tween the hydrogen chemisorption and the size of the platinum crystallites, it is necessary to con- sider the probable mode of adsorption of hydrogen on platinum. It is assumed that hydrogen ad- sorbed on platinum under the conditions cited here exists primarily as atoms.
Although Boreskov and Karnaukhov did not find that the adsorption became constant, even up to one atmos- phere, their measurements indicate that there is an extremely strong adsorption which is complete at a few millimeters o f Hg pressure. This suggests that at the pressure used in this investigation, all of the primary adsorption eites are filled. Since we find that on some catalysts more H atoms are adsorbed than there are Pt atoms present, there must be more than one adsorption site per Pt atom. Mignolet* has already indicated that hy- drogen is probably adsorbed above the spaces be- tween atoms, rather than on top o f each atom.
In a hexagonal face there are tmo such sites per atom, neglecting edge effects. It is concluded,therefore. that at least on some faces two H atoms are adsorbed for each surface Pt atom.
However, because o f the wide discrepancy be- tween H/Pt ratios for fresh impregnated and cogelled catalysts, it was felt that there might be a fundamental difference in the manner in which the platinum was arranged on the surface of these (7) See, for example (a) D.

It is hard to see how the adsorption of chloroplatinic acid on an activated alumina surface at low (<1.0%) concentrations can result in any- thing other than a discontinuous monolayer of chloroplatinate ions. Reduction of such a surface in a hydrogen atmosphere would necessarily result,at least initially, in a discontinuous monolayer o f
platinum metal. We believe this to be the case for impregnated catalysts.
Using the previously stated concept that the ad- sorption of hydrogen atoms occurs at the inter- stices of the platinum surface, we may calculate the H/Pt ratio to be expected from a monolayer of any given dimensions. For simplicity v e  shall con- sider the monolayer to consist of n rows o f clcse- packed platinum atoms, with a radius o f

I
f the opposite assumption is made mean particle dimensions obtained are approximately one-half of those given below in the range o f 0 to 20 fi.
We have not observed H/Pt ratios corresponding to monolayer particles o f a larger size.
The general equations for the number o f total atoms T and the number of surface interstices I ,were obtained as a function o f the number o f rows n in the monolayer (1,2).

I = 2n2 - 5n + 3 Curve A in Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the ratio, I / T ,  and the mean dimension of the monolayer. In future discussion, the ratio, I / T ,is taken to be identical to the ratio, H/Pt.
A very likely alternative to the monolayer type o f array is a roughly spherical form such as might be expected if a chloroplatinic acid solution mere precipitated in the presence of alumina. In this case, one might well expect to produce three-dimen- sional aggregates o f platinum. or of some complex of platinum, which is subsequently reduced to the metal. These aggregates will exhibit a different I/T ratio dependence on particle dimension than was found for the monolayer because o f the vastly different surface-volume relationships which char- acterize these arrays. Specifically, it was assumed that the three-dimensional array was generated as a close-packed cubic mass with a hexagonal base,having AT atoms in the side of the hexagon. Suc- cessive layers are placed on the base with proper regard for cubic symmetry and tapering off to an approximation of a hexagonal pyramid.
Using such a model, a new set of equations (3,4) can be derived which relate I and T to the variable N ,  as well as to the mean dimension of the aggre- gate which was taken as the distance between opposite sides of the base.

From Fig. 3, hydrogen adsorption values for various catalysts were interpreted in terms of either a monolayer or aggregate array of eome mean dimension. Most of these same cata- lysts were also examined for average Pt crystallite size by X-ray line-broadening measurements.
In Tables I1 and 1 1 1 ,a comparison is made between average Pt particle dimensions as determined by the two methods.

The effective lower limit with our instrument was approximately 50 8. because (1) we were using the strongest Pt diffraction line which is superimposed on a y- A&O8 line and (2) the Pt concentration was at most 0.58$&. Both of these factors made the line- broadening measurements extremely difficult. The only large discrepancy between values from the two methods is noted for the impregnated catalyst steamed at 0.35 atm. The area under the Pt dif- fraction peak of this sample is approximately one- half that for either the severely steamed or the reactivated samples. It seems likely that a con- siderable portion of the platinum in this mildly steamed catalyst is of a particle size too small to be detected by our X-ray technique. H z adsorp- 5 hr. 350 100-150 .. 180 tion is, however, not limited in this way; on the contrary, the particle size derived from H z adsorp- tion measurements is based on particles o f all sizes.The results for this sample strongly suggest a bimodal particle-size distribution, one mode of which is invisible with the X-ray technique.The close agreement between values for the same catalyst after severe steaming indicate that the distribution has reverted to one with a single maximum, and that the bimodal form is a tran- sient one. ,4
similar phenomenon was observed by Selwood, et d , l o who studied the Ni-SiOz system by means o f thermomagnetic analysis. Here also,moderate sintering produced a transient bimodal particle-size distribution.
We feel that the dimensional values obtained for fresh and sintered catalyst have a real physical significance. On the other hand, we do not believe that the results obtained on the reactivated catalysts should be taken to indicate a decreased Pt particle size.
Considerations of energetics would rule out the possibility of a plaiiiium particle o f over 200 A. dissociating into 20 A. particles as might be indicated for the cogelled catalyst con- taining 0,30y0 Pt.
Instead, we interpret the apparent decrease in size after reactivation as due to a disruption of the platinum lattice by oxygen atoms. These are removed by subsequent hydro- gen dosing, leaving fissures in the sintered particle.
These fissures are then responsible for an increase in Pt surface area which accounts for increased Hz sorption. At the same time, the degree of ordering in the lattice is reduced and this accounts for the line broadening results.
If we assume that the state of sub-division of the Pt controls the H/Pt ratio, then within each group of catalysts, this does not vary much with the concentration o f Pt. The number o f cc. (STP) per gram of Pt present goes from 41.6 to 45.0 in going from 0.30 to 0.58% cogelled catalyst. For impregnated catalysts the numbers are 82.0 for
O.lO%, 82.6for0.30%, and94.7for0.8076.
Effect of Coking.-It can be seen that the coke deposited on a catalyst during reforming diminishes the hydrogen adsorption sharply, but that sub- sequent regeneration restores it almost to the value o f the fresh catalysts in most cases. This indicates that the coke is concentrated on the surface of the platinum, since the carbon present is as lorn as
0.9% which is only enough to cover at most 570
of the total surface area of the catalyst in mono- layer form. It is surprising, perhaps, that a sample coked for five days, with 2.5% carbon on it,has a slightly higher adsorption than the one day sample with only 0.9%. It may be that the carbon is at first finely divided but then forms aggregates which allow greater diffusion o f Hz.
Despite the low H z adsorption displayed by coked catalysts, it is well-known that one, and even five, days of coke lay-down are not sufficient to deactivate the total activity of such catalysts.

Further, we believe that one of the functions of the high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere in a re- forming reactor is to maintain that steady- state level of sites by continuous hydrogenation of coke-precursor fragments.
It is noteworthy that two samples of regenerated cogelled catalyst, after 1-day coking, displayed two distinct levels (Table I) o f
H
z adsorption despite the fact that the samples were essentially replicates, and other replicates were much more reproducible. We feel that this may be due to the fact that slight differences in local temperatures during regeneration can lead to different levels of sintering in cogelled catalyst.
It is interesting to speculate further about the meaning of the adsorption data on mildly sintered and on regenerated samples in terms of particle growth. One can estimate the number of particles that participate in such a phenomenon and thus arrive at a qualitative description o f the distribu- tion of the platinum on the catalyst surface.
Figure 4 shows the relationship between platinum particle dimension and the number of atoms per particle as derived from the equations discussed previously. From this plot, we were able to calcu- late the average number of Pt atoms per particle for various catalysts as shown in Table IV.

We have suggested earlier that the methods of preparation used for the cogelled and impregnated catalysts could lead, respectively, to aggregated and monolayer types of platinum arrays. X further difference may be in the manner in which the particles are distributed on the catalyst surface.
Cogellation will, most likely, produce widely separated surface localities in which the platinum spheroids, precipitated from chloroplatinic acid solution, will cluster. The bulk of the catalyst surface area is, after all, produced after the plat- inum particles are lodged in the alumina matrix.
By contrast, impregnation o f alumina n-ith chloro- platinic acid should lead to a random distributioii of platinum (rugs.These arrangements serve to explain how n moderate amount of energy, as supplied by careful regeneration or mild steaming will produce a larger degree of polymerization in the cogelled catalyst.Given the thermal energy produced during a regeneration, cogelled catalyst sinters slightly and impregnated catalyst not at all. Mild steaming allows the Pt clusters in cogelled catalyst to coalesce completely; in the impregnated catalyst only a portion of the particles are sintered by this treatment, while the balance remain apparently unaffected.Severe steaming causes complete sintering in both types of catalyst.
