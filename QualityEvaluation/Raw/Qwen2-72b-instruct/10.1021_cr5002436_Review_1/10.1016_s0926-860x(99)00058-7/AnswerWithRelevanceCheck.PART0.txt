          The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, while catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can offer advantages in terms of activity and stability in dehydrogenation processes. The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

          文献没有直接比较诸如铂之类的贵金属基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。但是，它确实专注于研究向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓的效果，表明随着镓含量的增加，丙烯的选择性提高，催化剂失活和碳形成减少。研究指出，镓对催化剂的酸性功能影响较小，但改变了金属相的结构，从而在丙烷脱氢中提高了催化剂的性能。这表明，与纯Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比，镓改性的铂催化剂在脱氢反应中可能更有效且更稳定。通过各种表征技术和催化测试，这些催化剂的有效性得到了证明，表明它们在生产轻烯烃的工业应用中具有潜在优势。这表明，当金属氧化物基催化剂与贵金属结合时，在脱氢过程中可以提供活性和稳定性方面的优势。研究指出，镓对载体的酸性功能影响较小，但在高温还原后，它会改变金属相的结构，导致对铂位点的阻塞和稀释效应。这表明，当金属氧化物基催化剂与贵金属结合时，可以提高脱氢过程中催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
