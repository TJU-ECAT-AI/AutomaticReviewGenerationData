1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, indicating that gallium can enhance the selectivity to propylene, decrease catalyst deactivation, and reduce carbon formation. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can offer advantages in terms of activity and stability in dehydrogenation processes.

1.文献没有直接比较以铂为代表的贵金属基催化剂和如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实关注了在丙烷脱氢中向Pt/Al2O3催化剂添加镓的效果，表明镓可以提高对丙烯的选择性，减少催化剂失活，并降低碳形成。这表明，当金属氧化物基催化剂与贵金属结合时，在脱氢过程中可以提供活性和稳定性方面的优势。
