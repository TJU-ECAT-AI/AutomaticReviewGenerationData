1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts on the performance in propane dehydrogenation, indicating enhanced selectivity to propylene and decreased catalyst deactivation and carbon formation with increased gallium content. The study suggests that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the support but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction, leading to blocking and dilution effects on platinum sites.

1.文献没有直接比较诸如铂之类的贵金属基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。但是，它确实专注于研究在丙烷脱氢反应中，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓对性能的影响，表明随着镓含量的增加，选择性向丙烯提高，催化剂失活和碳形成减少。研究指出，镓对载体的酸性功能影响较小，但在高温还原后，它会改变金属相的结构，导致对铂位点的阻塞和稀释效应。
