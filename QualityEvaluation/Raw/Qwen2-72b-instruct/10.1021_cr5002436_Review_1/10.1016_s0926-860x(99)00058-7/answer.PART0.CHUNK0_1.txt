1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, showing that gallium enhances the selectivity to propylene, decreases catalyst deactivation, and reduces carbon formation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The study highlights the importance of gallium in modifying the structure of the metallic phase of the catalyst, which can lead to improved performance in dehydrogenation processes. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins.

1.文献没有直接比较诸如铂之类的贵金属基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在非氧化脱氢制轻烯烃中的应用。但是，它确实专注于研究在丙烷脱氢中添加镓对Pt/Al2O3催化剂的影响，表明镓增强了对丙烯的选择性，减少了催化剂的失活，并降低了碳的形成。这表明，与纯Pt/Al2O3催化剂相比，镓改性的铂催化剂在脱氢反应中可能更有效且更稳定。该研究强调了镓在修改催化剂金属相结构中的重要性，这可能导致脱氢过程性能的提升。通过各种表征技术和催化测试，这些催化剂的有效性得到了证明，表明它们在生产轻烯烃的工业应用中具有潜在优势。
