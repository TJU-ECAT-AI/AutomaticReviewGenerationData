1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, and the catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, particularly after high-temperature reduction. This suggests that metal oxide-based catalysts, when combined with noble metals, can improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst in dehydrogenation processes.

1.文献没有直接比较诸如铂之类的贵金属基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。但是，它确实专注于研究向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓的效果，表明随着镓含量的增加，丙烯的选择性提高，催化剂失活和碳形成减少。研究指出，镓对催化剂的酸性功能影响较小，但在高温还原后会改变金属相的结构。这表明，当金属氧化物基催化剂与贵金属结合时，可以提高脱氢过程中催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
