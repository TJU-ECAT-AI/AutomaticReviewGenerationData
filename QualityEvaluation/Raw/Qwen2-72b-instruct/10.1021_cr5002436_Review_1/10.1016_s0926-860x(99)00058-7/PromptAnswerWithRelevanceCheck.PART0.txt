1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that the selectivity to propylene is enhanced, while catalyst deactivation and carbon formation are decreased with increasing Ga content. The study indicates that gallium has a low effect on the acidity function of the catalyst but modifies the structure of the metallic phase, leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有直接比较诸如铂之类的贵金属基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。但是，它确实专注于研究向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓的效果，表明随着镓含量的增加，丙烯的选择性提高，而催化剂的失活和碳形成减少。研究指出，镓对催化剂的酸性功能影响较小，但改变了金属相的结构，从而在丙烷脱氢中提高了催化剂的性能。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, such as Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, in the context of the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does focus on the effect of gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, showing that gallium enhances the selectivity to propylene, decreases catalyst deactivation, and reduces carbon formation. This suggests that gallium-modified platinum catalysts can be more effective and stable for dehydrogenation reactions compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The study highlights the importance of gallium in modifying the structure of the metallic phase of the catalyst, which can lead to improved performance in dehydrogenation processes. The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated through various characterization techniques and catalytic tests, indicating their potential advantages in industrial applications for the production of light olefins.
