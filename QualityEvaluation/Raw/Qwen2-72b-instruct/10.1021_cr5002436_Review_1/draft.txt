1. Comparative analysis of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: composition, effectiveness, and industrial applications

Comparative analysis of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins reveals that Pt-based catalysts excel due to their unique bond activation properties, leading to commercial use, notably in the Pacol process (1968) and UOP's Oleflex for butadiene and propylene production \[10.1021/cr5002436_1\]. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly CrOx, have industrial applications and show promise, with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides also demonstrating success \[10.1021/cr5002436_1\]. A novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst demonstrates high activity and selectivity for ethene and propene formation from ethane and propane, respectively, in nonoxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. Its enhanced performance is attributed to PtGa alloys, which inhibit product alkene adsorption and suppress undesired products like methane. Ga addition also reduces coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Optimizing the Ga/Pt ratio achieves peak activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016\]. In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, gallium-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalysts show enhanced selectivity to propylene, reduced deactivation, and decreased carbon formation compared to pure Pt/Al2O3 \[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00058-7\]. Gallium's effect is minimal on the acidity function but modifies the metallic phase structure, improving performance in propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00058-7\]. A novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst demonstrates high effectiveness for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, achieving maximum activity at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, with nearly 100% selectivity to alkene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\]. The alloying of Pt with In reduces coke deposition, enhancing stability and selectivity, making it a promising candidate for industrial light olefin production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that combine the advantages of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, aiming for higher efficiency, stability, and selectivity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The optimization of the Ga/Pt and In/Pt ratios in Pt-based catalysts for peak activity and selectivity suggests a promising direction for catalyst design. Moreover, the investigation of the role of trace sulfur in suppressing hydrogenolysis and coke formation could lead to the development of sulfur-tolerant catalysts for enhanced stability and performance. The exploration of new metal oxide compositions and the integration of noble metals with metal oxides could also open new avenues for improving the activity and stability of catalysts under high-temperature conditions.
