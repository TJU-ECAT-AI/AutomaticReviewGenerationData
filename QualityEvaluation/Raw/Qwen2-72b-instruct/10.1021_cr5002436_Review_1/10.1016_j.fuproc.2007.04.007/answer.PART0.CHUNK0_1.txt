1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it can be mentioned that noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are known for their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. They are often used in the petrochemical industry for the production of olefins from alkanes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. These metal oxides can offer advantages such as lower cost, higher stability, and resistance to poisoning compared to noble metal catalysts. Recent developments in metal oxide catalysts have focused on improving their activity and selectivity through the use of mixed oxides, doping, and nanostructuring. The choice between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts often depends on factors such as the specific reaction conditions, the desired product, and the economics of the process.

1.在提供的文献中没有找到相关的引用来比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。然而,可以提到基于贵金属的催化剂,如铂,因其在脱氢反应中的高活性和选择性而闻名。它们通常用于石化工业中从烷烃生产烯烃。金属氧化物基催化剂,如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物,也因其在脱氢反应中的催化性能而被研究。这些金属氧化物可以提供与贵金属催化剂相比的优势,如成本更低、稳定性更高和抗中毒能力更强。金属氧化物催化剂的最新发展集中在通过使用混合氧化物、掺杂和纳米结构来提高其活性和选择性。选择贵金属或金属氧化物催化剂通常取决于特定反应条件、所需产品和过程的经济性等因素。
