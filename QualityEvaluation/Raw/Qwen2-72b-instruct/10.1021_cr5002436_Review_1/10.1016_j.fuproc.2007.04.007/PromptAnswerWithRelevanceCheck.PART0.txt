1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it can be mentioned that noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are known for their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. They are often used in the petrochemical industry for the production of olefins from alkanes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. These metal oxides can offer advantages such as lower cost, higher stability, and resistance to poisoning compared to noble metal catalysts. Recent developments in metal oxide catalysts have focused on improving their activity and selectivity through the use of mixed oxides, doping, and nanostructuring. The choice between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts often depends on factors such as the specific reaction conditions, the desired product, and the economics of the process.

However, it is known that noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are often used for their high activity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions. They are effective in converting light alkanes to olefins under mild conditions and are widely used in industrial processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also used for dehydrogenation reactions. They offer advantages such as lower cost, higher selectivity, and resistance to poisoning. Recent developments in metal oxide catalysts have focused on improving their activity and stability through the use of mixed oxides and the incorporation of promoters. Noble metal catalysts are typically more expensive but offer higher activity, while metal oxide catalysts are more cost-effective but may require higher temperatures for activation.
