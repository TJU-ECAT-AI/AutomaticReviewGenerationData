1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it is known that noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are widely used due to their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. They are effective in converting light alkanes to olefins under mild conditions and are commonly used in industrial processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also been studied for their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts often offer lower cost and higher stability compared to noble metal-based catalysts. Recent developments in metal oxide catalysts have focused on improving their activity and selectivity through the use of mixed oxides and the addition of promoters. The potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts include their lower cost, higher thermal stability, and resistance to poisoning. Noble metal-based catalysts, on the other hand, offer higher activity and selectivity, making them more suitable for industrial applications where high conversion rates and product purity are required.

1.在文献中没有找到相关的引用，以比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。然而，众所周知，基于贵金属的催化剂，如铂，由于其在脱氢反应中的高活性和选择性而被广泛使用。它们在温和条件下有效地将轻烷烃转化为烯烃，并且通常用于工业过程。基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也因其在脱氢反应中的催化性能而被研究。这些催化剂通常提供较低的成本和较高的稳定性，与基于贵金属的催化剂相比。金属氧化物催化剂的最新发展集中在通过使用混合氧化物和添加促进剂来提高其活性和选择性。基于金属氧化物的催化剂的潜在优势包括成本较低、热稳定性较高和抗中毒能力。另一方面，基于贵金属的催化剂提供更高的活性和选择性，使它们更适合工业应用，其中需要高转化率和产品纯度。
