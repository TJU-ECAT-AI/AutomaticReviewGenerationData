1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it is known that noble metal-based catalysts, such as platinum, are often used for their high activity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions. They are effective in converting light alkanes to olefins under mild conditions and are widely used in industrial processes. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are also used for dehydrogenation reactions. They offer advantages such as lower cost, higher selectivity, and resistance to poisoning. Recent developments in metal oxide catalysts have focused on improving their activity and stability through the use of mixed oxides and the incorporation of promoters. Noble metal catalysts are typically more expensive but offer higher activity, while metal oxide catalysts are more cost-effective but may require higher temperatures for activation.

1.在提供的文献中没有找到相关的引用来比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。然而，众所周知，基于贵金属的催化剂，如铂，因其在脱氢反应中的高活性和稳定性而被广泛使用。它们在温和条件下有效地将轻烷烃转化为烯烃，并广泛应用于工业过程。基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也用于脱氢反应。它们提供了成本更低、选择性更高和抗中毒性更强的优点。最近在金属氧化物催化剂方面的发展集中在通过使用混合氧化物和添加促进剂来提高其活性和稳定性。贵金属催化剂通常成本更高，但活性更高，而金属氧化物催化剂成本效益更高，但可能需要更高的温度来激活。
