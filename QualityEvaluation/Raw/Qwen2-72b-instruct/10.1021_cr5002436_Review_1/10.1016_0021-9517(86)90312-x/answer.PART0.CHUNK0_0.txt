1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spine1 in the dehydrogenation of lower paraffins, particularly propane, isobutane, and isopentane. The catalyst was shown to be efficient for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation, with trace amounts of sulfur in the feed suppressing hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Platinum on alumina was found to be more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments. The results are discussed in terms of metal-support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了铂支持在镁铝酸镁脊髓1上的脱氢效率，特别是在丙烷，异丁烷和异戊烷的脱氢中。该催化剂被证明在高温，长周期脱氢中有效，饲料中硫的痕量抑制了氢化和焦炭形成。发现铂在氧化环境中的铝酸盐上更容易发生金属烧结。结果以金属-支持相互作用及其扰动的术语讨论了硫化合物。
