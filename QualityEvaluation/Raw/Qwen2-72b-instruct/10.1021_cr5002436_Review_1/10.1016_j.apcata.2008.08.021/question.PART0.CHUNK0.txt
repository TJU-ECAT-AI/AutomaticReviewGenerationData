1. Introduction
The discovery of the M41S family materials has attracted much attention in a wide range of research fields [15]. The increased interest is based on the presence of a well-defined ordered mesoporous structure which provides to the material with excellent textural properties together with the absence of diffusional restrictions, typically present on microporous materi- als. Among them, MCM-41 is probably the most widely investi- gated. Unfortunately, pure siliceous MCM-41 materials exhibit poor acidity and redox properties which limit their application in research fields such as catalysis. This inconvenience has been overcome by incorporating metal species into the silica matrix.
Although the incorporation of the metal cation into the structure of the mesoporous molecular sieve commonly produces the partial deterioration of the long-range ordered structure, the newly created active centres have shown an improved catalytic behaviour for a wide range of organic reactions [610]. In this sense, Tanev et al. described an excellent activity and selectivity for Ti-containing mesoporous molecular sieves in the oxidation of phenols to quinones and the conversion of benzene to phenol [6].
In the same way, Corma et al. reported an improved catalytic activity and selectivity of Sn modified MCM-41 materials for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones to lactones [7]. The improved behaviour was attributed to the strong polarizing ability of the newly created Lewis acid centres incorporated into the structure of the MCM-41.
Interestingly, in the last few years the incorporation of metal cations to the siliceous framework of MCM-41 has been extended to other metal species such Al [8,10,11], V [12], Zr [13], Cu [9,14], Zn [11,15,16], etc., and even to bimetallic mixtures such as AlZn [8,10,17], AlFe [8], CuZn [9,14], etc. The huge development of new materials has spread their possibilities on a wide range of organic reactions (oxidation, alkylation,hydroxylation,etc.).
Although the metal incorporation improves the catalytic proper- ties of the pure MCM-41 material, the real location of the metal species is quite frequently a matter of debate.
Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol. The promoting effect of the more electro- positive metal has been attributed to the formation of bimetallic PtM and/or PtMOx entities which favour the adsorption trough Applied Catalysis A: General 351 (2008) 1623

The effect of Zn location and reduction temperature have been studied on pure and Zn-modified MCM-41 supported Pt catalysts. Experimental results show that incorporation of Zn into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41 material introduces structural oxidized Zn centres with a high stability towards a reduction treatment even at high temperatures. XP spectra confirm the high stability of these Zn species although, at the highest reduction temperature (723 K), a high mobility of the doping cations from structural positions to the inner wall of the mesopores is observed. Catalytic studies in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde show that the presence of Zn produces an important decrease in the catalytic activity of the Pt nanoparticles, in accordance with Pt dispersion measurements.
However, the presence of Zn improves the selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol. Compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, structural Zn centres in the doped Pt/ZnMCM- 41 catalysts exhibit a higher polarizing/activation of the carbonyl double bond giving rise to a higher yield to crotyl alcohol, the product of interest. Additionally, these Zn-modified MCM-41-based Pt catalysts show an excellent behaviour in an important industrial reaction such as the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity of 100%, which remains stable with time on stream. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The preferential adsorption through the carbonyl double bond compared to the nearby C C in the bimetallic systems has been confirmed using

calculations [22].
Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above,the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime.
Taking into account the beneficial effects of zinc and the improved catalytic behaviour of the metal-doped ordered mesopor- ous materials, the aim of this work is to study the effect of Zn on the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts supported on pure and Zn- modified MCM-41. More specifically, the effect of Zn on the catalytic behaviour of Pt nanoparticles will be studied either when Zn is incorporated into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41 or just deposited on the surface using conventional impregnation methods.
The catalytic behaviour of these materials will be compared in two important reaction processes such as the chemoselective hydro- genation of an a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, e.g. crotonaldehyde, and the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene.
2. Experimental
The preparation and characterization of pure siliceous and Zn- modified MCM-41 spheres with two different metal contents (Zn(A)MCM-41,2 wt.% Zn, Zn/Si atomic ratio = 0.02;and Zn(B)MCM-41, 4 wt.% Zn, Zn/Si atomic ratio = 0.04) was described elsewhere [16]. All samples exhibit a well-defined morphology (spheres) with the long-range order being partly deteriorated for higher Zn contents (Zn/Si ratio 0.04). Pt/MCM-41, Pt/Zn(A)MCM- 41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by wet impreg- nation of the original supports using an aqueous solution of [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2, with the appropriate concentration to achieve 1 wt.% Pt. The effect of Zn location on the catalytic behaviour was checked by preparing a conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst by wet co-impregnation of the pure siliceous MCM-41 with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)26H2O and [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2,in order to achieve a metal loading of 1 wt.% Pt and 2 wt.% Zn. After the impregnation, all catalysts were dried overnight at 373 K and subsequently calcined in air for 4 h at 673 K.
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor under a 5% H2/He gas flow of 50 ml min1 and about 200 mg of sample. Hydrogen consumption was followed by on-line mass spectrometry (Balzers QMS 200).
The number of Pt surface atoms on the catalysts was determined by hydrogen chemisorption at 298 K in a glass-made volumetric equipment. Hydrogen uptakes were used to determine the metal dispersion, H/Pt, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the chemisorption process.
Differential heats of H2 adsorption were measured at 298 K in a Setaram BT2.15D heat-flux calorimeter. The equipment was connected to a high vacuum (base pressure <105 Torr) mano- metric system employing Baratron capacitance manometers for high precision pressure readings (0.5  104 Torr). The maximum apparent leak rate of the system (including the calorimetric cells) was 105 Torr min1 in a volume of approximately 80 cm3 (i.e. 105 mmol min1). In a common microcalorimetric experiment,about 250 mg of catalyst were treated ex situ in ultrapure hydrogen (99.999%, Air Liquide) for 2 h at 723 K (heating rate 2 K min1, flow:100 ml min1) and then purged for 1 h at the same temperature using ultrahigh purity helium (99.999%, Air Liquide, flow: 100 ml min1) for removing adsorbed hydrogen. Both gases were further purified using a copper turning trap at 473 K and a 13X molecular sieve trap working at 77 K for the removal of oxygen and water traces, respectively. The treated sample was sealed in a Pyrex NMR tube capsule and broken in a special calorimetric cell [25], once thermal equilibrium with the calorimeter was achieved. Microcalorimetric data were collected by sequential introduction of small gas doses (110 mmol) of H2 (99.999%, with further purification, Air Liquide) until complete saturation of the sample. The resulting heat response for each dose was recorded as a function of time and integrated to quantify the total amount of energy released (mJ). The amount of gas adsorbed (mmol) was determined manometrically from the dose, equilibrium pres- sures, and the system volumes and temperatures. The time required for the pressure to reach the equilibrium in the calorimeter after each dose was approximately 115 min. The differential heat (kJ mol1),defined as the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of gas adsorbed, was then calculated for each dose as the ratio between the heat released and the amount adsorbed.The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts both fresh and reduced at 523 and 723 K was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XP spectra were acquired with a VG- Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemi- spherical electron analyser and a Mg Ka (hn = 1253.6 eV,1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder samples were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and reduced in flowing H2 at the desired temperature, before being transferred to the analysis chamber. Before recording the spectra, the sample was maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure of ca. 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after subtraction of the S-shaped back- ground, and by fitting the experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%) and Gaussian (70%) lines. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV, which provided binding energy values with an accuracy of 0.2 eV.Catalytic measurements in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde were performed at atmospheric pressure using a dynamic glass micro-flow reactor equipped with on-line gas chromatography. Before any experiment, the catalyst (100 mg) was reduced in flowing
H2
(50 ml min1) at the desired temperature (523 and 723 K) for 2 h, with a heating rate of 2 K min1, and then cooled under hydrogen down to the reaction temperature (353 K). The reaction mixture (H2/crotonaldehyde ratio of 26) was prepared by passing a hydrogen flow (50 ml min1) through a thermostabilized saturator
(293 K)
containing the crotonaldehyde. A Carbowax 20M 58/90 2530 m semi-capillary column was used to separate the reaction products.
Dehydrogenation of iso-butane (iC4) was conducted using a stainless-steel apparatus and a glass continuous-flow reactor. In each experiment, around 200 mg of catalyst were reduced in situ in a hydrogen stream (50 ml min1) at 723 K for 2 h (heating rate 2 K min1). Iso-butane reactivity was measured at 723 K using
0.016 atm of iso-butane, 0.098 atm of hydrogen and He up to 1 atm.
The reactor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed using a Varian Star 3400 Cx gas-chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a 50 m HP-Al/S column (J&W Scientific).
3. Results and discussion
The chemical composition of the different catalysts was determined by atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AAS) for Pt and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) for Zn. As it can be inferred from Table 1, whereas the percentage of Zn is quite similar to the nominal value (shown in brackets) in all catalysts, the amount of Pt increases with Zn content. Apparently, the presence of Zn either into the silica framework or supported on the silica surface favours

17 the interaction with the Pt precursor, thus favouring its anchoring to the surface. This can be clearly understood for the Zn-modified MCM-41 samples, i.e. Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41,where the presence of some surface negative charge (Brnsted acidity) coming from the substitution of Si4+ by Zn2+ will favour the interaction of the cation precursor [Pt(NH3)4]2+ with the modified silica surface.
3.1. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
Fig. 1 shows the H2 consumption profiles as a function of temperature for the four catalysts studied. As it can be observed,hydrogen consumption in the temperature range applied is nearly nil for the monometallic Pt/MCM-41 as well as for the Pt/ZnMCM- 41 catalysts, i.e. Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41. The lack of reduction processes on the Pt/MCM-41 catalyst could be attributed either to the absence oxidized platinum species, due to the previous calcination treatment, or most likely to the low platinum content on this sample (0.5 wt.%). Concerning the Pt/ ZnMCM-41 samples, it is again remarkable the absence of reduction processes associated with Pt and more especially with Zn species, taking into account that these samples have a noticeable Zn loading (2 and 4 wt.%). This behaviour is somehow different to that reported for Cu-doped MCM-41 materials in which the reduction of Cu was observed at low temperatures [9,14]. The reduction process observed was attributed to the complete accessibility of H2 to the copper species located into the siliceous framework. However, the incorporation of Zn to these Cu- MCM-41 materials (CuZn-MCM-41) was able to inhibit the reduction of Cu2+ at low temperatures even though the well- known synergetic effects exerted by ZnO on the reduction of copper on un-supported CuOZnO catalysts [26]. Concerning the reduction of Pt, a shift to higher temperatures was described for Pt catalysts supported on zeolites upon addition of Zn [23,27].
Consequently, the absence of reduction processes in the Pt/ ZnMCM-41 catalysts reflects on one hand the high stability of the Zn2+ species located into the siliceous framework and, on the other hand, the possible partial inhibition of Pt reduction in the presence of Zn.
Temperature-programmed reduction profile corresponding to the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 (Fig. 1d) catalyst exhibits important differences. In this sample, two broad hydrogen consumption peaks, centred at 507 and 1050 K, can be clearly discerned.
According to the literature, the peak at low temperature (507 K) must be attributed to the reduction of PtOx to Pt, the reduction process being slightly inhibited in the presence of Zn (the reduction appears at around 353373 K on monometallic Pt/ MCM-41 catalysts) [28]. On the other hand, the high temperature reduction peak corresponds to the reduction of ZnO to Zn, a reduction process that could be promoted trough hydrogen spillover from nearby Pt nanoparticles [23].
3.2. H2 chemisorption at 298 K
The hydrogen chemisorption results for the four catalysts under study both after a reduction treatment at low (523 K) and high (723 K) temperature are shown in Table 1. These results were obtained from the irreversible adsorbed hydrogen at 298 K and considering that one hydrogen atom chemisorbs on one platinum surface atom. As it can be observed, the amount of hydrogen irreversible adsorbed (H/Pt) exhibits a maximum for the mono- metallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst after a reduction treatment at low temperature, suggesting a fairly high Pt dispersion (93%). The large platinum dispersion obtained is in accordance with the high surface area of MCM-41 materials [29]. An increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K on the monometallic Pt/MCM- 41 catalyst produces a slight decrease in the dispersion value down to 81%, thus suggesting the partial sintering of the platinum nanoparticles upon the reduction treatment. Interestingly, the incorporation of Zn into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41 produces a sudden decrease in the hydrogen chemisorption ability of the Pt nanoparticles, with dispersion values around 10% even after a low temperature reduction treatment. XRD and XPS (shown below) measurements ruled out any drastic sintering of the Pt particles in the presence of Zn. Thus, either electronic and/or geometric effects of the surrounding Zn species must account for the observed behaviour. However, considering that Zn species must be still located into the siliceous framework, at least after a low temperature reduction treatment, the sudden decrease in the Pt dispersion in the presence of Zn should be restricted to the income of electronic interactions between Pt and Zn. A similar income of electronic effects (suppression in the hydrogenation Table 1 Catalysts composition, chemisorption results and TOF values.

18 ability) on Pt nanoparticles was described for Pt/CeO2/SiO2 catalysts upon Zn addition, again after a low temperature reduction treatment (473 K) [19]. The strong interaction observed between Pt and Zn in the Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts suggests that the nucleation and growth of the Pt nanoparticles must take place in the vicinity of the structural Zn centres.
Bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits also a drastic inhibition in the hydrogen chemisorption ability, both after a low and high temperature reduction treatment. However, this effect is one order of magnitude higher than that observed on the doped Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, with the same metal content (2 wt.% Zn). Thus, this result suggest either a higher degree of interaction between platinum and zinc or, most likely, the presence of additional structural effects, i.e. platinum dilution due to Zn migration and/or PtZn alloy formation [30,31].
3.3. H2 adsorption microcalorimetry
Fig. 2 shows the differential heat versus coverage for H2 adsorption at room temperature on Pt/MCM-41 and Pt/ Zn(A)MCM-41 catalysts after a reduction treatment at high temperature (723 K). Samples Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 and PtZn/MCM- 41 are not included due to their low H2 chemisorption capacity which prevents any accurate measurement of the differential heat evolved. As it can be observed, an increase in the H2 coverage produces a decrease in the differential heat of adsorption for both samples. This behaviour is attributed to the adsorption of hydrogen on weaker sites and/or to the presence of additional interactions between adsorbed molecules. At high hydrogen coverage, there is in both cases a sudden decrease in the differential heat (below 40 kJ mol1), thus suggesting the saturation of the accessible platinum surface sites (the physisorption level is achieved).
Monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows an initial heat of adsorption of 80 kJ mol1, which is in close agreement with the value of 90  5 kJ mol1 reported in the literature for hydrogen adsorption on silica and non-acidic zeolite-supported platinum catalysts [3234]. The hydrogen saturation uptake on this catalyst is 7 mmol g1. It is noteworthy to mention that both the initial heat and the saturation coverage are strongly affected upon incorporation of Zn into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41. In fact, the initial heat of adsorption decreases from 80 kJ mol1 on Pt/MCM-41 to 53 kJ mol1 on the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst, this value being even lower than that reported for a bimetallic PtZn/X-zeolite catalyst (75 kJ mol1), although with a lower zinc content (0.23 wt.%) [22]. A similar decrease (824 kJ mol1) in the adsorption energy was described for CO on Pt(1 1 1) single crystals upon addition of Zn [30].
As it can be observed, the decrease in the initial heat of adsorption in the presence of Zn is also accompanied by a strong decrease in the hydrogen saturation coverage down to a value of 1.5 mmol g1, in good agreement with H2 chemisorption data.
In summary, these results confirm that incorporation of Zn into the siliceous matrix of MCM-41 drastically modifies the physico- chemical properties of the supported Pt nanoparticles, i.e. there is a weakening both in the strength and extent of their interaction with
H2. This is a clear indication of the strong interaction established
between both metal species after a high temperature reduction treatment (723 K). Previous studies described in the literature have shown that, when added to platinum, zinc can act both as a ligand (electronic effects) and/or as a dilutant (geometric effects) [19,22,30]. The presence of electronic effects on Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts should prevail after low temperature reduction treat- ments (473 K), as observed in the chemisorption results. However,after a high temperature reduction treatment
(723 K)
the additional presence of geometric effects, i.e. Pt dilution by Zn and/or PtZn alloy formation, cannot be ruled out. In fact, the possible formation of PtZn alloy phases has been addressed by several authors after a reduction treatment at temperatures above 400473 K [30,31]. The presence of geometric effects after a reduction at 723 K would imply the migration of Zn from structural positions to the outer surface of the mesoporous channels. In this sense, XPS results (shown below) confirm the presence of migration processes for Zn after a high temperature reduction treatment (723 K).
3.4. X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy
The surface composition of the four studied catalysts both calcined (un-reduced) and in situ reduced at 523 and 723 K, as well as the binding energies corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level are reported in Table 2. In all cases, two values are given for the Pt 4f7/2 binding energy which corresponds to the deconvolution of the main band in two components. Interestingly, while fresh (un- reduced) monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst already exhibits more than 46% of reduced platinum (Pt), Zn-containing samples only exhibit Pt 4f7/2 binding energies above 72.0 eV, which corresponds to oxidized platinum species. The presence of Pt0 on the fresh catalyst must be attributed to the previous calcination treatment,the reduction from PtOx to Pt being partially inhibited in the Fig. 2. Differential heat of H2 adsorption at 298 K versus coverage on Pt/MCM-41 catalyst (full squares) and Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 catalyst (empty circles), after a reduction treatment at 723 K.

19 presence of Zn. A subsequent reduction treatment at low temperature (523 K) produces in all Zn-containing catalysts the onset of a new component at a lower binding energy (71.0
71.6 eV), which can be unambiguously assigned to metallic
platinum. After the low temperature reduction treatment, the proportion of reduced Pt is quite similar for all samples independently of the presence or absence of Zn (74%). Only the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 exhibits a lower percentage probably due to the larger PtZn interaction on this sample. A further increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K hardly modifies the Pt 4f7/2 binding energy. In fact, the reduction treatment at high temperature only affects the relative amount of reduced platinum with a final percentage around 80% for all catalysts. Only the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 exhibits an additional shift in the Pt 4f7/2 binding energy to lower values (0.4 eV).
The Pt/Si XPS atomic ratio, which can be considered a measure of the platinum dispersion, is also reported in Table 2. In all cases,the Pt/Si ratio scarcely decreases with the reduction temperature,thus suggesting the absence of appreciable Pt sintering after the different reduction treatments. Contrary to the chemisorption results, the Pt/Si ratio slightly increases on the Zn-modified MCM- 41 samples, this effect being more evident on sample Pt/ Zn(B)MCM-41. Apparently, the presence of Zn on the structure of
MCM-41
enhances Pt dispersion,the strong interaction established between these finely divided Pt nanoparticles and the support (Zn-MCM-41) being the reason for their reduced reducibility at low temperatures. The increased metal dispersion in the presence of Zn is in accordance with previous studies on CuZnMCM-41 materials and strongly supports the hypothesis of the electronic effects as responsible for the decreased chemisorp- tion ability of Pt nanoparticles after a low temperature reduction treatment [9]. Only the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a remarkable low Pt/Si ratio, in agreement with H2 chemisorption measurements.
Another important parameter to consider is the Si/Zn atomic ratio deduced from XPS. In the same way as the Pt/Si ratio, there are two different behaviours depending on the nature of the support.
On Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts, whereas the reduction treatment at low temperature (523 K) produce only a slight decrease in the Si/ Zn ratio, a huge increase is observed after a reduction treatment at high temperature (723 K). The increased Si/Zn ratio suggests a high mobility of the structural Zn species after a high temperature reduction treatment, most probably from structural positions to the inner surface of the mesoporous channels (where XPS cannot reach them). This behaviour differs considerably from that exhibited by the bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, where a continuous increase in the Si/Zn atomic ratio with the reduction temperature is observed. In summary, XPS results show that upon a reduction treatment at low temperature (523 K) Zn species incorporated into the silica framework of MCM-41 exhibit a higher stability (lower mobility) compared with the conventional deposited Zn nanoparticles. The situation becomes different after a high temperature reduction treatment (723 K) where a high mobility of Zn species is observed for all catalysts.
The assessment of the oxidation state of Zn from the binding energy of the Zn 2p3/2 level is not very useful due to the close appearance on XPS of the transitions corresponding to Zn(II) and metallic Zn [35]. This drawback can be overcome using the Zn LMM Auger transition, as the Auger shift between Zn(II) and metallic Zn is higher than 4.6 eV [36]. The analysis of the Zn LMM Auger transition for the three Zn-containing catalysts, both after a low and high temperature reduction treatment,show a single contribution centred at a kinetic energy of 986988 eV, this contribution being previously assigned to oxidized Zn (see Fig. 3) [18]. This finding suggests that, even after a reduction treatment at 723 K, Zn is present in all catalysts mainly as oxidized Zn. The high stability of Zn on the Pt/ZnMCM-41 catalysts is in accordance with the absence of reduction processes in the TPR experiments, thus supporting the hypothesis that Zn2+ species are taking part in the siliceous framework of the MCM-41 material. In the case of the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, the presence of some reduced Zn would be expected due to the absence of any additional stabilization from the silica support. Unfortunately, AES measure- ments (Fig. 3c) do not allow discerning any additional contribution from metallic Zn (commonly appearing in the 991995 eV range),in accordance with TPR results.
3.5. Catalytic behaviour
3.5.1. Chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde
The chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde is a very interesting reaction both from an academic and industrial point of view due to the presence of two conjugated double bonds, a C
C
and a C
O. The products formed under the reaction conditions
used in this study are butyraldehyde, which comes from the hydrogenation of the C C double bond; crotyl alcohol, which comes from the hydrogenation of the C O double bond; butanol,which is the completely hydrogenated product produced in a secondary hydrogenation step; and finally light hydrocarbons such as butane and propane coming from further hydrogenation and decarbonilation reactions. For all catalysts and independently of the reduction conditions, butyraldehyde and crotylalcohol were the main products obtained (less than 2% butanol and 2% butane was observed on the monometallic Pt/MCM-41 in the initial stages of the reaction, these compounds being absent in the presence of Zn). Fig. 4a plots the evolution of the overall catalytic activity (mmoles of crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of Pt) as a function of time on stream for the different catalysts after a reduction treatment at 523 K. The monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a much higher activity than the Zn-containing catalysts. In all cases, after a pronounced deactivation during the first 20 min on stream, a steady-state activity value is reached.
Both, initial and steady-state activities, strongly decrease in the presence of Zn (for Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41), this effect being more detrimental upon an increase in the amount of Zn. It is noteworthy to mention that the conventional PtZn/MCM- 41 catalyst exhibits the lowest catalytic activity of all samples.
These results are in agreement with the lower number of accessible platinum sites on the Zn-doped and bimetallic PtZn Fig. 3. AES Zn (LMM) spectra of (a) Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41, (b) Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 and (c) PtZn/MCM-41 catalysts after a reduction treatment at 723 K.

20 catalysts, as deduced from H2 chemisorption measurements (see Table 1). The comparison of the TOF, i.e. number of molecules reacted per Pt surface atom, as determined from H2 chemisorption measurements, gives rise to a completely different picture (Table 1). In the initial stages of the reaction (after 10 min time on stream) the TOF goes from 18 s1, on the monometallic Pt/ MCM-41, to 21 and 14 s1, for the Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/ Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts, respectively. Apparently, incorporation of a small percentage of Zn (2 wt.%) into the silica matrix of MCM-41 slightly improves the catalytic behaviour of the Pt nanoparticles,this effect being detrimental for higher Zn loadings. Interestingly,the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a TOF as high as 57 s1. However, this value is meaningless due to the low uncertainty in the dispersion measurement for this sample. It is noteworthy to mention that on bimetallic PtZn systems the TOF values should be considered carefully because the electronic effects exerted by Zn on Pt not necessarily affects in the same extent two different processes such as the adsorption of hydrogen and the adsorption/hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. An increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K (Fig. 4b) leads to a similar catalytic activity profile, with the monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibiting by far the highest activity (steady-state activity of 550 mmol s1 g Pt1). Concerning the TOF, monometallic Pt/ MCM-41 exhibits a similar value to that reported after a low temperature reduction treatment (17 s1). However, the high temperature reduction treatment becomes detrimental for the Pt/ Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts with TOF values of 11 and 10 s1, respectively.
Fig. 5a and b plots the evolution of selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol (CROALC) versus conversion after the reduc- tion treatments at low (523 K) and high temperature (723 K),respectively. After reduction at 523 K, monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows the lowest selectivity (0.5%), which remains nearly unchanged with time on stream. This low selectivity confirms the high affinity of platinum to hydrogenate the C C double bond,thus leading to the formation of the saturated aldehyde. The incorporation of Zn into the structure of the MCM-41 produces a noticeable increase in selectivity reaching a value as high as 39% (conversion of 23%) for the Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalyst. Interest- ingly, for all Zn-containing catalysts the selectivity towards CROALC formation increases in the first minutes of the reaction (with a decrease in the conversion) up to a maximum, suddenly decreasing thereafter. This behaviour reflects the presence of secondary reactions on these catalysts, namely the hydrogenation of crotyl alcohol to butanol. As the catalysts deactivate and the conversion decreases,the secondary reaction becomes less favoured and thus, selectivity to crotyl alcohol increases. However,the deactivation also affects to the active sites responsible for the hydrogenation of carbonyl double bond to produce crotyl alcohol,thus explaining the maximum observed in selectivity with Fig. 4.

21 conversion. Conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst shows a very similar behaviour, with a maximum selectivity of 37% at a slightly lower conversion (1.2%).
A further increase in the reduction temperature to 723 K produces important changes in all catalysts (Fig. 5b). Mono- metallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a twelve times increase in the selectivity (6%), a behaviour commonly attributed to the better performance of larger Pt nanoparticles [37,38]. The sintering of the nanoparticles results in a surface rearrangement of the platinum exposed faces towards a higher number of (1 1 1) terraces. These close-packed metal surfaces exhibit a lower ability to coordinate the olefinic (C C) double bond and, thus, a higher proportion of these faces in the catalyst surface would improve the selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol forma- tion [39,40]. A further increase in the selectivity to crotyl alcohol is also observed for the Zn-containing catalysts upon a higher temperature reduction treatment, with values as high as 45 and 42% for Pt/Zn(A)MCM-41 and Pt/Zn(B)MCM-41 catalysts, respec- tively. Interestingly and contrary to this behaviour, the reduction treatment at 723 K produces on the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst, together with a decrease in activity, a noticeable drop in the selectivity from 37 to 22%. The higher selectivity found on the bimetallic sample after a low temperature reduction treatment could be attributed to the presence of oxidized Zn species, able to polarize the carbonyl bond of crotonaldehyde,thus favouring its hydrogenation. However, the reduction at 723 K could cause the partial reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn,with possible PtZn alloy formation, which has been invoked to be much less effective as a promoter than PtZn2+ entities [41]. On the Zn-doped MCM-41 catalysts, the higher stability of these oxidized Zn species (as a consequence of taking part into the siliceous structure) would justify the higher selectivity found for these samples,even after a reduction treatment at high temperature.
In summary, catalytic studies on the chemoselective hydro- genation of crotonaldehyde show that monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a high ability towards the hydrogenation of the olefinic double bond (C C) to produce butyraldehyde. However,incorporation of Zn either into the siliceous matrix of the MCM-41 or deposited on the silica surface gives rise to an improved selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol. The polarizing/ activation ability of these Zn species is highly improved when they are incorporated into the siliceous framework of the MCM-41,compared with a conventional PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst. In the conventional catalyst, the possible formation of PtZn alloy phases,after a reduction treatment at high temperature (above 523 K),becomes detrimental for the polarization/activation of the carbonyl double bond.
3.5.2. Dehydrogenation of iso-butane
Fig. 6a reports the iso-butane conversion versus time on stream for the four catalysts under study. These experiments were conducted at high temperature (723 K), 0.016 atm iso- butane pressure, 0.098 atm hydrogen pressure (H2/iC4 = 6), and a WHSV of 4.5 h1. The monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst shows higher conversion values than the bimetallic samples, although with a faster deactivation with time on stream (conversion decreases from 51 to 29% in 24 h). This deactivation was completely suppressed after Zn addition, although at a lower conversion level. While both Pt catalysts supported on Zn-doped MCM-41 show a similar initial iso-butane conversion at around 15%, the conventional bimetallic PtZn/MCM-41 catalyst results in a slightly lower value (12%), in agreement with the lower platinum dispersion on this sample (see Table 1). With regard to selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane) composing the rest of outlet gases. Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment. Again, specific interactions between Pt and Zn can be invoked to explain these good results. It is well known that deactivation and selectivity loss in this kind of processes is due to side reactions such as cracking and isomerization, which produce blocking of active sites by coke deposition. It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site [42] whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensem- bles of surface platinum atoms [43]. Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the presence of ionic species of a second metal close to platinum can favour the migration of highly dehydrogenated species (coke precursors) from the active site to the support [44]. The same arguments can be used for the conventional PtZn/MCM-41 although, in this case, the possible formation of a PtZn alloy could also contribute to the enhanced selectivity and stability.

4. Conclusions
The study reported in this paper shows that the presence of Zn,both taking part of the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface of well-defined MCM-41 spheres improves the selectivity of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonal- dehyde to crotyl alcohol. Interestingly, the incorporation of these Zn species into the silica matrix produces structural centres with a higher stability towards a reduction treatment together with a higher polarizing/activation ability towards molecules containing a carbonyl double bond. In fact, the newly created active sites further improve both the catalytic activity and selectivity (yield) to crotyl alcohol as compared with a conventional impregnated PtZn/ MCM-41 catalyst. These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso- butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream.
