[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[6] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[7] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[8] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
[9] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[10] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
[11] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[12] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[13] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[14] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[15] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[16] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[17] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[18] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[19] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[20] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[21] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[22] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[23] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
[24] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[25] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
[26] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[27] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[28] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[29] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[30] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium."
[31] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[32] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[33] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[34] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."

2.Pt catalysts have high activity for dehydrogenation, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are accelerated at higher temperatures. Noble metal catalysts, when combined with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, allow for the design and operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units that produce light olefins, such as propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures.
3.Pt catalysts are highly active and do not require large quantities to catalyze reactions when dispersed on high surface-area supports. High dispersion is necessary for high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions. Alumina supports, which have acidic sites that accelerate isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, are used with Pt catalysts. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in controlling acidity, and suitable modifiers are used to eliminate acidity.
4.Modified Pt catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, suppressing coke formation and improving stability. Alumina is used as a support material due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and superior capability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is essential for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C.
7.Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions.
