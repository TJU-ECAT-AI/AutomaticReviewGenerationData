[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
[7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
[9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
[14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
[17] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[18] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
[19] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[20] "The reaction pathways involved in heavy paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. detergent-range C10C14 n-paraffins) are more complicated than those in light paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. propane and isobutane)."
[21] "The main difference in reaction pathways is that a significant amount of cyclic compounds can form via dehydrocyclization from heavy paraffins; this is not the case for light paraffins."
[22] "Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate possible reactions that take place on Pt and acid (A) sites, respectively, in the dehydrogenation of light and heavy paraffins when the catalyst is not selective, e.g. unmodified platinum catalysts supported on alumina."
[23] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[24] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifications."
[25] "Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."
[26] "Various by-products, as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6, can also form."
[27] "In addition, the catalyst rapidly deactivates due to fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[28] "Therefore, the properties of platinum and the alumina support need to be modified to suppress the formation of by-products and to increase catalytic stability."
[29] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction."
[30] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[31] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
[32] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[33] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[34] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[35] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[36] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[37] "Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[38] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[39] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[40] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[41] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[42] "Over modified catalysts, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler."
[43] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[44] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[45] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[46] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."
[47] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[48] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[49] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[50] "In paraffin dehydrogenation, the rate of paraffin conversion (x) and mono-olefin production (sx) are given by Eqs. (1) and (2) respectively:dx dt = f1(ki, Kipj) (1) d(sx) dt = f2(ki, Ki, pj) (2) where s is the selectivity to n-mono-olefins, t the contact time, f the rate function, ki the rate constant for reaction step i, Ki the equilibrium constant for reaction step i, and pj is the partial pressure of the j compound."
[51] "The following relationship between selectivity and conversion can be derived from Eqs. (1) and (2):d(sx) dx = f2(ki, Ki, pj) f1(ki, Ki, pj) (3) The ki and Ki are a function of temperature and pj is a function of conversion, total pressure (P), and feed ratio (R)."
[52] "Therefore, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as d(sx) dx = f2[ki(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R] f1[ki(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R] (4) As Eq. (4) is the ratio of two functions, the rate constants become relative values and can be expressed as ki(T)/k0(T), where k0(T) is the rate constant for the forward reaction of paraffin dehydrogenation to mono-olefins."
[53] "Eq. (4) can be written in a functional form in F as follows:d(sx) dx = F ki(T ) k0(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R (5) Eq. (5) indicates that selectivity is a function of conversion for the catalyst used (relative rate constants) and the given reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed ratio)."
[54] "Selectivity decreases as the conversion increases because n-mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products."
[55] "Selectivity decreases sharply as conversion approaches equilibrium because the main dehydrogenation process is limited by equilibrium, but other reactions continue to occur."
[56] "Therefore, if side reactions are controlled, the selectivity is improved as the equilibrium conversion becomes higher by increasing the temperature and by decreasing the pressure and the feed ratio of hydrogen to paraffin."
[57] "The relationship between selectivity and conversion can be simulated according to Eq. (5), if rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants are known."
[58] "Fig. 8 shows simulated selectivities to n-heptene and n-heptadiene for the dehydrogenation of n-heptane."
[59] "In this simulation, the relative rate constants used are unity, which represents that the catalyst possesses perfect selectivity regarding consecutive dehydrogenation; the dehydrogenation rate of paraffin is equal to that of mono-olefin and diolefin."
[60] "Experimental selectivities obtained over a UOP dehydrogenation catalyst show good agreement with the predicted values."
[61] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism."
[62] "The rest of the equations may be derived accordingly."
[63] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[64] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[65] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[66] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[67] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[68] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[69] "Houdrys Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of stepsprocess, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[70] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[71] "UOPs Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[72] "Snamprogettis dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[73] "Here too the coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[74] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[75] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step; because several reactors are used in parallel, an average conversion is obtained."
[76] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[77] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[78] "In Oleflex adiabatic reactors, a significant temperature drop occurs across the catalyst bed which lowers the equilibrium conversion level; a multistage reactor system with interstage reheating is used for higher paraffin conversions."
[79] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single stage reactor system."
[80] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[81] "The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s."
[82] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[83] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[84] "Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[85] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[86] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[87] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[88] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[89] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[90] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[91] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[92] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[93] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the mid-1960s for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, as demonstrated by Haensel in the 1940s. Bloch further developed these catalysts in the 1960s for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability, minimizing cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefin production for detergents, with over 30 commercial units in operation by 1999. Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units are typically operated under mild conditions below 500 C for heavy olefins, but this is not economical for light olefins. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology introduced by UOP in the early 1970s allowed noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years without shutdowns, enabling the design and operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units for light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process, with several commercial units in operation as of late 2000. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts, though selective, has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions that cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are typically employed in the dehydrogenation of butanes to butenes and propane to propylene. Chromia-alumina catalysts have been used since the late 1930s for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, with commercial processes achieving per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes, and 10-20% for C10-C14 paraffins. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10-C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation using these catalysts. The objectives in using metal oxide-based catalysts include approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and conversion efficiency, particularly in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. The use of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes is considered relatively mature and well-established compared to the still developing field of oxydehydrogenation.

1. 自1960年代中期以来，基于贵金属的催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），已被用于催化脱氢，用于生产长链线性烯烃，以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。Pt基催化剂具有高活性，可将石蜡转化为相应的烯烃，这一点在1940年代由Haensel的工作中得到了明确的证明。1960年代，Bloch进一步发展了这些催化剂，用于选择性地将长链线性石蜡脱氢为内部单烯烃，具有高活性和稳定性，同时将裂解降至最低。这导致了UOP PacolTM工艺的开发，用于生产线性烯烃以制造洗涤剂，到1999年，有超过30个商业单位在运行。基于Pt的脱氢催化剂单元通常在低于500°C的温和条件下运行，适用于重烯烃，但对于轻烯烃来说，这并不经济。1970年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在数年内保持最理想的稳定活性，无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生，这使得能够设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置，用于生产轻烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯，在超大气压下具有高选择性。这项技术被称为UOP OleflexTM工艺，截至2000年末，有多个商业单位在运行。然而，尽管通过Pt催化剂的催化脱氢生产乙烯具有高度选择性，但由于需要更苛刻的操作条件，导致催化剂过度积碳或需要成本更高的真空操作，因此尚未将这种脱氢技术扩展到乙烷。
2. 基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。这些催化剂通常用于丁烷到丁烯和丙烷到丙烯的脱氢。自1930年代末以来，铬铝催化剂已被用于石蜡到烯烃的脱氢，商业过程可实现30-60%的丁烷和丙烷的单程转化率，以及10-20%的C10-C14石蜡的转化率。2000年，通过催化脱氢使用这些催化剂，几乎生产了700万吨C3-C4烯烃和200万吨C10-C14范围的烯烃。使用基于金属氧化物的催化剂的目标包括接近平衡或接近平衡的转化率，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。最近在基于金属氧化物的催化剂方面的发展集中在提高选择性和转化效率，特别是在轻石蜡到烯烃的脱氢方面。与仍在发展的氧脱氢领域相比，使用这些催化剂的脱氢过程被认为是相对成熟和建立的。
