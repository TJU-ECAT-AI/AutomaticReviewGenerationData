[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
[7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
[9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
[14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
[17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."
[18] "The latter have evolved primarily out of investigations of methane oxidative coupling."
[19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
[20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
[21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
[22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
[23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
[25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
[26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
[27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
[28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
[29] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
[30] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water."
[31] "At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%."
[32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
[33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
[34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
[35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
[36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
[37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
[38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
[39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."
[40] "Although the catalyst did show some deactivation with time, it can still maintain an ethylene yield as high as 50% after 24 h."
[41] "Lin et al. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and Chonnam National University, Korea, found that a SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane."
[42] "Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity, but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence."
[43] "Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity."
[44] "At 34% conversion of ethane, they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene."
[45] "Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2."
[46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
[47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
[48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."
[49] "Longer-duration tests were not conducted."
[50] "The Ho2O3 with BaCl2 catalyst at 640 C yielded 57% conversion and 68% selectivity to ethylene."
[51] "Choudhary et al. at the National Chemical Laboratory, India, have examined strontium and other rare earth oxides deposited on sintered low surface area supports precoated with lanthanum and other rare earth oxides."
[52] "A Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst showed the highest activity and selectivity for ethane."
[53] "At 800 C, the Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst was capable of giving 60% conversion of ethane and greater than 80% selectivity to ethylene."
[54] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
[55] "At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%."
[56] "At 670 C, a catalyst containing cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide, and calcining of the catalyst was accomplished in the absence of oxygen at 670 C, gave an 85% conversion of ethane and a 86% selectivity to ethylene (25 vol.% ethane/75 vol.% air at 3 psig and 2400 GHSV)."
[57] "Addition of a halogen-containing compound, such as methyl chloride, increases ethylene yield."
[58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
[59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."

As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process.

1. 贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），自20世纪40年代以来已被用于催化脱氢。这些催化剂对石蜡脱氢至烯烃具有高活性。20世纪60年代，开发了Pt基催化剂，用于长链线性石蜡选择性脱氢至内部单烯烃，具有高活性、稳定性和最小裂解。这导致了UOP PacolTM工艺的产生，用于生产线性烯烃以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。到1999年，超过30个商业Pt催化脱氢装置正在运行，用于生产洗涤剂烷基化物。20世纪70年代，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需停工。这项技术，被称为UOP OleflexTM工艺，允许在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。截至2000年底，有多个丙烷和异丁烷脱氢装置在商业运行，总产能超过300万吨/年。然而，由于需要更苛刻的操作条件，导致催化剂过度积炭或需要成本更高的真空操作，通过Pt催化剂的催化脱氢生产乙烯尚未扩展到乙烷。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于乙烷至乙烯的氧脱氢。在300-500°C的温度下，使用含钒的可还原金属氧化物催化剂。乙烷与催化剂中的钼或钒反应，形成表面乙氧基，可以进行β-消除以形成乙烯。表面乙氧基可以进一步氧化以形成表面乙酸酯，导致水解时产生乙酸。通过修改元素组成和适当调整反应条件，催化剂可以被制成对乙烯或乙酸具有选择性。这些催化剂对乙烯的选择性约为70%，在70%的乙烷转化率下。在更高温度下，使用主要从甲烷氧化耦合研究中演变而来的非可还原和可还原金属氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂产生乙烯作为C2产物，有些催化剂从裂解反应中产生甲烷。除了碳氧化物，其他氧化产物在高温下基本不存在，因为它们在高温下不稳定。据报道，Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2、锂氯化物在硫酸化锆上、SrBi3O4Cl3、钡碳酸盐上的钒氧化物、SrFeO3δClσ和BaCl2与Ho2O3等催化剂在高乙烷转化率下对乙烯具有高选择性。然而，一些催化剂随时间显示出失活，长期保持活性和选择性对于经济过程至关重要。
