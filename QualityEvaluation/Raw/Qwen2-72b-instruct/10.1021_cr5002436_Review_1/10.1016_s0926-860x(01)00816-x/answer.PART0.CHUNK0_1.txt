[1] "Noble metal dehydrogenation catalysts A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, were first introduced in the mid-1960s for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. They have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. Platinum catalysts can maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration, thanks to continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology. The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under mild temperature conditions, allowing the catalyst to have a long life and high productivity. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used for the dehydrogenation of ethane. They operate at different temperature ranges, with some working at 300-400°C and others at 650-800°C. The higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as the C2 product, although some produce methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. The activity of these catalysts can be influenced by the presence of steam, which reduces coke formation, and by the acidic and basic nature of supports.
3. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts include the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. This approach facilitates the dehydrogenation of ethane by the reaction of CO2 with H2 to make CO+H2O and also with ethane and methane. The inclusion of steam in the feed leads to a reduction in coke formation. The use of CO2 as an oxidant also reduces the reaction temperature compared to steam cracking, resulting in lower coke formation on the catalyst.
4. The potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins include their ability to operate at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and coke formation. They also have the potential to produce higher yields of ethylene and other light olefins compared to noble metal-based catalysts. However, the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes to alkenes remains a challenge.

1. 贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，最初于20世纪60年代中期被引入，用于生产长链线性烯烃，以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。它们对将石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性。铂催化剂由于连续催化剂再生(CCR)技术的引入，可以在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下进行，使催化剂即使在高空间速度下也能保持长寿命和高催化效率。然而，轻石蜡的脱氢需要更高的温度，导致催化剂失活加速，需要频繁的催化剂再生。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于乙烷的脱氢。它们在不同的温度范围内工作，一些在300-400°C下工作，另一些在650-800°C下工作。高温过程倾向于只产生乙烯作为C2产品，尽管有些过程从裂解反应中产生甲烷。除了二氧化碳，其他氧化产物在高温下主要不存在，因为它们在高温下，特别是在与催化剂和氧气接触时不稳定。这些催化剂的活性可以受到蒸汽存在、支持物的酸性和碱性性质以及CO2与这些支持物反应性的影响。
3. 金属氧化物基催化剂的最新发展包括使用CO2作为乙烷氧脱氢的温和氧化剂。这种方法通过CO2与H2的反应来促进乙烷的脱氢，生成CO+H2O，同时也与乙烷和甲烷反应。在进料中加入蒸汽可以减少焦炭的形成。使用CO2作为氧化剂还可以降低与蒸汽裂解相比的反应温度，导致催化剂上焦炭形成减少。
4. 金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域潜在的优势包括它们能够在较低温度下运行，这可以减少能源消耗和焦炭形成。它们还有潜力比贵金属基催化剂产生更高产量的乙烯和其他轻烯烃。然而，开发高活性和选择性催化剂，用于选择性氧化烷烃为烯烃，仍然是一个挑战。
