[1] "Noble metal dehydrogenation catalysts A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[4] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[5] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[6] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[7] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins. The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically. Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[8] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[9] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intra-particle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[10] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[11] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism."
[12] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[13] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[14] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[15] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[16] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[17] "The heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[18] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[19] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadi- ene."
[20] "The latter was commercialized by the Petro-Tex Chemical Corp. [3] and was called the Oxo-DTM process."
[21] "A similar oxydehydrogenation approach for the production of butadiene was also practiced by Phillips Petroleum [3]."
[22] "Large quantities of butadiene have become available over the past 30 years, mostly as a by-product from the thermal cracking of naphtha and other heavy hydrocar- bons."
[23] "This market shift has resulted in the shutdown of all on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation units for butadiene production in North America, western Eu- rope, and the far East."
[24] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobuty- lene."
[25] "The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."
[26] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobuty- lene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."
[27] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propy- lene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."
[28] "Plans for another 450,000 MTA Catofin propane dehydrogenation unit in Saudi Ara- bia have also been announced."
[29] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S ud-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."
[30] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the for- mer Soviet Union."
[31] "This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor con- figuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries."
[32] "However, back- mixing common to dense fluidized bed operations re- sults in poor selectivity and increases the formation of heavies, sometimes called green oils."
[33] "Circulating regenerated catalyst is used to provide the heat of re- action in the riser and spent catalyst is reheated by carbon burn in the regenerator."
[34] "During the 1990s, a large scale fluid bed isobutane dehydrogenation unit for about 450,000 MTA isobutylene was commercial- ized by Snamprogetti in Saudi Arabia based on tech- nology from Yarsintez in Russia."
[35] "Recent literature articles report further improvements by Snamprogetti."
[36] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the sup- ply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[37] "Synthetic detergents, based on the use of branched alkylbenzene sulfonates derived from propylene tetramer and benzene, had been introduced in the 1940s."
[38] "By the early 1960s, however, it became appar- ent that branched dodecylbenzene-based detergents,though very active and offering excellent perfor- mance characteristics, did not biodegrade readily and were accumulating in the environment."
[39] "The need for biodegradable detergents prompted the development of catalytic dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to linear olefins."
[40] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the correspond- ing olefins."
[41] "In the 1960s, Bloch [10] further ex- tended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[42] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM pro- cess for the production of linear olefins for the man- ufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[43] "In 1999,there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed de- hydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[44] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
[45] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at rela- tively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[46] "While this is eco- nomical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
[47] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, accord- ing to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."
[48] "In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows:x2 e = Kp Kp + P"
[49] "where xe is the equilibrium conversion, P the total ab- solute pressure and Kp is the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[50] "The equilibrium con- stant can be easily calculated from Gibbs free energies as tabulated in the API 44 report or in similar sources of thermodynamic data."
[51] "Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the equilibrium conversion levels that can be obtained for propane at 1 and 0.23 atm abs. (175 Torr), respectively."
[52] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
[53] "Fig. 3 shows the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins ranging from ethane to pentadecane."
[54] "Fig. 4 shows the temperatures required to achieve 1040% equilibrium conversion based on these equilibrium constants."
[55] "Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins."
[56] "For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
[57] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[58] "Thus, ex- trapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."
[59] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydro- genation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[60] "Very importantly, it must be able to pro- duce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[61] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[62] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins,in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selec- tivities while still operating at superatmospheric pres- sures."
[63] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[64] "As of late 2000, there were four propane de- hydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydro- genation unit of this type in commercial operation,with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[65] "In addition, another propane dehydro- genation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propy- lene was under design and construction."
[66] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years."
[67] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[68] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[69] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor de- sign experience."
[70] "This reactor design resembles a typ- ical steam reformer that is operated until the catalyst deactivates as a result of coke deposition; banks of tubes are sequentially taken out of service for cata- lyst regeneration."
[71] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[72] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the correspond- ing feed paraffin."
[73] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[74] "The reaction pathways involved in heavy paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. detergent-range C10C14 n-paraffins) are more complicated than those in light paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. propane and isobutane)."
[75] "The main difference in reaction pathways is that a significant amount of cyclic compounds can form via dehydrocyclization from heavy paraffins;this is not the case for light paraffins."
[76] "Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate possible reactions that take place on Pt and acid (A) sites, respectively, in the dehydrogenation of light and heavy paraffins when the catalyst is not se- lective, e.g. unmodified platinum catalysts supported on alumina."
[77] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[78] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifi- cations."
[79] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions."
[80] "Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to de- hydrogenation."
[81] "Various by-products, as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6, can also form."
[82] "In addition, the catalyst rapidly deactivates due to fouling by heavy carbona- ceous materials."
[83] "Therefore, the properties of platinum and the alumina support need to be modified to sup- press the formation of by-products and to increase catalytic stability."
[84] "The reaction of olefins on platinum is faster than that of paraffins, because olefins interact with platinum more strongly than do paraffins."
[85] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin in- teraction."
[86] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[87] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation signifi- cantly."
[88] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[89] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[90] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[91] "The typical high surface area alumina supports em- ployed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomer- ization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[92] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[93] "Also, -alumina supports that have essen- tially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[94] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[95] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[96] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[97] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stabil- ity is greatly improved."
[98] "Over modified catalysts,the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler."
[99] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and me- chanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[100] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support ma- terial is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[101] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intra- particle mass transfer rate."
[102] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are low- ered."
[103] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[104] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases,and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[105] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
2.Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins at temperatures below 700 C. Notably, a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst has shown high selectivity to propylene. These catalysts are active for propane oxydehydrogenation and are among the most active catalysts for this reaction. At higher temperatures, metal oxides can also be used for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, with selectivities to olefins ranging from 50% to 80%. Recent developments include the use of V-Al2O3 catalytic membranes for the separation of propane and oxygen feeds, resulting in higher selectivities to propylene. Cyclic operation of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a V-Mg-O catalyst has also been examined, with increased selectivity to propylene compared to steady-state operation with mixed feeds.
3.Noble metal-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, particularly in the UOP OleflexTM process, which has been commercialized for the production of propylene and isobutylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts have been used in laboratory and pilot-scale studies for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, but their commercialization is still limited.
4.Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include high activity and selectivity, long catalyst life, and the ability to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for high selectivity to propylene and can be used at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and coke formation. However, metal oxide-based catalysts may require more frequent regeneration and may have lower stability compared to noble metal-based catalysts.

1.贵金属基催化剂，尤其是铂（Pt），自20世纪60年代中期以来已被用于轻烯烃的脱氢，最初用于生产用于可生物降解洗涤剂的长链线性烯烃。基于Pt的催化剂对将石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性。20世纪70年代，连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术被引入，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需停工进行再生。这些催化剂以氧化铝为载体，具有酸性位点，可以加速副反应并增强焦炭形成。为了控制酸性，使用碱金属或碱土金属，也可以使用无酸性的-氧化铝载体。改性催化剂具有高活性和选择性，对单烯烃具有高选择性，焦炭形成受到抑制，稳定性得到改善。氧化铝用作载体，因为其具有热稳定性、机械强度和维持高铂分散度的能力，这对实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。
2.金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已在700 C以下的温度下用于轻烯烃的脱氢。值得注意的是，一种钒-硅-锆氧化物催化剂显示出对丙烯具有高选择性。这些催化剂对丙烷氧脱氢具有活性，是这种反应中最活性的催化剂之一。在较高温度下，金属氧化物也可用于轻烯烃的脱氢，烯烃的选择性范围为50%至80%。最近的发展包括使用V-Al2O3催化膜分离丙烷和氧气进料，从而提高对丙烯的选择性。还研究了V-Mg-O催化剂的循环操作丙烷氧化脱氢，与混合进料的稳态操作相比，丙烯的选择性有所提高。
3.贵金属基催化剂已在工业应用中广泛用于轻烯烃的脱氢，特别是在UOP OleflexTM工艺中，该工艺已商业化用于生产丙烯和异丁烯。金属氧化物基催化剂已在实验室和中试规模研究中用于轻烯烃的脱氢，但其商业化仍有限。
4.贵金属基催化剂的潜在优势包括高活性和选择性、长催化剂寿命以及在几年内无需停工进行再生即可保持稳定活性的能力。金属氧化物基催化剂具有对丙烯具有高选择性的潜力，可在较低温度下使用，这可以降低能耗和焦炭形成。然而，金属氧化物基催化剂可能需要更频繁的再生，与贵金属基催化剂相比，其稳定性可能较低。
