          [1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
          [2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
          [3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
          [4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
          [5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
          [6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
          [7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
          [8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
          [9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          [10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
          [12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
          [13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
          [14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
          [15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
          [16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
          [17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."
          [18] "The latter have evolved primarily out of investigations of methane oxidative coupling."
          [19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
          [20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
          [21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
          [22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
          [23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
          [24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
          [25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
          [26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
          [27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
          [28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
          [29] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
          [30] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water."
          [31] "At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%."
          [32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
          [33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
          [34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
          [35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
          [36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
          [37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
          [38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
          [39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."
          [40] "Although the catalyst did show some deactivation with time, it can still maintain an ethylene yield as high as 50% after 24 h."
          [41] "Lin et al. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and Chonnam National University, Korea, found that a SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane."
          [42] "Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity, but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence."
          [43] "Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity."
          [44] "At 34% conversion of ethane, they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene."
          [45] "Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2."
          [46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
          [47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
          [48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."
          [49] "Longer-duration tests were not conducted."
          [50] "The Ho2O3 with BaCl2 catalyst at 640 C yielded 57% conversion and 68% selectivity to ethylene."
          [51] "Choudhary et al. at the National Chemical Laboratory, India, have examined strontium and other rare earth oxides deposited on sintered low surface area supports precoated with lanthanum and other rare earth oxides."
          [52] "A Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst showed the highest activity and selectivity for ethane."
          [53] "At 800 C, the Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst was capable of giving 60% conversion of ethane and greater than 80% selectivity to ethylene."
          [54] "Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements."
          [55] "At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%."
          [56] "At 670 C, a catalyst containing cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide, and calcining of the catalyst was accomplished in the absence of oxygen at 670 C, gave an 85% conversion of ethane and a 86% selectivity to ethylene (25 vol.% ethane/75 vol.% air at 3 psig and 2400 GHSV)."
          [57] "Addition of a halogen-containing compound, such as methyl chloride, increases ethylene yield."
          [58] "There is an indication that the catalyst loses activity with use over time for oxydehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
          [59] "If catalyst activity and selectivity can be maintained over long periods of time, this catalyst seems like a good potential candidate for use in an economical process for ethane oxydehydrogenation to ethylene."
          [60] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [61] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          [62] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
          [63] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
          [64] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
          [65] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
          [66] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
          [67] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
          [68] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
          [69] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
          [70] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
          [71] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
          [72] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
          [73] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
          [74] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
          [75] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
          [76] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
          [77] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."
          [78] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [79] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
          [80] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
          [81] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
          [82] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
          [83] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          [84] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium."
          [85] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [86] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [87] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          [88] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."

          Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by intraparticle mass transfer, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for optimal catalytic performance. Pt catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins under mild temperature conditions, allowing for long catalyst life and high productivity without the need for regeneration facilities. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures for economically attractive conversions, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts have been reported to have high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Recent developments include the use of vanadia-silica-zirconia catalysts for propane oxydehydrogenation, which have shown high selectivity to propylene at temperatures below 700 C. Pt catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the production of light olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have been used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. Pt catalysts have the advantage of high activity and selectivity, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Pt catalysts have the potential advantage of high activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins, while metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for lower cost and improved stability under high-temperature conditions. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins.

          自1940年代以来，特别是铂（Pt）的贵金属基催化剂已被用于催化脱氢。这些催化剂对将石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性。20世纪60年代，开发了Pt基催化剂，用于长链线性石蜡选择性脱氢至内部单烯烃，具有高活性、稳定性和最小裂解。这导致了UOP PacolTM工艺的产生，用于生产线性烯烃以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。到1999年，超过30个商业Pt催化脱氢装置正在运行，用于生产洗涤剂烷基化物。20世纪70年代，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需停工。这项技术，被称为UOP OleflexTM工艺，允许在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。截至2000年底，有多个丙烷和异丁烷脱氢装置在商业运行，总产能超过300万吨/年。然而，由于需要更苛刻的操作条件，导致催化剂过度积炭或需要成本更高的真空操作，通过Pt催化剂的催化脱氢生产乙烯尚未扩展到乙烷。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于乙烷至乙烯的氧脱氢。在300-500°C的温度下，使用含钒的可还原金属氧化物催化剂。乙烷与催化剂中的钼或钒反应，形成表面乙氧基，可以进行β-消除以形成乙烯。表面乙氧基可以进一步氧化以形成表面乙酸酯，导致水解时产生乙酸。通过修改元素组成和适当调整反应条件，催化剂可以被制成对乙烯或乙酸具有选择性。这些催化剂对乙烯的选择性约为70%，在70%的乙烷转化率下。在更高温度下，使用主要从甲烷氧化耦合研究中演变而来的非可还原和可还原金属氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂产生乙烯作为C2产物，有些催化剂从裂解反应中产生甲烷。除了碳氧化物，其他氧化产物在高温下基本不存在，因为它们在高温下不稳定。据报道，Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2、锂氯化物在硫酸化锆上、SrBi3O4Cl3、钡碳酸盐上的钒氧化物、SrFeO3δClσ和BaCl2与Ho2O3等催化剂在高乙烷转化率下对乙烯具有高选择性。然而，一些催化剂随时间显示出失活，长期保持活性和选择性对于经济过程至关重要。贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），自20世纪60年代中期以来已被用于轻烯烃的脱氢，最初用于生产长链线性烯烃，以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。Pt基催化剂对将石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性。20世纪70年代，引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需停工进行再生。这些催化剂以氧化铝为载体，具有酸性位点，可以加速副反应并增强焦炭形成。为了控制酸性，使用碱金属或碱土金属，也可以使用无酸性的-氧化铝载体。改性催化剂具有高活性和选择性，对单烯烃具有高选择性，焦炭形成受到抑制，稳定性得到改善。氧化铝用作载体，因为其具有热稳定性、机械强度和维持高铂分散度的能力，这对实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质的限制，必须为支撑确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。Pt催化剂用于在温和温度条件下脱氢长链石蜡，允许催化剂具有长寿命和高生产力，无需再生设施。然而，轻石蜡的脱氢需要更高的温度才能获得经济上吸引人的转化率，导致催化剂失活加速，需要频繁再生。金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。据报道，这些催化剂对将轻石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性和选择性。最近的发展包括使用钒-硅-锆催化剂进行丙烷氧脱氢，该催化剂在700 C以下的温度下对丙烯具有高选择性。Pt催化剂在工业应用中被广泛用于生产轻烯烃，而金属氧化物基催化剂已被用于将轻石蜡转化为烯烃。Pt催化剂具有高活性和选择性的优势，而金属氧化物基催化剂在高温条件下具有潜在的低成本和改善的稳定性。Pt催化剂具有潜在的优势，即对将轻石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性和选择性，而金属氧化物基催化剂在高温条件下具有潜在的低成本和改善的稳定性。最近在金属氧化物基催化剂方面的发展集中在提高轻石蜡转化为烯烃的选择性和稳定性上。
