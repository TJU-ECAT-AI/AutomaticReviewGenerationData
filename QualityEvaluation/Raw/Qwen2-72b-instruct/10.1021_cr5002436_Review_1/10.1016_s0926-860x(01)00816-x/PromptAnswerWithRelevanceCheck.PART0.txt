[1] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[4] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for the manufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[5] "In 1999, there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[6] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
[7] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[8] "While this is economical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
[9] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[10] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[11] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[12] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[13] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
[14] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[15] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[16] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
[17] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[18] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
[19] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[20] "The reaction pathways involved in heavy paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. detergent-range C10C14 n-paraffins) are more complicated than those in light paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. propane and isobutane)."
[21] "The main difference in reaction pathways is that a significant amount of cyclic compounds can form via dehydrocyclization from heavy paraffins; this is not the case for light paraffins."
[22] "Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate possible reactions that take place on Pt and acid (A) sites, respectively, in the dehydrogenation of light and heavy paraffins when the catalyst is not selective, e.g. unmodified platinum catalysts supported on alumina."
[23] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[24] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifications."
[25] "Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."
[26] "Various by-products, as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6, can also form."
[27] "In addition, the catalyst rapidly deactivates due to fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[28] "Therefore, the properties of platinum and the alumina support need to be modified to suppress the formation of by-products and to increase catalytic stability."
[29] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction."
[30] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[31] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
[32] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[33] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[34] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[35] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[36] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[37] "Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[38] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[39] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[40] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[41] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[42] "Over modified catalysts, the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler."
[43] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[44] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[45] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[46] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."
[47] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[48] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[49] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[50] "In paraffin dehydrogenation, the rate of paraffin conversion (x) and mono-olefin production (sx) are given by Eqs. (1) and (2) respectively:dx dt = f1(ki, Kipj) (1) d(sx) dt = f2(ki, Ki, pj) (2) where s is the selectivity to n-mono-olefins, t the contact time, f the rate function, ki the rate constant for reaction step i, Ki the equilibrium constant for reaction step i, and pj is the partial pressure of the j compound."
[51] "The following relationship between selectivity and conversion can be derived from Eqs. (1) and (2):d(sx) dx = f2(ki, Ki, pj) f1(ki, Ki, pj) (3) The ki and Ki are a function of temperature and pj is a function of conversion, total pressure (P), and feed ratio (R)."
[52] "Therefore, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as d(sx) dx = f2[ki(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R] f1[ki(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R] (4) As Eq. (4) is the ratio of two functions, the rate constants become relative values and can be expressed as ki(T)/k0(T), where k0(T) is the rate constant for the forward reaction of paraffin dehydrogenation to mono-olefins."
[53] "Eq. (4) can be written in a functional form in F as follows:d(sx) dx = F ki(T ) k0(T ), Ki(T ), x, P, R (5) Eq. (5) indicates that selectivity is a function of conversion for the catalyst used (relative rate constants) and the given reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed ratio)."
[54] "Selectivity decreases as the conversion increases because n-mono-olefins are consecutively converted into by-products."
[55] "Selectivity decreases sharply as conversion approaches equilibrium because the main dehydrogenation process is limited by equilibrium, but other reactions continue to occur."
[56] "Therefore, if side reactions are controlled, the selectivity is improved as the equilibrium conversion becomes higher by increasing the temperature and by decreasing the pressure and the feed ratio of hydrogen to paraffin."
[57] "The relationship between selectivity and conversion can be simulated according to Eq. (5), if rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants are known."
[58] "Fig. 8 shows simulated selectivities to n-heptene and n-heptadiene for the dehydrogenation of n-heptane."
[59] "In this simulation, the relative rate constants used are unity, which represents that the catalyst possesses perfect selectivity regarding consecutive dehydrogenation; the dehydrogenation rate of paraffin is equal to that of mono-olefin and diolefin."
[60] "Experimental selectivities obtained over a UOP dehydrogenation catalyst show good agreement with the predicted values."
[61] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism."
[62] "The rest of the equations may be derived accordingly."
[63] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[64] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[65] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[66] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[67] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[68] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[69] "Houdrys Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of stepsprocess, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[70] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[71] "UOPs Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[72] "Snamprogettis dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[73] "Here too the coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[74] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[75] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step; because several reactors are used in parallel, an average conversion is obtained."
[76] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[77] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[78] "In Oleflex adiabatic reactors, a significant temperature drop occurs across the catalyst bed which lowers the equilibrium conversion level; a multistage reactor system with interstage reheating is used for higher paraffin conversions."
[79] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single stage reactor system."
[80] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[81] "The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s."
[82] "During World War II, catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was practiced for the production of butenes that were then dimerized to octenes and hydrogenated to octanes to yield high-octane aviation fuel."
[83] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."
[84] "Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."
[85] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[86] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[87] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum."
[88] "Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[89] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed."
[90] "Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[91] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidantparaffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[92] "While catalytic dehydrogenation reflects a relatively mature and well-established technology, oxydehydrogenation can in many respects be characterized as still being in its infancy."
[93] "Oxydehydrogenation, however, offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the mid-1960s for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, as demonstrated by Haensel in the 1940s. Bloch further developed these catalysts in the 1960s for selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability, minimizing cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for linear olefin production for detergents, with over 30 commercial units in operation by 1999. Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units are typically operated under mild conditions below 500 C for heavy olefins, but this is not economical for light olefins. Continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology introduced by UOP in the early 1970s allowed noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years without shutdowns, enabling the design and operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units for light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process, with several commercial units in operation as of late 2000. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts, though selective, has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions that cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. These catalysts are typically employed in the dehydrogenation of butanes to butenes and propane to propylene. Chromia-alumina catalysts have been used since the late 1930s for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, with commercial processes achieving per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes, and 10-20% for C10-C14 paraffins. In 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10-C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation using these catalysts. The objectives in using metal oxide-based catalysts include approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts have focused on improving selectivity and conversion efficiency, particularly in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins. The use of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes is considered relatively mature and well-established compared to the still developing field of oxydehydrogenation.

1. 自1960年代中期以来，基于贵金属的催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），已被用于催化脱氢，用于生产长链线性烯烃，以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。Pt基催化剂具有高活性，可将石蜡转化为相应的烯烃，这一点在1940年代由Haensel的工作中得到了明确的证明。1960年代，Bloch进一步发展了这些催化剂，用于选择性地将长链线性石蜡脱氢为内部单烯烃，具有高活性和稳定性，同时将裂解降至最低。这导致了UOP PacolTM工艺的开发，用于生产线性烯烃以制造洗涤剂，到1999年，有超过30个商业单位在运行。基于Pt的脱氢催化剂单元通常在低于500°C的温和条件下运行，适用于重烯烃，但对于轻烯烃来说，这并不经济。1970年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在数年内保持最理想的稳定活性，无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生，这使得能够设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置，用于生产轻烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯，在超大气压下具有高选择性。这项技术被称为UOP OleflexTM工艺，截至2000年末，有多个商业单位在运行。然而，尽管通过Pt催化剂的催化脱氢生产乙烯具有高度选择性，但由于需要更苛刻的操作条件，导致催化剂过度积碳或需要成本更高的真空操作，因此尚未将这种脱氢技术扩展到乙烷。
2. 基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。这些催化剂通常用于丁烷到丁烯和丙烷到丙烯的脱氢。自1930年代末以来，铬铝催化剂已被用于石蜡到烯烃的脱氢，商业过程可实现30-60%的丁烷和丙烷的单程转化率，以及10-20%的C10-C14石蜡的转化率。2000年，通过催化脱氢使用这些催化剂，几乎生产了700万吨C3-C4烯烃和200万吨C10-C14范围的烯烃。使用基于金属氧化物的催化剂的目标包括接近平衡或接近平衡的转化率，同时最小化副反应和焦炭形成。最近在基于金属氧化物的催化剂方面的发展集中在提高选择性和转化效率，特别是在轻石蜡到烯烃的脱氢方面。与仍在发展的氧脱氢领域相比，使用这些催化剂的脱氢过程被认为是相对成熟和建立的。

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, were first introduced in the mid-1960s for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. They have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. Platinum catalysts can maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration, thanks to continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology. The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under mild temperature conditions, allowing the catalyst to have a long life and high productivity. However, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires higher temperatures, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation and necessitating frequent regeneration.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used for the dehydrogenation of ethane. They operate at different temperature ranges, with some working at 300-400°C and others at 650-800°C. The higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as the C2 product, although some produce methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. The activity of these catalysts can be influenced by the presence of steam, which reduces coke formation, and by the acidic and basic nature of supports.
3. Recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts include the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the oxydehydrogenation of ethane. This approach facilitates the dehydrogenation of ethane by the reaction of CO2 with H2 to make CO+H2O and also with ethane and methane. The inclusion of steam in the feed leads to a reduction in coke formation. The use of CO2 as an oxidant also reduces the reaction temperature compared to steam cracking, resulting in lower coke formation on the catalyst.
4. The potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins include their ability to operate at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and coke formation. They also have the potential to produce higher yields of ethylene and other light olefins compared to noble metal-based catalysts. However, the development of highly active and selective catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes to alkenes remains a challenge.

1. 贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，最初于20世纪60年代中期被引入，用于生产长链线性烯烃，以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。它们对将石蜡转化为烯烃具有高活性。铂催化剂由于连续催化剂再生(CCR)技术的引入，可以在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下进行，使催化剂即使在高空间速度下也能保持长寿命和高催化效率。然而，轻石蜡的脱氢需要更高的温度，导致催化剂失活加速，需要频繁的催化剂再生。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于乙烷的脱氢。它们在不同的温度范围内工作，一些在300-400°C下工作，另一些在650-800°C下工作。高温过程倾向于只产生乙烯作为C2产品，尽管有些过程从裂解反应中产生甲烷。除了二氧化碳，其他氧化产物在高温下主要不存在，因为它们在高温下，特别是在与催化剂和氧气接触时不稳定。这些催化剂的活性可以受到蒸汽存在、支持物的酸性和碱性性质以及CO2与这些支持物反应性的影响。
3. 金属氧化物基催化剂的最新发展包括使用CO2作为乙烷氧脱氢的温和氧化剂。这种方法通过CO2与H2的反应来促进乙烷的脱氢，生成CO+H2O，同时也与乙烷和甲烷反应。在进料中加入蒸汽可以减少焦炭的形成。使用CO2作为氧化剂还可以降低与蒸汽裂解相比的反应温度，导致催化剂上焦炭形成减少。
4. 金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域潜在的优势包括它们能够在较低温度下运行，这可以减少能源消耗和焦炭形成。它们还有潜力比贵金属基催化剂产生更高产量的乙烯和其他轻烯烃。然而，开发高活性和选择性催化剂，用于选择性氧化烷烃为烯烃，仍然是一个挑战。

[1] "Noble metal dehydrogenation catalysts A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[2] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[4] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[5] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[6] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[7] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins. The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically. Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[8] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[9] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intra-particle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[10] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[11] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism."
[12] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[13] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[14] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[15] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[16] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[17] "The heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[18] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[19] "The Houdry Catadiene process was used extensively for the production of butadiene, either by itself (n-butane to butadiene) or in conjunction with catalytic oxydehydrogenation of n-butene to butadi- ene."
[20] "The latter was commercialized by the Petro-Tex Chemical Corp. [3] and was called the Oxo-DTM process."
[21] "A similar oxydehydrogenation approach for the production of butadiene was also practiced by Phillips Petroleum [3]."
[22] "Large quantities of butadiene have become available over the past 30 years, mostly as a by-product from the thermal cracking of naphtha and other heavy hydrocar- bons."
[23] "This market shift has resulted in the shutdown of all on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation units for butadiene production in North America, western Eu- rope, and the far East."
[24] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobuty- lene."
[25] "The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."
[26] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobuty- lene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."
[27] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propy- lene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."
[28] "Plans for another 450,000 MTA Catofin propane dehydrogenation unit in Saudi Ara- bia have also been announced."
[29] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S ud-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."
[30] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the for- mer Soviet Union."
[31] "This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor con- figuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries."
[32] "However, back- mixing common to dense fluidized bed operations re- sults in poor selectivity and increases the formation of heavies, sometimes called green oils."
[33] "Circulating regenerated catalyst is used to provide the heat of re- action in the riser and spent catalyst is reheated by carbon burn in the regenerator."
[34] "During the 1990s, a large scale fluid bed isobutane dehydrogenation unit for about 450,000 MTA isobutylene was commercial- ized by Snamprogetti in Saudi Arabia based on tech- nology from Yarsintez in Russia."
[35] "Recent literature articles report further improvements by Snamprogetti."
[36] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the sup- ply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."
[37] "Synthetic detergents, based on the use of branched alkylbenzene sulfonates derived from propylene tetramer and benzene, had been introduced in the 1940s."
[38] "By the early 1960s, however, it became appar- ent that branched dodecylbenzene-based detergents,though very active and offering excellent perfor- mance characteristics, did not biodegrade readily and were accumulating in the environment."
[39] "The need for biodegradable detergents prompted the development of catalytic dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to linear olefins."
[40] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the correspond- ing olefins."
[41] "In the 1960s, Bloch [10] further ex- tended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[42] "This was the basis for the UOP PacolTM pro- cess for the production of linear olefins for the man- ufacture of biodegradable detergents."
[43] "In 1999,there were more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed de- hydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[44] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking."
[45] "Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at rela- tively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[46] "While this is eco- nomical for the production of heavy linear olefins, it is not for the production of light olefins."
[47] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, accord- ing to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."
[48] "In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows:x2 e = Kp Kp + P"
[49] "where xe is the equilibrium conversion, P the total ab- solute pressure and Kp is the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[50] "The equilibrium con- stant can be easily calculated from Gibbs free energies as tabulated in the API 44 report or in similar sources of thermodynamic data."
[51] "Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the equilibrium conversion levels that can be obtained for propane at 1 and 0.23 atm abs. (175 Torr), respectively."
[52] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogena- tion increases significantly as the carbon number in- creases."
[53] "Fig. 3 shows the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins ranging from ethane to pentadecane."
[54] "Fig. 4 shows the temperatures required to achieve 1040% equilibrium conversion based on these equilibrium constants."
[55] "Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraf- fins."
[56] "For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydro- genation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."
[57] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[58] "Thus, ex- trapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."
[59] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydro- genation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[60] "Very importantly, it must be able to pro- duce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[61] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[62] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins,in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selec- tivities while still operating at superatmospheric pres- sures."
[63] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[64] "As of late 2000, there were four propane de- hydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydro- genation unit of this type in commercial operation,with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[65] "In addition, another propane dehydro- genation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propy- lene was under design and construction."
[66] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years."
[67] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehy- drogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[68] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[69] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor de- sign experience."
[70] "This reactor design resembles a typ- ical steam reformer that is operated until the catalyst deactivates as a result of coke deposition; banks of tubes are sequentially taken out of service for cata- lyst regeneration."
[71] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[72] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the correspond- ing feed paraffin."
[73] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[74] "The reaction pathways involved in heavy paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. detergent-range C10C14 n-paraffins) are more complicated than those in light paraffin dehydrogenation (e.g. propane and isobutane)."
[75] "The main difference in reaction pathways is that a significant amount of cyclic compounds can form via dehydrocyclization from heavy paraffins;this is not the case for light paraffins."
[76] "Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate possible reactions that take place on Pt and acid (A) sites, respectively, in the dehydrogenation of light and heavy paraffins when the catalyst is not se- lective, e.g. unmodified platinum catalysts supported on alumina."
[77] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[78] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifi- cations."
[79] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions."
[80] "Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to de- hydrogenation."
[81] "Various by-products, as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6, can also form."
[82] "In addition, the catalyst rapidly deactivates due to fouling by heavy carbona- ceous materials."
[83] "Therefore, the properties of platinum and the alumina support need to be modified to sup- press the formation of by-products and to increase catalytic stability."
[84] "The reaction of olefins on platinum is faster than that of paraffins, because olefins interact with platinum more strongly than do paraffins."
[85] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin in- teraction."
[86] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[87] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation signifi- cantly."
[88] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[89] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[90] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[91] "The typical high surface area alumina supports em- ployed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomer- ization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[92] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[93] "Also, -alumina supports that have essen- tially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[94] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[95] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[96] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[97] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stabil- ity is greatly improved."
[98] "Over modified catalysts,the major reaction pathways for both light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation systems are simpler."
[99] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and me- chanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[100] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support ma- terial is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[101] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intra- particle mass transfer rate."
[102] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are low- ered."
[103] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[104] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases,and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[105] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins since the mid-1960s, initially for the production of long-chain linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. Pt-based catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1970s, continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology was introduced, allowing noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. These catalysts are supported on alumina, which has acidic sites that can accelerate side reactions and enhance coke formation. To control acidity, alkali or alkaline earth metals are used, and -alumina supports with no acidity can also be utilized. Modified catalysts have high activity and selectivity to mono-olefins, with suppressed coke formation and improved stability. Alumina is used as a support due to its thermal stability, mechanical strength, and ability to maintain high platinum dispersion, which is crucial for high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
2.Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the dehydrogenation of light olefins at temperatures below 700 C. Notably, a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst has shown high selectivity to propylene. These catalysts are active for propane oxydehydrogenation and are among the most active catalysts for this reaction. At higher temperatures, metal oxides can also be used for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, with selectivities to olefins ranging from 50% to 80%. Recent developments include the use of V-Al2O3 catalytic membranes for the separation of propane and oxygen feeds, resulting in higher selectivities to propylene. Cyclic operation of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a V-Mg-O catalyst has also been examined, with increased selectivity to propylene compared to steady-state operation with mixed feeds.
3.Noble metal-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial applications for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, particularly in the UOP OleflexTM process, which has been commercialized for the production of propylene and isobutylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts have been used in laboratory and pilot-scale studies for the dehydrogenation of light olefins, but their commercialization is still limited.
4.Potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts include high activity and selectivity, long catalyst life, and the ability to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdown for regeneration. Metal oxide-based catalysts have the potential for high selectivity to propylene and can be used at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption and coke formation. However, metal oxide-based catalysts may require more frequent regeneration and may have lower stability compared to noble metal-based catalysts.

2.金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已在700 C以下的温度下用于轻烯烃的脱氢。值得注意的是，一种钒-硅-锆氧化物催化剂显示出对丙烯具有高选择性。这些催化剂对丙烷氧脱氢具有活性，是这种反应中最活性的催化剂之一。在较高温度下，金属氧化物也可用于轻烯烃的脱氢，烯烃的选择性范围为50%至80%。最近的发展包括使用V-Al2O3催化膜分离丙烷和氧气进料，从而提高对丙烯的选择性。还研究了V-Mg-O催化剂的循环操作丙烷氧化脱氢，与混合进料的稳态操作相比，丙烯的选择性有所提高。
3.贵金属基催化剂已在工业应用中广泛用于轻烯烃的脱氢，特别是在UOP OleflexTM工艺中，该工艺已商业化用于生产丙烯和异丁烯。金属氧化物基催化剂已在实验室和中试规模研究中用于轻烯烃的脱氢，但其商业化仍有限。
4.贵金属基催化剂的潜在优势包括高活性和选择性、长催化剂寿命以及在几年内无需停工进行再生即可保持稳定活性的能力。金属氧化物基催化剂具有对丙烯具有高选择性的潜力，可在较低温度下使用，这可以降低能耗和焦炭形成。然而，金属氧化物基催化剂可能需要更频繁的再生，与贵金属基催化剂相比，其稳定性可能较低。

[17] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation as a route to ethylene has been examined at temperatures in the range of 300500 C with reducible metal oxide catalysts, and at higher temperatures, above about 600 C, with largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts."
[18] "The latter have evolved primarily out of investigations of methane oxidative coupling."
[19] "In the oxidative coupling of methane, ethane and ethylene are major products, and ethylene has been shown to be derived from ethane."
[20] "The dehydrogenation or oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, must occur over these catalysts, and since the overall selectivity is high, the selectivity to ethylene must be good."
[21] "In addition to these two lines of research, recent work at high temperatures using Pt and Pt-Sn on a monolith support has been reported."
[22] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 300400 C is conducted with reducible metal oxide catalysts usually containing vanadium."
[23] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[24] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis."
[25] "Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
[26] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions."
[27] "Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane."
[28] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 500 C may be conducted with phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts or iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with one or more metal oxides."
[29] "Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of 78% at 20% conversion of ethane."
[30] "Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water in addition to ethane and water."
[31] "At a contact time of 12 s at 550 C over an iron in -alumina solid solution catalyst stabilized with lanthanum oxide, ethane conversion is in the range of 90%."
[32] "Products are ethylene (8093% selectivity) and vinyl chloride (14% selectivity)."
[33] "As a route to ethylene-only, this route seems unattractive because of the production of vinyl chloride, which must be separated from ethylene."
[34] "For vinyl chloride producers, however, where the stream may be able to be used without separation, such a high selectivity/conversion process to ethylene may possibly be economically attractive."
[35] "Ethane oxydehydrogenation at temperatures in the range of 650800 C is conducted with a variety of materials, most not containing the elements molybdenum and vanadium, which are common in lower-temperature catalysts."
[36] "As opposed to the lower-temperature catalysts which tend to produce coproducts, the higher temperature processes tend to produce only ethylene as C2 product, though some do produce methane from cracking reactions."
[37] "Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides largely are absent, likely because of their instability at high temperature, especially in contact with the catalyst and oxygen."
[38] "Li and coworkers at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have shown that a Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane."
[39] "Wang and coworkers at the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research, Japan, found that lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane."
[40] "Although the catalyst did show some deactivation with time, it can still maintain an ethylene yield as high as 50% after 24 h."
[41] "Lin et al. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and Chonnam National University, Korea, found that a SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane."
[42] "Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity, but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence."
[43] "Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity."
[44] "At 34% conversion of ethane, they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene."
[45] "Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2."
[46] "Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene."
[47] "At 680 C, SrFeO3δClσ yielded 90% ethane conversion and 70% selectivity."
[48] "Over 40 h, there was no drop-off in yield or in chlorine content of the catalyst."

1. Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), have been used in catalytic dehydrogenation since the 1940s. These catalysts have high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins. In the 1960s, Pt-based catalysts were developed for the selective dehydrogenation of long-chain linear paraffins to internal mono-olefins with high activity, stability, and minimum cracking. This led to the UOP PacolTM process for the production of linear olefins for biodegradable detergents. By 1999, over 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units were in operation for detergent alkylate production. In the 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology for noble metal catalysts, enabling them to maintain stable activity for several years without shutdowns. This technology, known as the UOP OleflexTM process, allows for the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities under superatmospheric pressures. As of late 2000, there were multiple propane and isobutane dehydrogenation units in commercial operation with a combined capacity of over 3 million MTA. However, the production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts has not been extended to ethane due to the need for more severe operating conditions, which cause excessive coking or require costlier vacuum operation.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have been used in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. At temperatures of 300-500°C, reducible metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium are used. Ethane reacts with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can undergo beta-elimination to form ethylene. The surface ethoxide can be further oxidized to make surface acetate, leading to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions. Selectivity to ethylene with these catalysts is approximately 70% at 70% conversion of ethane. At higher temperatures, above 600°C, largely non-reducible and reducible metal oxide catalysts are used, evolved primarily from investigations of methane oxidative coupling. These catalysts produce ethylene as the C2 product, with some producing methane from cracking reactions. Oxygenated products other than carbon oxides are largely absent due to their instability at high temperatures. Catalysts such as Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2, lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia, SrBi3O4Cl3, vanadium oxide on barium carbonate, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 have been reported to give high selectivity to ethylene at high conversion of ethane. However, some catalysts show deactivation over time, and the maintenance of activity and selectivity over long periods is crucial for an economical process.

1. 贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），自20世纪40年代以来已被用于催化脱氢。这些催化剂对石蜡脱氢至烯烃具有高活性。20世纪60年代，开发了Pt基催化剂，用于长链线性石蜡选择性脱氢至内部单烯烃，具有高活性、稳定性和最小裂解。这导致了UOP PacolTM工艺的产生，用于生产线性烯烃以制造可生物降解的洗涤剂。到1999年，超过30个商业Pt催化脱氢装置正在运行，用于生产洗涤剂烷基化物。20世纪70年代，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持稳定的活性，无需停工。这项技术，被称为UOP OleflexTM工艺，允许在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。截至2000年底，有多个丙烷和异丁烷脱氢装置在商业运行，总产能超过300万吨/年。然而，由于需要更苛刻的操作条件，导致催化剂过度积炭或需要成本更高的真空操作，通过Pt催化剂的催化脱氢生产乙烯尚未扩展到乙烷。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，已被用于乙烷至乙烯的氧脱氢。在300-500°C的温度下，使用含钒的可还原金属氧化物催化剂。乙烷与催化剂中的钼或钒反应，形成表面乙氧基，可以进行β-消除以形成乙烯。表面乙氧基可以进一步氧化以形成表面乙酸酯，导致水解时产生乙酸。通过修改元素组成和适当调整反应条件，催化剂可以被制成对乙烯或乙酸具有选择性。这些催化剂对乙烯的选择性约为70%，在70%的乙烷转化率下。在更高温度下，使用主要从甲烷氧化耦合研究中演变而来的非可还原和可还原金属氧化物催化剂。这些催化剂产生乙烯作为C2产物，有些催化剂从裂解反应中产生甲烷。除了碳氧化物，其他氧化产物在高温下基本不存在，因为它们在高温下不稳定。据报道，Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2、锂氯化物在硫酸化锆上、SrBi3O4Cl3、钡碳酸盐上的钒氧化物、SrFeO3δClσ和BaCl2与Ho2O3等催化剂在高乙烷转化率下对乙烯具有高选择性。然而，一些催化剂随时间显示出失活，长期保持活性和选择性对于经济过程至关重要。

[10] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
[11] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[12] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[13] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[14] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[15] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."

[17] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[18] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[19] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[20] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[21] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[22] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[23] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."

[25] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C."
[26] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[27] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[28] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[29] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
