Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of platinum-based catalysts supported on silica and L-zeolite for isobutane dehydrogenation. These catalysts exhibit high selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins at elevated temperatures. The addition of tin and potassium to platinum-based catalysts further improves their performance by reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species, and suppressing hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. The literature does not provide information on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in this context.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了在硅胶和L-沸石上支持的铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的有效性。这些催化剂在高温下对轻石蜡的脱氢显示出高选择性和稳定性。向铂基催化剂中添加锡和钾可以进一步提高其性能，通过减小表面铂簇的尺寸，抑制高度脱氢表面物种的形成，以及抑制氢解、异构化和焦化反应。文献没有提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。
