1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of platinum-based catalysts supported on silica and L-zeolite for isobutane dehydrogenation. These catalysts exhibit high selectivity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins at elevated temperatures. The addition of tin and potassium to platinum-based catalysts further improves their performance by reducing the size of surface platinum ensembles, inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species, and suppressing hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. The literature does not provide information on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in this context.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了在硅胶和L-沸石上支持的铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的有效性。这些催化剂在高温下对轻石蜡的脱氢显示出高选择性和稳定性。向铂基催化剂中添加锡和钾可以进一步提高其性能，通过减小表面铂簇的尺寸，抑制高度脱氢表面物种的形成，以及抑制氢解、异构化和焦化反应。文献没有提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。
