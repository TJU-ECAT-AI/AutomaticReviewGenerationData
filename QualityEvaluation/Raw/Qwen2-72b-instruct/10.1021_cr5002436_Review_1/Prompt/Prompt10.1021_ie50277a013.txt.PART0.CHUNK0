Equilibrium Dehydrogenation of Ethane, Propane, and the Butanes
F. E. FREY
AND W. F. HUPPKE,
Phillips Petroleum Company, Bartlesville, Okla.
HE formation of paraf- fins from the corre-
T
sponding olefins by com- bination with hydrogen has been shown to take place readily at moderate temperature in the presence of suitable catalysts,such as cobalt, nickel, copper,iron, silver, platinum, and palla- dium (1 3)- The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins and hydrogen,however, is t h e r m o d y n a m i - cally possible only at somewhat elevated temper a t ur es . At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, plati- num, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3).
Dehydrogenation has been re- ported, however.
Tausz and P u t n o k y  (16) passed the vapors of pentane, Eihane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane are dehydrogenated to the corresponding ole$ns and hydrogen at 350" to 500" C. and 760 mm. pres- sure by means qf a catalyst prepared from air- dried chromic oxide gel. Equilibrium dissocia- tion is obtained with litfle interference from side reactions, and equilibrium constants are deter- mined for the seoeral hydrogenation-dehydrogena- tion reactions.
Extent o f dissociation increases with increase in the number o f alkyl substituents attached to the ethylene group in the olefin pro- duced. n-Butane forms all three of the possible n-butenes.
The equilibrium dissociation is the same for the formation of l-butene as for pro- pylene. Both 2-butenes are produced in higher concentration, the lower boiling (trans) isomer be- ing a little the more abundant and hence more stable. hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300" C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydro- carbons. The I. G. Farbenindustrie Akt.-Ges. (7') reports that amylene was the chief product formed when pentane was passed over activated charcoal at 450" to 500" C.
In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocar- bons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350" to 500" C. Side reactions were not marked under proper conditions, and hydrogenation as well as dehydrogenation took place without serious com- plications. In the present study this catalyst was used to bring about equilibrium in mixtures of several paraffins- namely, ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane, with their dissociation products, and thus to determine by direct meas- urement the equilibrium constant for every possible reaction of the type: CnHzn+z i CnHzn + Hi The ethane-ethylene equilibrium has been determined di- rectly by Pease (Id). Ethane decomposes into ethylene and hydrogen, and ethylene and hydrogen unite to form ethane at 600" to 700" C. in the absence of a catalyst and without ex- cessive side reaction; satisfactory equilibrium values are ob- tained by approaching equilibrium from both sides at these temperatures. The higher paraffins, however, decompose under such conditions through fracture of carbon-carbon bonds as well as dehydrogenation.
Consequently, this method is not applicable to them and the use of the catalyst is required. In the experiments to be described, propane was found to be more highly dissociated into olefin and hydrogen at equilibrium than ethane, and isobutane was still more highly dissociated; the dissociation amounted to 1.2, 4.5, and
9.2 per cent, respectively, for ethane, propane, and isobutane
at 400" C. and 760 mm. pressure. n-Butane exhibited a high extent of dissociation (8.5 per cent under the same conditions) by reason of the fact that equi- librium concentrations of all three of the normal butenes- namely, 1-butene and the cis and trans isomers of 2-butene-were formed independently.
A
study of the dehydrogenation of other hydrocarbons is in progress.
It is also possible to determine equilibrium constants or free energy change for the dissocia- tion of paraffins by calculation from thermal data (4,10,17),but the possibility of appreciable errors arising from small errors in heats of combustion has been recognized, and the direct deter- mination is accordingly desir- able particularly for compar- ing the stabilities of isomeric olefins.
ESPERIbIENTAL PROCEDURE
APPARATVS
ASD IETHOD.
The apparatus used for the catalytic conversion is shown in Figure 1.
The gas to be treated passed through drying tube A containing magnesium perchlorate trihydrate, through flowmeter B and was delivered at a pressure of 760 mm. indicated by manometer C into catalyst tube E of Pyrex glass, 7 mm. in inside diameter and con- taining a 5-cc. portion of granular catalyst. In order to obtain an even reaction temperature, a heavy steel sheath, F, was located inside the furnace, D, and surrounding the catalyst tube. Ther- mocouple G, at the inner surface of F, was used to measure the temperature, and in some instances a thermocouple imbedded in the catalyst near the exit was used to insure that the reaction temperature was correctly shown by G. The gas leaving the catalyst tube was discharged through bubbler H ,  and a sample for Orsat analysis was drawn into I when the desired conditions had been established. Large samples for fractionation analysis were taken into a large evacuated bottle, or condensed at liquid nitrogen temperature when the determination of hydrogen and methane were unnecessary.
RIATERIALS. The ethane was prepared from a commercial
product containing a little ethylene. The ethylene was re- moved by passing repeatedly through fuming sulfuric acid and finally sodium hydroxide solution, after which the ethane was condensed and purified by fractional distillation. Propane,n-butane, and isobutane were prepared from natural gas con- densate by careful fractionation. None of the hydrocar- bons contained more than one per cent of homologs or isomers except the isobutane, which contained 1.5 per cent n-butane.
No more than traces of other impurities were present. The propylene was a pure commercial product. 1-Butene was prepared by the interaction of allyl bromide and methylmag- nesium iodide, and purified by fractional distillation.

Eight hundred grams of Baker's c.

After 2 hours the gelatinous precipitate was filtered off on a Biiohner funnel,washed three times by stirring into 30 liters of hot distilled water and filtering,and finally dried in an air bath at 50" C.

the gel was further dried in UQCUO for 8 hours while the temperature was raised gradually to 250' C., after which it was ready for use.A 5-cc. portion was then placed in the catalyst tube and electrolytic hydrogen, purified by passing through copper gauze at 400" C. and magnesium perchlorate trihydrate, was passed through while the tempera- ture was gradually raised to 400" C. over a period of 5 hours.
Pure propane under atmospheric pressure was then passed over the gel at 400" C. at a rate of 10 liters per hour for the 5-cc. portion of granular catalyst. Dehydrogenation ac- tivity gradually developed and full activity was reached in several hours with the formation of nearly equilibrium con- centrations of about 4 per cent each of hydrogen and pro- pylene. The black vitreous appearance of the catalyst re- mained unchanged throughout.
-4NALYTICAL IETHODS
The determination of olefins and hydrogen was carried out in an Orsat apparatus (1) connected by glass-to-glass seals to avoid the solvent effect of rubber. A mercury-filled gas pipet was used for the determination of olefins by sulfuric acid absorption. Portions of acid (1 cc.) were used to mini- mize absorption of paraffins. Ethylene, propylene and n-bu- tenes, and isobutylene were determined by absorption in fuming (10 per cent sulfur trioxide) 85 per cent and 65 per cent acid, respectively. Because of the marked tendency of the butane to dissolve in stopcock grease, a soap-glycerol lubri- cant vas used in the analysis of samples high in butane.
In several cases the analysis of the products of reaction was carried out with the aid of fractional distillation, and in this way by-products were determined which could not be deter- mined by the simpler Orsat method described. The result of fractionation analysis, however, showed that the Orsat method was adequate for the greater part of the work. In the fractionation method, the products of the catalytic reaction were fractionated in a column of the type described by Ober- fell and Alden (9) and Podbielniak (14). All material boiling lower than the paraffi treated (and its corresponding olefins) consisted of hydrogen and by-products.
This material was separated by the column and subsequently analyzed by the Shepherd-Porter method (6,15) which is suitable for handling small quantities. The main paraffin-olefin fraction was then distilled overhead for separate examination. Little higher- , boiling material w a s
found. coloration persisted after several minutes at - 10" to -20" C.
The butane was then distilled off without ebullition at -75"
C., and, since the formation of the tetrabromide from buta-
diene dibromide takes place somewhat slowly, an excess of one per cent of bromine was added and the mixture kept at 0" C. for 15 hours to complete the addition of bromine to the butadiene. The excess bromine was then removed by aqueous sodium sulfite, after which the bromides were dis- tilled at +40' to +60 c.,and 0.5 mm. pressure. The dis- tillation residue of semi-crystalline butadiene tetrabromide was estimated by weighing. Under these conditions, substi- tution reactions did not take place appreciably. The dis- tillate containing only the dibromides was then converted back into butenes by treating with zinc dust in 85 per cent ethyl alcohol. The butenes were distilled from the alcohol through a calcium chloride tube into a fractionating column 1 1 ,,,,

(Table 11, experiment 3) for separating the isomers. Yields of 95 to 100 per cent were obtained. By analyzing synthetic mixtures, it was shown that the composition of a mixture of the isomeric butenes was changed little by this sequence of operations.
The determination of the individual n-butenes is somewhat difficult because of their similarity. The boiling point differ- ences are small, but, since a fractionating column capable of giving an analytical separation was available, it was used for the purpose. The boiling points are as follows: 1-butene,-6.5" to -6.7"

RESULTS
OF DEHYDROGENATION
In order to determine the extent of side reactions and secondary reactions in addition to the predominating hydro- genation and dehydrogenation, propane, propane plus pro- pylene plus hydrogen, and n-butane were passed over the catalyst at flow rates low enough to allow equilibrium to be established, and the products were analyzed by fractionation.
The results are shown in Table I. A little falling off in ac- tivity took place during the collecting of enough of the product for fractionation analysis. Since equilibrium was established, the operating conditions were evidently favorable also for the hydrogenation of the olefins to paraffins.

was approached from both sides. The composition of the exit gas is nearly the same for both experiments. The equi- librium constant calculated from the mean of the hydrogen- propylene averages is in agreement with later experiments (Figure 4) performed with more active catalyst.

Experiments 3 and 4 show small proportions of methane,ethylene, and ethane produced by reactions involving the fracture of carbon-carbon bonds, in addition to the products of simple dehydrogenation. These by-products were evi- dently formed by catalytic action, since the temperatures were too low to cause appreciable homogeneous decomposition.
Since they are virtually all paraffinic, hydrogenation equi- librium among these by-products having been established,the simpler Orsat analysis was used for the determination of equilibrium constants to be described.
DETERMINATION
OF EQUILIBRIUM
CONSTANTS.
Equilib- rium constants for the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reac- tion were determined for ethane at 400, 450", and 500" C.,and for propane, isobutane, and n-butane at 350", 400, and 450" C. The usual procedure was to treat at 400" C. a fresh 5-cc. portion of catalyst with propane to develop catalytic activity using a moderate flow rate of 10 liters per hour until an analysis of the exit gas showed a propylene content of at least 75 per cent of the equilibrium concentration of 4.5 per cent. The catalyst was then brought to the desired tempera- ture and the gas to be treated was passed over the catalyst under 750 to 760 mm. pressure at several flow rates, beginning with the highest; a sample of the exit gas was taken for analysis at each flow rate. A thermocouple imbedded in the catalyst showed a temperature below that of the tube sheath only at flow rates of 10 liters per hour or more. After the several samples were taken at one temperature, propane was again passed over the catalyst at 400" C. and the propylene content determined to test for excessive loss in activity. A fresh portion of catalyst was usually taken for each paraffin at each temperature, but only at temperatures of 450" C. or higher did a marked loss in activity often take place in less than 4 hours' running time. A high activity was maintained for much longer periods under the best conditions.

The samples were analyzed in the Orsat apparatus. Olefins were determined by sulfuric acid absorption, hydrogen was determined by copper oxide combustion, and the remainder was assumed to be the paraffin treated. These values were used to calculate equilibrium constants. At 450" and 500" C. this procedure involves appreciable errors, and since, more- over, the catalyst lost activity at high temperatures, the data obtained above 400" C. were given the least weight.
Figures 3 to 6 show the composition of the off-gas from the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, isobutane, and n-butane at the several temperatures and flow rates; Table I1 shows the analyses for the individual butenes produced from n-butane in separate experiments in which equilibrium was not quite attained.

Since dehydrogenation approached equilibrium even at the higher flow rates, the limiting concentrations approached with increase in contact time were assumed to represent equi- librium concentrations.
This procedure was justified by the agreement between equilibrium values so obtained, and those obtained with somewhat spent catalyst by approaching equi- librium from both sides (Tables I and 11). At the lowest flow rates an increase in hydrogen due to side reaction was

Table I11 shows the equilibrium constants calculated from the data of Figures 3 to 6 and Table I1 according to the mass action equation:concentrations being in atmospheres. In Figure i,the values of K in Table I11 have been plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. The values for the ethane-ethylene equilibrium obtained by Pease (12) and the present values obtained at much lower temperatures are in good agreement and lie on a practically straight line. Because of the wide range of temperature covered in this case. an extrapolation to 298" K. appeared justifiable.

500 550 eo 0 650 700 rium data for ethane. An intermediate value of ASZss = 27 was arbitrarily assumed for all the other dehydrogenations studied for the purpose of calculating the free energy change over a range of temperature. While small individual differ- ences in entropy change undoubtedly exist among the reac- tions studied, a value of AS298 higher or lower by 2 entropy units affects the values of AF in the useful temperature range only slightly. Inasmuch as the several temperatures used for the dehydrogenation experiments did not cover a wide range, and the data at the extreme temperatures were the least accurate, the curves were drawn in Figure 7 with the aid of the foregoing equations to accommodate the best single ex- perimental value of K, assuming ACP equal to 4.0 calories and AS298 equal to 27, for propane, n-butane, and isobutane.
It is not thought that the displacement of any experimental values of K from the curves exceeds the experimental error.
This method of calculation may involve large errors in AH and AF at 298" K., but the error in AF is probably in no case more thah several hundred calories at temperatures of 573 " to 873" K. (300' to 600" C.) where these reactions are of im- portance, The data are for the most part correct and com- parable within narrower limits than this.
ETHANE,
PROPANE,
AND koBuTAxE. From the data of Pease the free energy change of the dehydrogenation of ethane at 298" K. was calculated by Parks and Huffman (IO) to be 22,600 calories. This value is confirmed by the present data. In the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene a somewhat lower free energy change takes place (Table IV).
This appears to be due mostly to an increase in stability of the ethylene molecule caused by the substituent methyl group.
The free energy change is still lower for the formation from isobutane of isobutylene, an unsymmetrical dialkyl ethylene (Table IV). In the dehydrogenation of isobutane, no n- butene was formed, and evidently no rearrangement took place.
In the dehydrogenation of n-butane, all three of the known isomers-I-butene,n's-2-butene1 and trans-2- butene-were formed. For the determination of the indi-
BUTANE.
vidual isomers, 40 to 80 grams of n-butane were passed over the catalyst, and the butenes separated and analyzed by the method described in the analytical section. Low flow rates were chosen to allow all the dehydrogenation reactions to come practically to equilibrium. The data are shown in Table 11.
That the equilibrium proportions of the three butenes were produced is shown by the hydrogenation of a mixture of 1- butene, hydrogen, and n-butane (Table 11, experiment 2 ) .
The proportion of each butene is substantially the same as in the case of the dehydrogenation experiments.
While the equilibrium concentrations were not quite attained except at the lower temperature by reason of loss in activity of the cata- lyst during protracted use, the similarity in the several analy- ses indicates that this loss in activity did not affect the pro- portions of products appreciably.

The cis- and trans-2-butenes (disubstituted ethylenes) required less free energy than 1-butene, and are accordingly more stable. O f
the two 2-butenes, trans-Zbutene is somewhat the more stable thermodynamically.
The equilibrium proportions of these three isomers should change only slowly with change in temperature. 1,a-Butadiene was also formed in small amounts. The tetrabromide from experiment 5, Table 1 1 ,
melted after recrystallization at 117" C. Quantities of buta- diene of the order of one per cent of the butenes would be ex- pected from the withdrawal of a second molecule of hydrogen.

In addition, the in- creasing number of independent dehydrogenation reactions which a paraffin can undergo increases with molecular weight,and the extent to which the paraffin dissociates should in- crease accordingly.

Behavior of Activated Carbon with Metallic Water-Purification Equipment
A. s. BEHRMAN AND H. GUSTIFSON,
International Filter co., Chicago, 1 1 1 .
S
THE early part of 1929 the writers organization began actively the commer- cial development in this country of the use of granular highly ac- tivated carbon for water purifica- tion, primarily for the removal of objectionable tastes and odors.
It was natural that the first com- mercial units designed for the purpose should follow the design and construction of the conven- tional pressure sand filter, with the sand replaced by granular activated carbon.
Two weeks after the first in- stallation of this sort mas made in Chicago, it was reported that the effluent water from the activated carbon purifier contained an ap- preciable quantity of ferric hy- droxide. Although this report It has been found that a relaticely high po- tential difference is set up between a bed o f
activated carbon and the metallic water-purijica- tion equipment in which the carbon is used.
This behavior is not exhibited by wood charcoal or other carbons previously employed in water purification.
A dielectric lining is now pro- cided for such metallic equipment in order to avoid injury to the carbon, contamination o f the water, and eventual destruction o f the metallic equipment. Typical comparative data are given showing Ihe potenfial differences set up between various types o f carbons and a number o f metals.
The suggestion is made that there may be a relationship between the potential differences set up under certain conditions and the activity o f
carbons in some types o f adsorption phenomena. for installation; there was no reason t o  expect fate to be kinder in those situations than it had been in Chicago.
CARBON-hTETdL TESTS Operating on one of the hunches that is frequently the salvation of any research labora- tory, a short section of steel pipe was filled with granular Hydro- darco (the activated carbon used by the writers organiza- tion) and covered with Chicago city water. Electrical connec- tions were then made from the steel and from the carbon to a sensitive millivoltmeter.
The needle was deflected violently across the entire scale.
Tests with other common metals and allovs showed the was somewhat annoying, no special concern was felt at the time,since it was believed that the source of ferric hydroxide could probably be accounted for by the corrosive effects of the oxygen in Lake Michigan water on the new steel tank of the purifier;and, since this water is characteristically slightly supersatu- rated with calcium carbonate, it was confidently felt that a protective coating would be deposited on tkle steel fairly rapidly, thus arresting further corrosion.
Accordingly, a second examination was made a few weeks later. The situation was fully as bad as before, if not worse.
Not only was the amount of ferric hydroxide in the effluent water decidedly objectionable in itself, but it was plainly only a question of time before the carbon would be definitely injured by the coating of ferric hydroxide, and before serious disintegration of the steel shell would result.
The problem was one which obviously required a quick solution. To make matters worse, several similar pieces of equipment were on their way to various parts of the country same effect, though to a varying degree fn all cases the activated carbon was found to be cathodic to the metallic element of the couple, thus accounting for disintegration and eventual disappearance of the metal.
Other highly activated carbons were next tried, with similar results.
With relatively inactive forms of carbon, however,such as the -wood charcoal and bone black previously em- ployed in water purification, no potential difference could be detected.
In Table I are shown the potential differences observed between various types of carbons and a number of different metals and alloys. The apparatus used in making these measurements consisted of a specially prepared electrode of the carbon being tested, a plate or rod of the metal, and a sensitive voltmeter. The carbon electrode comprised a slotted hard-rubber tube (taken from the positive element of an Exide Ironclad storage battery) filled with particles of the carbon, thoroughly washed, and screened uniformly through
