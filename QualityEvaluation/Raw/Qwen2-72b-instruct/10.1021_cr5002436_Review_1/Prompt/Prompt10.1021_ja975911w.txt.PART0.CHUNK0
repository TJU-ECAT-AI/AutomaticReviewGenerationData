I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Budavari, M. O'Neill, A. Smith, P. Heckelman, and J. Kinneary (Merck & Co., Inc.). Chapman & Hall: New York. 1997. $250.00. ISBN 0-412-75940-3.James K. Whitesell View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF This publication is licensed under the terms of your institutional subscription. Request reuse permissions.Copyright  1998 American Chemical Society Subjects what are subjects Color Manufacturing Mathematical Methods Pharmaceuticals Transition Temperature The Merck Index has served many organic chemists as a convenient, comprehensive, and highly accurate source of detailed information on 10,000 drugs and common chemical intermediates. This resource is now available in a searchable electronic version. The Apple Macintosh version was evaluated for this review. A Macintosh PowerPC or 68040 processor, a color monitor (minimum 640 × 480 and 256 colors), a quad speed CD-ROM drive, 8 Mbyte of RAM, 12 Mbyte of hard disk space, and Mac OS 7.5 or higher are required.The search engine for The Merck Index is quite powerful, with three search routines with increasing complexity and power. The Quick Search is a simple search of all fields that uses Boolean logic operators as well as truncation and wild card operators. The Menu Search is more detailed, permitting combined searches in any of the available fields which include all names; all text; all entries; additional name; boiling point; CA name; CAS registry number; density; derivative type; drug code; manufacturer name; melting point; molecular formula; molecular weight; monograph number; note; properties; refractive index; rotation; therapeutic category; title name; toxicity; trade name; use; and UV maxima.The Command Search is less structured but more powerful than either of the simpler routines, and searches can be save and then combined to find, for example, entries that meet the restrictions of multiple searches. In addition, there is a substructure searching routine that can be used alone or in combination with text searches. Dedicated Macintosh users will find the interface a bit awkward at first, but facility with the program is gained quickly and easily. The search engine is used with other electronic databases available from Chapman & Hall, and operations not appropriate to The Merck Index are dimmed. This is a nice feature for users who will frequently use the engine with several of these databases which include The Dictionaries of Natural Products, Organic Compounds, and Inorganic and Organometallic Compounds.Chemical structures found with any of the search methods can be copied to the clipboard and used in other applications. The clipboard information is compatible with both Chemintosh (Softshell) and ChemDraw (CambridgeSoft Corp.), and structures pasted into either of these applications can be fully manipulated.Author Information Author James K.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
