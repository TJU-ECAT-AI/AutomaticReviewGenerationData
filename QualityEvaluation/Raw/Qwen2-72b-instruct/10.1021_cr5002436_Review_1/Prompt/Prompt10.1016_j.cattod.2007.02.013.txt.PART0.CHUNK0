By use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, the presence of bimetallic PtSn phases was assessed after reduction at 773 K. Microcalorimetric analysis of CO adsorption enthalpy indicates that reduction at 773 K causes the appearance of a more heterogeneous distribution of active sites, as well as a loss in the amount of sites. The catalytic activity for the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was greatly improved when the catalysts were prepared by coimpregnation, at both reduction temperatures. The selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was higher after reduction at 773 K and independent of the preparation method, although it increased with the amount of tin, suggesting a promoting effect of tin on this reaction.

1. Introduction
Supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts are widely used for reforming and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the petroleum industry and for selective hydrogenation reactions in fine chemistry because of their better performance, in terms of activity and stability, than monometallic platinum catalyst [15]. As an example, the addition of tin to platinum modifies the selectivity in naphtha reforming, resulting in a higher resistance against deactivation by coke deposition [5].
In the field of fine chemistry, the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to obtain the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is a reaction of industrial importance.
In addition, it is a suitable model reaction to investigate the effect of the catalyst structure on the selectivity. Since the hydrogenation of the
C C
bond is thermodynamically favoured, the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is generally poor. In this case, monometallic platinum catalysts give no or a very low selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol.
An improvement in the selectivity can be often obtained by the addition of a second metal of the first transition row, a p block metal or an alkali element. Previous studies reported the use of Fe [6], Ga, Ge, Sn [714] and K [15,16]. The enhancement of catalytic selectivity by addition of tin has been explained as a result of the cooperation of two phenomena. On one hand, the carbonyl group is activated by ionic tin species, which interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bond and thus facilitate its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the dilution of platinum atoms by metallic tin hinders the hydrogenation of the C C bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol formed, thus inhibiting its isomerisation to the saturated aldehyde and even its further hydrogenation to the saturated alcohol [12,14,17,18].
Another way of improving the selectivity toward the unsaturated alcohol is the use of supports such as CeO2 [19 21], TiO2 [11,22], ZnO [23], MgO [18], or SnO2 [24] that can modify the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic system. Tauster et al. [25,26] found that the use as a support of a partially reducible oxide, such as TiO2, could modify the chemisorption ability of metals from groups 8, 9 and www.elsevier.com/locate/cattod Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 * Corresponding author.E-mail address: reinoso@ua.es (F.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.cattod.2007.02.013 10 for hydrogen and carbon monoxide after reduction at high temperature (about 773 K). The term strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) was introduced to describe this effect.
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this interaction could also modify the activity and selectivity of noble metal in different reactions, such as those involving molecules contain- ing carbonyl bonds. Vannice et al. found the promoter effect of TiO2 on metals from group 8 after reduction at 773 K for several reactions. They showed that the activity for CO hydrogenation was much greater on Pd/TiO2 in the SMSI state than for palladium supported on silica, alumina, or silica alumina [27,28]. Similar results have been found during hydrogenation of acetone [29], crotonaldehyde [22,30,31],acetophenone [32], phenylacetaldehyde [33], and benzalde- hyde [34] on Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Resasco and Haller [35] proposed a model involving a delocalized charge transfer from the metal to TiO2 after low temperature reduction, and a localized charge transfer from the support to the metal after high temperature reduction. Some years later, these authors suggested that the migration of reduced species from the support onto the metal particle occurred after reduction at high temperature [36]. This geometrical effect would account for the decrease in the chemisorption capacity of hydrogen and carbon monoxide of the catalysts in the SMSI state, because the amount of surface platinum atoms is diminished. Moreover, the creation of special sites at the interface between the metal and the partially reduced support would account for the enhanced selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols. These sites, which consist of partially reduced TiOx species (Ti3+ or oxygen vacancies) would interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, weakening the bond and thereby facilitating hydro- genation.
The preparation mode of bimetallic catalysts has a great importance, because the interaction between both metals and the support, which determines the catalytic behaviour, depends greatly on the preparation method used. The aim of this work has been the study of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with different Pt:Sn atomic ratios prepared by two different methods: coimpregnation of both metal precursors or succes- sive impregnation with the tin precursor loaded first. The catalysts were tested in the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The influence of the strong metalsupport interaction effect on this reaction is also studied by using low (473 K) and high (773 K) reduction temperature treatments.
2. Experimental
Degussa P25 TiO2 (60% anatase, 40% rutile), with a surface area of 50 m2 g1 (N2, 77 K, BET method) was used as support,which was previously calcined in air at 773 K for 5 h. Two PtSn/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a coimpregnation method (C-PtSn/TiO2), with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl66H2O (Johnson Matthey) of the appropriate concentration to achieve a Pt content of 2 wt%, and SnCl22H2O (Aldrich). Catalysts with nominal Pt:Sn atomic ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 were prepared. The slurry (10 ml/g of support) was stirred for 12 h and then the excess solvent was removed by heating at 363 K under vacuum in a rotary evaporator. Finally, the catalysts were dried at 383 K for 24 h and calcined under a flow of synthetic air at 673 K for 4 h, with a heating rate of 5 8C/min.
Two more PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, with the same composition as samples prepared by coimpregnation, were prepared by a successive impregnation method (S-PtSn/TiO2). The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl22H2O (Aldrich) and dried at 383 K overnight, and then it was impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl66H2O (Johnson Matthey). Drying and calcination treatments were the same as described for the coimpregnated catalysts.
XPS spectra were acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka
300 W
(hn = 1253.6 eV,1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder samples were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and reduced in H2 for 1 h at 473 and 773 K before being transferred to the analysis chamber. Before recording of spectra, the sample was maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure of 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by fitting the experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%) and Gaussian (70%) lines. Binding energies were referenced to the Ti 2p3/2 line in TiO2 at 458.5 eV, which provide values with an accuracy of 0.2 eV. The surface Pt/Ti and Pt/Sn ratios were estimated from the integrated intensities, after correction for atomic sensitivity factors [37].
FTIR experiments were carried out using a quartz cell fitted with CaF2 windows and an external furnace. Catalyst samples were prepared as 16 mm diameter self-supporting disks by pressing 70 mg of loose powder between polished steel dies at 15 MN m2. Prior to any measurements, samples were reduced in situ under a hydrogen flow (50 cm3 min1) at 473 or 773 K for 1 h. After reduction, samples were out-gassed at the reduction temperature for 15 min, to a final pressure of 105 Torr, before cooling to ambient temperature. Pulses of CO were introduced at 298 K using calibrated volumes and an Edward active strain gauge to measure the pressure of the pulse.
FTIR spectra were recorded after each pulse without outgassing at 4 cm1 resolution and averaging 25 scans per spectrum.
Microcalorimetric measurements were performed at 298 K using a Setaram BT2.15D heat-flux calorimeter. The calori- meter was connected to a volumetric system employing a Baratron capacitance manometer for precision pressure measurement (0.001 Torr). The maximum leak rate of the volumetric system (including the calorimetric cell) was 105 Torr min1 min in a system volume of approximately 60 cm3. The samples (between 0.3 and 0.8 g) were reduced ex situ in high purity hydrogen (50 cm3 min1) at 473 or 773 K for 1 h. After reduction, samples were out-gassed at the reduction temperature for 15 min, and then purged at the same temperature for 1 h in high purity helium to remove any adsorbed hydrogen. The samples were sealed in a Pyrex NMR tube and placed in a special calorimetric cell. When thermal

nez et al. / Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 236 equilibrium was reached, the capsule was broken, and small pulses of CO were introduced until the catalyst became saturated. The resulting heat response for each pulse was recorded as a function of time and integrated to determine the energy released. The differential heat (kJ mol1) was defined as the negative of the enthalpy change of adsorption per mole of gas adsorbed.The vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2- butenal) was carried out in a micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure operating under differential conditions. The catalysts (between 0.01 and 0.03 g) were reduced in situ at 473 or 773 K under flowing H2 (50 cm3 min1) for 1 h and then cooled under H2 to reaction temperature (333 K). The hydrogenation reaction was carried out using a reaction mixture (total flow:50 cm3 min1; H2/aldehyde ratio of 26) of H2 and crotonalde- hyde (Fluka, >99.5%), which was prepared by passing H2 through a thermo-stabilised saturator (293 K) containing crotonaldehyde. The concentration of reactants and products was determined by online GC with a Carbowax 20 M 58/90 semicapillary column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XPS characterization
The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels for the catalysts reduced in situ at 473 and 773 K for 1 h are reported in Table 1. In some cases two values are given, as a result of the deconvolution of the main peak into two contributions. The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratios are also presented (which can be used as an estimation of the platinum dispersion on the titania support), as well as the surface Pt/Sn atomic ratios. Additionally, the relative amounts of oxidized tin species (Snox/Sntotal), estimated from the integral of XPS peaks, are also given.
The Pt 4f spectra for the S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalyst reduced at 473 and 773 K are compared in Fig. 1. In this region, the spectra show two peaks. The one at lower binding energy corresponds to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level. For all catalysts, the peaks are quite similar, and for the sake of brevity, only the Pt 4f spectra for the catalyst S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) is shown and discussed. When the sample was reduced at 473 K a single peak, centred at 71.2 eV, appears for the Pt 4f7/2 level. This value is characteristic of platinum in the metallic state. After reduction at 773 K the peak is shifted to lower binding energy,
70.6 eV, and this can be attributed to several factors, such as a
decrease in the surface chloride levels or even metal sintering. It should be noted that the intensity of the peak is lower when the sample is reduced at higher temperature, indicative of a lower amount of detectable surface platinum.
The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the catalysts reduced at 473 and 773 K are plotted in Fig. 2. The spectra show a shift in the binding energy towards lower values with increasing reduction temperature, thus indicating the reduction of oxidized tin species. One or two bands appear when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, which can be ascribed to tin in higher oxidation states. Discrimination between Sn(II) and Sn(IV) species with XPS is difficult, as their binding energies are too close; therefore they have been considered together as oxidized tin species. The spectra for catalyst S-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) shows a small band centred at 484.7 eV which does not appear in the other catalysts after reduction at low temperature.
This contribution is attributed to reduced tin [11,38].

J. Ruiz-Mart
nez et al. / Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 237 The spectra show a broadening of the Sn 3d5/2 peaks with an increase in reduction temperature, with the appearance of a shoulder at low binding energies. This facilitated deconvolu- tion of the experimental spectra into two peaks; one at low binding energy values, assigned to metallic tin, and the other one at higher binding energies, attributed to oxidized tin species. The surface composition of the bimetallic catalysts reduced at 473 and at 773 K is different. Whereas platinum is in metallic state after both reduction treatments, tin is in an oxidized state when catalysts are reduced at 473 K, and in both oxidized and metallic states after reduction at 773 K. The presence of metallic tin in the catalysts reduced at 773 K opens up the possibility for the existence of bimetallic PtSn phases after this treatment, although this cannot be readily assessed by XPS.
After reduction at both temperatures, the Pt/Ti atomic ratio of the catalysts decreases as the amount of tin decreases (see Table 1). On the other hand, a decrease in this ratio is also observed when the reduction temperature is increased for a given catalysts that can be assigned to three main effects: (i) dilution of platinum by metallic tin, upon the formation of Pt:Sn bimetallic phases, (ii) covering of metal particles surface by oxidized tin species and (iii) formation of partially reduced titanium oxide, TiO2x, that can migrate onto the surface of the metallic particles leading to partial decoration. By comparing the different methods of preparation, it can be concluded that higher dispersions are obtained, as determined by XPS, with the coimpregnation method.
The Pt/Sn ratio decreases when the amount of tin increases,and also after reduction at high temperature, which can be Fig. 2. XPS Sn 3d spectra of the reduced PtSn/TiO2 catalysts: (a) C-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1), (b) C-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1), (c) S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) and (d) S-PtSn/TiO2 (1:1).
J. Ruiz-Mart
nez et al. / Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 238 attributed to the effects previously discussed. After reduction at high temperature, catalysts prepared by successive impregnation have a higher surface enrichment with tin species, which probably indicates a close proximity between platinum and tin,this favouring surface enrichment with tin species. On the other hand, the surface Pt:Sn atomic ratio is, in all cases, lower than the bulk one, thus indicating a surface segregation of tin species.
The ratio between the oxidized tin species and the total amount of tin (Snox/Sntotal) shows that tin is all in an oxidized state after reduction at 473 K, except for the S-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalyst where a small amount, ca. 4%, is in a metallic state.
After reduction at 773 K, a fraction of tin is in the metallic state.
The extent of tin reduction strongly depends on the preparation method in samples with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 1:1, for which the sample prepared by the successive impregnation method has a higher amount of metallic tin suggesting a greater extent of interaction with platinum.
3.2. CO adsorption microcalorimetry
Table 2 reports the CO/Pt ratios obtained from CO adsorption at room temperature on the different catalysts.
These values have been calculated by taking into account the total platinum loading and assuming that no CO is adsorbed on tin sites, as well as the CO uptake deduced from the amount of CO adsorbed with a heat of adsorption higher than 40 kJ/mol.
Fig. 3 shows the differential heat of CO adsorption as a function of the coverage at 298 K for catalysts reduced at 473 K. The profiles for all catalysts are very similar. The initial heat of adsorption is about 125 kJ/mol, but when the CO coverage increases the value decreases, reaching a plateau at around 100 kJ/mol. The constant value of the plateau extends over a wide range of coverage. At higher coverage there is a drastic decrease in the differential heat of adsorption, which indicates a saturation of the surface sites. The high initial heat of adsorption can be attributed to a small amount of CO adsorbed on low coordinated platinum atoms, as corners or edges [39],and the plateau indicates an energetic homogeneity of the metal atoms, giving a slight decrease in the heat of adsorption with coverage, probably arising from interactions between neigh- bouring CO molecules [40].
The CO uptakes for PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalysts are similar (Table 2), being slightly higher for the catalyst prepared by successive impregnation. However, between the PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts, the CO uptake for the catalyst prepared by coimpregnation is more than twice that of its counterpart prepared by successive impregnation. Chemisorption data are not in good agreement with the Pt/Ti XPS atomic ratios (Table 1), and these results could be explained by a partial coverage of the metal particle surface by a thin layer of tin oxide species. This thin layer would allow the photo-electrons emitted from the underlying platinum atoms to be detected.
Different differential heat of adsorption profiles are obtained after reduction at high temperature (Fig. 4). Catalysts with a Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 2:1 showed similar heat-coverage profiles,the initial heat of adsorption being about 140 kJ/mol, and the heat of adsorption strongly decreasing with coverage, thus indicating a heterogeneous distribution of active sites. The saturation coverage for CO adsorption decreases when the Table 2 CO uptake and CO/Pt ratios for catalysts reduced at both 473 and 773 K Catalyst Treatment CO uptake (mmol g1) CO/Pt C-PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) Red. 473 K 18

J. Ruiz-Mart
nez et al. / Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 239 reduction temperature increases (Table 2), which correlates with the atomic Pt/Ti ratios obtained by XPS. This loss in adsorption capacity can be associated with the migration of partially reduced titania particles to the platinum surface and a diluting effect by formation of Pt:Sn bimetallic phases.
Catalysts with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 1:1 reduced at 773 K show different heat-coverage profiles depending on the preparationmethod. Whereas thecatalystprepared bysuccessive impregnation has the same profile than catalysts discussed previously, the catalyst prepared by coimpregnation has a lower initial heat of adsorption (110 kJ/mol), which was maintained until saturation of the surface. This suggests a higher homogeneity of the surface metal atoms for CO adsorption than their counterparts after reduction at high temperature. The CO uptake decreases when compared with catalysts reduced at 473 K, which is ascribed to the effects previously discussed.It is important to remark that the CO uptake (ca. 13 mmol g1) is similar for all catalysts reduced at high temperature, and that it is independent of both the amount of tin and the preparation method.
3.3. Infrared spectroscopy
Fig. 5 compares the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed at room temperature on the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts, after in situ reduction at 473 K. In all cases, catalysts were exposed at 298 K to increasing CO doses until reaching 50 Torr, followed by evacuation under high vacuum for 1 h at 298 K. All spectra exhibit bands in the 21502000 cm1 region, which are assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on the different metallic sites [41,42]. For PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalysts (Fig. 5a), the spectrum obtained after introduction of a CO dose of less than 0.1 Torr contains only a broad band centred at 2073 cm1 and a shoulder around 2040 cm1. An increase in the CO pressure produces a blue shift of the main band, which is at 2083 cm1 at the highest coverage, as well as an increase in the intensity of all bands. The Fig. 4.

773 K.

J. Ruiz-Mart
nez et al. / Catalysis Today 123 (2007) 235244 240 bands are composed of two or more contributions, with the relative intensity of the highest frequency component being enhanced to a greater extent by an increase in the CO pressure.
A broad band is observed at 1900 cm1 due to bridge-bonded
CO. There is also a band centred at 2188 cm1, which is
assigned to CO adsorbed on the support [43], and which readily disappears after evacuation at 298 K.
The FTIR spectra of PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts reduced at 473 K (Fig. 5b) showed the same features as those discussed previously, although the greater amount of tin produced a shift to lower band positions for CO on linear sites (to 2070 cm1 at low coverage and 2078 cm1 at the highest coverage). The band attributed to bridge-bonded CO was less prominent for catalysts with a higher amount of tin.
After reduction at 773 K, the band due to linearly adsorbed CO is detected at lower wavenumbers when compared to catalysts reduced at 473 K (Fig. 6). Spectra of PtSn/TiO2 (2:1) catalysts showed, at low coverage, a maximum in intensity at 2065 cm1. As in the previous spectra, it is followed by a shoulder at 2040 cm1. At the highest coverage, the band is blue shifted to 2080 and 2072 cm1 for the coimpregnation and successive impregnation catalysts, respectively. Bands at lower wavenumbers were found for CO adsorption on PtSn/TiO2 (1:1) catalysts, the bands being centred at 2056 and 2062 cm1 for coimpregnation and successive impregnation catalysts, respec- tively, at low coverage, and 2066 at the highest coverage.
The band due to bridge-bonded CO was not detected after reduction at high temperature. Nevertheless, two bands appear at high CO coverage, at 2208 and 2188 cm1, which correspond to CO adsorbed on partially reduced titania and unreduced titania, respectively. These bands disappear after evacuation under vacuum at 298 K.
Comparing these results with previous studies on mono- metallic Pt/TiO2 catalysts [43,44] after reduction at 473 K, it can be concluded that the effect of tin addition was to shift the dominant band due to CO linearly adsorbed to lower wavenumbers, and this is consistent with previous results on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts [45,46]. Bands can be assigned by
