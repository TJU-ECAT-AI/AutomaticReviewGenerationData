Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation Josephine M. Hill, R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic* Department of Chemical Engineering, University of WisconsinMadison, Madison, WI 53706, USA Received 26 August 1997; received in revised form 31 October 1997; accepted 2 November 1997 Abstract Reaction kinetics measurements, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K in pure isobutane and at 873 K with a 2 : 1 hydrogen : isobutane feed. Highly selective dehydrogenation catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt and Sn on K-L-zeolite, as well as by depositing Pt, Sn, and K on silica. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited signicantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst. Addition of Sn and K to Pt decreased the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts by reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other undesirable products (e.g. hydrogenolysis). The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support. In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K. At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles. # 1998 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
Catalysts that employ Pt and Sn on neutral supports exhibit high selectivity and stability for the dehydro- genation of light parafns at elevated temperatures (see, e.g. Refs. [16]). Such catalysts are required in selective dehydrogenation processes because of a growing demand for olens such as propene and isobutene. Previous investigations have shown that L-zeolite and silica-supported Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K cata- lysts are highly selective for isobutane dehydrogena- tion to isobutene at temperatures below 773 K, and these materials exhibit good stability in the presence of hydrogen [47]. The combined results of adsorption microcalorimetry, reaction kinetics measurements,and Mo ssbauer spectroscopy have shown that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles,which decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated sur- face species involved in isomerization, hydrogenoly- sis, and coking reactions [4].

P I I S 0 9 2 6 - 8 6 0 X ( 9 7 ) 0 0 3 3 8 - 4 addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn cata- lysts increases the activity and selectivity for isobu- tane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles [6]. Furthermore, supporting tin and platinum on the potassium form of L-zeolite produces a catalyst that exhibits higher rates of iso- butane dehydrogenation than Pt/Sn/silica and Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalysts in the presence of hydrogen at tem- peratures below 773 K.
Dehydrogenation reactions are highly endothermic (100 kJ/mol) and are thermodynamically favored by higher temperatures and lower pressures. In the pre- sent study, the dehydrogenation of isobutane to iso- butene was investigated over silica- and L-zeolite- supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts. Selectivities were determined at 873 K with a 2 : 1 hydrogen-to- isobutane molar ratio (equilibrium dehydrogenation conversion of 58%) as well as at 798 K with pure isobutane (equilibrium dehydrogenation conversion of 42%). At these conditions, deactivation of the differ- ent catalysts was observed. Accordingly, catalysts were characterized by a combination of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and chemisorption measurements to elucidate the origins of deactivation during isobu- tane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
L-zeolite-supported catalysts were prepared using sequential impregnations of tin and platinum. The K- L-zeolite (Tosoh) was calcined in dry air at 873 K for 20 h, dried in owing helium at 673 K for 2 h, and transferred to a nitrogen atmosphere. Tin was added to the L-zeolite using incipient wetting with a solution of tributyltin acetate (Aldrich) in methanol. The sample was next dried in air at 390 K for 2 h and treated at 573 K in a owing mixture of 25 mol% oxygen in helium for 1 h. This Sn/L-zeolite sample was trans- ferred to a nitrogen atmosphere and the platinum added by incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution of tetraammineplatinum nitrate (Aldrich). After treatment at 533 K in a owing mixture of 25 mol% oxygen in helium for 1 h, the Pt/Sn/L catalyst was reduced in hydrogen at 873 K for 6 h (temperature ramp of 2 K/min), transferred to a glass vial in a nitrogen atmosphere and stored for further use.
Silica-supported platinum catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange, using the method of Benesi et al.,[8]. After ion-exchange, the Pt/silica catalysts were ltered, washed with deionized water, and dried over- night in air at 390 K. A portion of the catalyst was treated in owing oxygen at 573 K for 2 h, followed by reduction in owing hydrogen at 673 K for 2 h. Tin was added to the remaining uncalcined Pt/silica cata- lyst by evaporative impregnation of a tributyltin acetate in pentane solution, after which the catalyst was dried overnight in air at 390 K. Potassium was added to some of the Pt/Sn/silica catalyst by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of KOH, and the catalyst was dried in air at 390 K.
The Pt/Sn/silica and Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts were calcined with owing oxygen at 673 K for 2 h and,subsequently, reduced in owing hydrogen at 773 K for 7 h. Elemental compositions (Galbraith Labora- tories) of all catalysts are given in Table 1.

a quartz, U-tube reactor. Helium (Liquid Carbonic) was employed as a carrier gas, and it was puried by passage through copper turnings at 473 K, followed by activated molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. Isobutane (Liquid Carbonic, 99.5%) was treated by passage over beds of reduced Oxytrap (Alltech) and reduced Ni/ alumina at 373 K. Hydrogen (Liquid Carbonic) was treated by passage through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard) andabedofmolecularsieves(13X)at77 K.Thereactor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed by an HP-5890 gas-chromatograph with an FID detector and a 10-foot 15% Squalane Chromsorb PAW column at 323 K.
The apparatus used for the temperature pro- grammed oxidation (TPO) studies is similar to the apparatus used for the reaction kinetic studies. It is constructed of stainless-steel, equipped with mass ow controllers (Hastings), and attached to a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Isobutane (Liquid Carbonic, 99.5%) was passed over a bed of reduced Oxytrap (Alltech) at
333 K.
Hydrogen (Liquid Carbonic) was owed through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard) and a bed of molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. Helium (Liquid Carbonic) was owed through Cu turnings at 423 K and a bed of molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. The reactor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed by an HP-5890 gas chromatograph with a TCD detector and a 30 ft, 23% AT Chromosorb PAW column at 333 K. The mass spectrometer is a Quad 250B residual gas analyzer with an electron multiplier detector, operated at pressures of 103 Pa with an electron energy of 70 volts, and an emission current of 150 mamps. Calibration of the mass 44 signal was achieved using a gas mixture of 5% carbon dioxide in helium (AGA).
The vacuum apparatus used for chemisorption mea- surements is constructed from glass, with a stainless- steel dosing section and a Baratron capacitance man- ometer. Carbon monoxide (Liquid Carbonic) was puried by passage through a heated quartz wool trap at 573 K to remove metal carbonyl compounds, and then dried by passage through molecular sieves at 77 K. Isobutane (Liquid Carbonic) was puried with three freeze/pump/thaw cycles before starting adsorp- tion measurements. The gas uptake amounts (mmol/g) were calculated by extrapolating the plateau of the adsorption isotherm to zero pressure.
Transmission electron microscopy studies were con- ducted using a high-resolution microscope (Phillips CM 200 equipped with a LaB6 lament) at a point resolution of 0.2 nm and a magnication range of 25 to 1 600 000. A spot size of 120 nm was used to minimize electron beam damage to the specimens.
Samples were prepared by grinding the catalyst in a mortar and pestle with ltered water (18 M de- ionized water). A drop of the slurry was placed on specially prepared copper grids (1000 mesh, Ted Pella) that had been previously dipped in an adhesive solution made by dissolving the adhesive from double- sided tape in naphtha. The sticky grid with the drop of catalyst slurry was then placed over a hot plate to evaporate the water. The resulting grid contains par- ticles which overhang the edge of the grid bars and are transparent to the electron beam.
3. Results
3.1. Reaction kinetics studies at 873 K in the
presence of H2 Kinetic data for high isobutane conversions were obtained at 873 K, 33.7 kPa isobutane pressure,
67.6 kPa hydrogen pressure (2 : 1 hydrogen : hydro-
carbon ratio), and a WHSV of 13.2 h1 over silica- supported Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts as well as a 1 : 2 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst. At these reaction condi- tions, the equilibrium conversion to isobutene is 58%.
These kinetic studies were performed with 2035 mesh catalyst particles packed between quartz glass plugs in a narrow quartz U-tube reactor. This reactor conguration eliminated gas-phase reactions, as con- rmed by kinetic testing of an empty reactor. All catalysts were pretreated by heating in 10% hydrogen in helium ow to 873 K at 2 K/min and held at 873 K for 1 h in pure hydrogen.
Fig. 1 shows the isobutane conversion and dehy- drogenation selectivity (moles of isobutene produced per mole of isobutane reacted) for the Pt/Sn/silica and Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts. The Pt/Sn/silica catalyst exhi- bits an initial dehydrogenation selectivity of 44% at an isobutane conversion of 71%. After 20 h on-stream,the dehydrogenation selectivity over this Pt/Sn/silica catalyst increases to 88% as the isobutane conversion decreases to 44%. The Pt/Sn/K/silica catalyst exhibits an initial selectivity of 97% at an isobutane conversion of 44%. The isobutane conversion over this catalyst

11 decreases to 15% with no signicant change in selec- tivity after 15 h on-stream.
Fig. 2 shows the isobutane conversion and dehy- drogenation selectivity for the 1 : 2 Pt/Sn/K-L cata- lyst. These data show that the yield of isobutene (the product of conversion and selectivity) over the 1 : 2 Pt/ Sn/K-L catalyst is signicantly higher compared to the silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts. The Pt/Sn/K-L cata- lyst exhibits an initial isobutane dehydrogenation selectivity of 92% at an isobutane conversion of 61%. After 126 h on-stream, the isobutane conversion decreases to 46% and dehydrogenation selectivity increases to 99.8%.
Rates of isobutene production were determined over the Pt/K-L, 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L, and 1 : 2.4 Pt/ Sn/K-L catalysts at 873 K, 33.7 kPa isobutane pres- sure, and 67.6 kPa hydrogen pressure. These kinetic studies were performed with 80120 mesh catalyst particles packed between quartz glass plugs in a narrow quartz U-tube reactor. The isobutane conver- sion was maintained at <15% of the equilibrium value for the dehydrogenation reaction. All catalysts were pretreated by heating in 10% hydrogen in helium ow to 873 K at 2 K/min and held at 873 K for 1 h in pure hydrogen.Fig. 3 shows turnover frequencies for isobutene production, based on the number of sites determined by CO chemisorption over the fresh catalysts (see Table 2). The rate of isobutene production is consid- erably slower over Pt/K-L compared to the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts. Both Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactiva- tion during the rst 30 min, followed by a slower rate of deactivation.Kinetic studies were conducted to probe the effect of reduction time on the subsequent rate of isobutene production over the 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst. The catalyst was rst heated over 30 min from ambient temperature to 393 K in a owing mixture of 10% Fig. 1.

hydrogen in helium, held at 393 K for 1 h in a owing mixture of 10% hydrogen in helium, heated over 2 h from 393 K to 873 K in a owing mixture of 10% hydrogen in helium, and nally reduced for either 1 h or 16 h at 873 K in owing hydrogen. Fig. 4 shows that the nal reduction for 16 h leads to a signicantly lower initial rate of isobutane dehydrogenation, and the initial dehydrogenation rate following this treat- ment is similar to the dehydrogenation rate of the catalyst reduced for only 1 h followed by 16 h under reaction conditions. Thus, a signicant contribution to the deactivation of the catalyst reduced for 1 h is an increase in the extent of tin reduction and/or an increase in the metal-alloy particle size with time at 873 K. Analysis in the TEM indicates that signicant particle agglomeration occurs on catalysts reduced for 16 h at 873 K.
3.2. Deactivation studies at 873 K in the
presence of H2 Approximately 0.75 g of catalyst was loaded into a quartz sample cell which could be transferred between the TPO apparatus and the chemisorption apparatus without exposing the catalyst to air. The catalyst was rst reduced in hydrogen by heating overnight in a 10% hydrogen in helium ow to 873 K, held at 873 K for 1 h in hydrogen, and evacuated for 30 min at 673 K. The CO uptake was then measured at 300 K, after which the catalyst was heated to 873 K over 2 h in hydrogen and treated for 4 h under reaction conditions (33.7 kPa isobutane and 67.6 kPa hydrogen at 873 K). After purging the catalyst with helium at 673 K for 1 h to remove adsorbed H2, the catalyst was evacuated at 300 K for 2 h and the CO uptake mea- sured. Finally, the catalyst was heated to 873 K at 10 K/min in a 2% oxygen in helium ow to obtain the TPO spectrum. The catalysts were not re-used after the TPO, because sintering of the metal particles occurred after exposure to oxygen at high temperatures.
At the low space velocity of these experiments (WHSVof 0.1 h1), the isobutane conversions were initially equal to 75%, 65% and 55% for the 1 : 1.4 Pt/ Sn/K-L, Pt/K-L, and 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts,respectively, and these values decreased to 40% after 4 h on-stream. The CO uptakes before and after reaction are given in Table 2. An increase in the amount of Sn in the catalyst causes a decrease in the number of sites on the fresh catalyst, as seen in other studies [4,9,10]. The CO uptake is low on the Pt/ K-L catalyst, in comparison with previous studies of this catalyst system [11]. Therefore, CO uptakes were measured on a Pt/K-L catalyst that was reduced at 673,798 and 873 K for 1 h (temperature ramp of 2 K/min).
The corresponding CO uptakes are listed in Table 3.
Higher temperatures of reduction lead to a decrease in the CO uptake, which accounts for the low uptake on the fresh Pt/K-L catalyst. Similar results have been Table 2 CO uptake on fresh catalysts and after reaction at 873 K in

13 observed by Vaarkamp et al. [12]. After reaction, the CO uptake decreases on all catalysts; however, the relative decrease in the number of sites is smaller as the percentage of Sn in the catalyst increases.
The TPO spectra of the Pt/K-L, 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L and 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts after 4 h of reaction in isobutane and hydrogen at 873 K are shown in Fig. 5.
Peaks occur at 680 and 780 K for the Pt/K-L and 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts. The TPO spectrum of the 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst has a broad peak between 600 and 760 K. The amount of carbon on each catalyst is given in Table 4. Increasing the amount of Sn in the catalyst decreases the amount of carbon deposited under these reaction conditions.
Analyses of the catalysts by TEM indicate that sintering of the metal particles occurs after reaction at 873 K. Before the reaction, the L-zeolite-supported samples have very few particles visible on the external surface of the zeolite, and the particles that are visible are 1-2 nm in size (see Fig. 6). The 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst looks very similar to the 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst before and after reaction, and the results for the latter samples are shown in Fig. 6. This gure shows that, essentially, no particles are visible on the zeolite before reaction, while some particles, up to 5 nm in size, are visible after reaction. However, even though more particles are visible after reaction, the majority of the zeolite specimen (70%) does not show visible particles. The fresh Pt/K-L catalyst looks very similar to the 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 7 shows that particles are visible after reaction. Particles are visible on approximately half of the Pt/K-L catalyst specimen after reaction. The aver- age size of the particles, however, appears to be smaller (e.g. 1 nm) on the Pt/K-L catalyst after reac- tion compared to the Pt/Sn/K-L samples.
The uptake of isobutane was measured on the 1 : 2.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst before and after reaction. The adsorption of isobutane occurs primarily on the L- zeolite (the Pt/Sn/K-L sample contains a relatively Fig. 5.

small number of surface Pt sites), and this uptake is thus a measure of the accessible interior surface area of the catalyst. The change in uptake is negligible within the error of the experiment (see Table 5). This result is consistent with the observation that only a small amount of carbon is deposited on the catalyst during 4 h of reaction.
3.3. Deactivation studies at 798 K in the
absence of H2 Samples of catalysts (between 0.1 and 0.5 g) were loaded into a fritted quartz reactor, heated to 798 K overnight in a mixture of 10% hydrogen in helium ow, held at 798 K for 1 h in hydrogen, and then Fig. 6.

15 exposed to a ow of pure isobutane for 4 h. The catalyst was subsequently cooled to room temperature in helium and a TPO experiment was started using a ow of 2% oxygen in helium, and heating at 10 K/min to 898 K.
Measurable catalytic activity for isobutane conver- sion in the absence of hydrogen is maintained by all catalysts for reaction times of 4 h, except for the Pt/K- L-zeolite catalyst (see Fig. 8). The activity of the 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/L catalyst is lower than that of the Pt/ Sn/silica and Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts because the reac- tor contained only 3 mmol of sites compared to 8 and 5 mmols of sites, respectively, for the silica-supported catalysts. The activity of the Pt/K-L catalyst decreases to essentially zero within 30 min on-stream. For all catalysts except Pt/Sn/K/silica,the selectivity Fig. 7.

increases signicantly between 1 and 30 min on- stream, as shown in Fig. 8. This increase in selectivity may be caused by the formation of coke which decreases the size of the Pt ensembles, thus suppres- sing the isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions compared to the dehydrogenation reaction. Hydro- genolysis, isomerization and coking reactions require several adjacent Pt surface sites [4,13].
Fig. 9 shows the TPO spectra for the catalysts after 4 h reaction at 798 K in isobutane. The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K,while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K,while 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica has a peak around 680 K.
The peak at 360 K in the spectrum of the 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/ K-L catalyst is from weakly bound carbonaceous species on the surface, that can be removed by purging the catalyst with helium at 673 K for 1 h. Comparing Pt/silica with Pt/Sn/silica, and comparing Pt/K-L with Pt/Sn/K-L, it appears that Sn suppresses the extent of coke formation and it appears to alter the relative areas of the high and low temperature peaks (i.e. decreases the ratio of the 680 K peak to the 780 K peak). The addition of K to the Pt/Sn/silica catalyst signicantly decreases the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst.
The total carbon accumulated on the catalysts was determined from the area under the TPO spectra,where the baseline for integration was taken to be the CO2 evolution at 300 K. Table 4 lists the amounts of carbon deposited, based on catalyst mass and also based on the number of sites determined by CO chemisorption on the fresh catalysts. The order of decreasing amount of carbon per site is Pt=silica  1 : 1Pt=Sn=silica > 1 : 2:5Pt=Sn=KL > Pt=K  L > 1 : 1 : 3Pt=Sn=K=silica To obtain deactivation proles corresponding to the above reaction conditions, 0.005 g of catalyst was loaded into a quartz U-tube reactor with quartz wool. The deactivation proles for the 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/ K-L and Pt/K-L catalysts are compared in Fig. 10, at conditions for which the isobutane conversion was <10% of the equilibrium value. The Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates rapidly, whereas the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst has a high initial activity and deactivates over the rst 30 min on-stream, and then continues to deacti- vate at a slower rate. The deactivation behavior of the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst is typical for many catalysts [1416].Analyses of the catalysts by TEM before and after reaction in isobutane at 798 K indicate that little, if any, particle agglomeration occurs during the reaction.Essentially, no particles are visible on the L-zeolite- supported catalysts after reaction at 798 K. The silica- supported catalysts show particles with diameters from 25 nm on the support before and after reaction.Fig. 11 shows a micrograph from the 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/ Fig. 9.

17 silica catalyst, but this result is representative of the Pt/ silica and Pt/Sn/silica catalysts as well.
Isobutane uptake was measured on the Pt/K-L catalyst before and after reaction (see Table 5). After reaction, the uptake decreases by 75 mmol/g. This result indicates that carbon deposition occurred within the pores of the zeolite, and this pore blocking may account for the rapid decline with time in catalyst activity.
4. Discussion
A reaction temperature of 873 K is typical for commercial isobutane dehydrogenation processes to allow high yields of isobutene [2,1719]. At these conditions, the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst exhibits rela- tively poor dehydrogenation selectivities to isobutene,i.e. selectivities <90% (Fig. 1). However, the addition of potassium to this silica-supported catalyst improves the selectivity to >97%. The 1 : 2 Pt/Sn/K-L exhibits dehydrogenation selectivities >96% (Fig. 2), at iso- butane conversions near thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation reaction at the same space velocity, used with the silica-supported catalysts. The equilibrium conversion to isobutene is 58% at these reaction conditions. This catalyst continues to convert over 50% of the isobutane after 120 h. This is in contrast with the behavior of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts which deactivate rapidly on-stream (20 min cycle time) at temperatures >823 K [19]. In a related investigation [20], it was shown that increasing the amount of tin relative to platinum on K-L-zeolite above a 1 : 2.5 Pt/ Sn ratio, marginally increases the dehydrogenation selectivity, but at the expense of decreased catalyst activity and stability. Furthermore, the addition of excess potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L maintains the de- hydrogenation selectivity higher than 97% but leads to lower isobutane conversion.
The TPO results show that the addition of Sn improves the resistance of the K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts to the formation of coke during reaction at 873 K (Fig. 5 and Table 4). In addition, Table 2 shows that the higher coke content blocks a higher percen- tage of sites for CO adsorption on the Pt/K-L catalyst than on the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts. Although the pre- sence of Sn improves the resistance of the catalyst to coke formation, it may adversely affect the sintering of the catalyst, since larger particles were visible on the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts compared to the Pt/K-L catalyst after reaction at 873 K. In addition, Fig. 4 shows that the 1 : 1.4 Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst exhibited a similar rate of isobutene production after treatment in hydrogen for 16 h as a catalyst that was treated for 1 h in Fig. 11. TEM micrograph of 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica. 18

hydrogen and was subsequently exposed to hydrogen and isobutane for 16 h. Mo ssbauer spectroscopy has shown that Pt and Sn form alloy clusters in L-zeolite,but the majority of the Sn is present as Sn2 [5].
Studies on Pt/Sn/alumina [21,22] and Pt/Sn/NaY- zeolite [10] have shown that the proportion of tin in metallic particles increased with metal particle size.
Furthermore, Merlen et al. [22] have suggested that metallic tin cannot be stabilized in small particles.
Thus, the Sn2 in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst may slowly become reduced in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K and migrate to the Pt/Sn alloy particles, resulting in sur- face enrichment with metallic Sn and the loss of accessible Pt sites.
High yields of isobutene may be achieved at 798 K from the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the absence of feed hydrogen. The 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts show dehydrogenation selectivities higher than 95% under these reaction conditions (Fig. 8) and exhibit signicant activity.
In contrast, the Pt/K-L catalyst exhibits essentially zero activity in the absence of hydrogen. The origin of this behavior appears to be related to the formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen. The TEM results showed that little, if any, particle agglo- meration occurs during the reaction at 798 K in the absence of hydrogen. However, TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K com- pared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K.
Thus, the Sn and K additives improve the resistance of the supported Pt catalysts to deactivation by coking,and without these additives, in the absence of hydro- gen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates to nearly zero activity within several minutes on-stream.
Although the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst has an important effect on catalytic activity, it is also important to address the location of the carbon (e.g. whether carbon is on the active sites or on the support) [23]. It has been shown that the lower tem- perature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support [14,16,2325].
Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n- butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. In agreement with this behavior,we observed that the addition of Sn decreases the amount of carbon associated with Pt on both the silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts. In addition, the CO uptakes before and after reaction (see Table 2) indicate that fewer sites are lost on the catalyst as the Sn content is increased.
It has been suggested that Sn transports coke from the active sites to the support on Pt/Sn/alumina cata- lysts [14,26,27]. Lieske et al. [26] proposed a drain- off mechanism to explain the stabilizing effect of Sn on Pt/alumina catalysts. The presence of Sn decreases the size of the surface Pt ensembles so that the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon- metal bonds. Because the adsorbed species is attached less strongly to the metal surface, it is more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support. This effect is evident by the change in the ratio of the peak heights in the TPO spectra with the addition of Sn to the cata- lysts.
As well as decreasing the size of the surface Pt ensembles, K may also hinder the dehydrogenation of adsorbed species. It has been shown that the addition of K to Pt/Sn/silica decreases the CO uptake but increases the H2 uptake [6]. Barbier [28] has shown that the addition of K to alumina catalysts decreases the peak temperature in the TPO spectrum by 100 K,indicating that the carbon formed on the K-modied surface is more weakly bound. It is possible that the ion-exchanged potassium present within the L-zeolite may also help in suppressing the formation of highly dehydrogenated carbonaceous species. This behavior may at least partially explain why the peaks in the TPO spectrum are at lower temperatures for the Pt/K- L sample compared to the Pt/silica catalyst.
It has been shown in previous studies that Pt/L catalysts are resistant to coking during reactions with hydrocarbons such as n-hexane [11,29,30]. In our experiments, the Pt/K-L catalyst accumulates much less carbon than the Pt/silica catalyst, but the isobutane conversion over Pt/K-L decreases to essentially zero within several minutes on-stream. The L-zeolite sup- port has one-dimensional pores with diameters of
0.71 nm, and our isobutane adsorption studies (see
Table 5) indicate that some of the pores become blocked during isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt/K-L in the absence of hydrogen. Thus, the small amount of coke that forms on the Pt/K-L catalyst may

19 be present near the pore mouths, and thereby block Pt sites deeper within the pores of the L-zeolite from reaction with isobutane. In the aforementioned studies with n-hexane, the reaction was conducted in the presence of hydrogen, with hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon ratios between 5.5 and 8 [11,29,30]. In agreement with these previous studies, we nd that the Pt/K-L catalyst maintains its activity for isobutane conversion in the presence of hydrogen, although this catalyst is not selective for isobutene production. Hydrogen prob- ably removes the highly dehydrogenated carbon- aceous species from the surface as by-products (e.g. hydrogenolysis products), such that the selectivity of Pt/K-L to isobutene is low. On the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts,the deactivation proles were similar with and without hydrogen. This behavior indicates that the presence of Sn is sufcient to prevent the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to the for- mation of coke and other unwanted by-products.
5. Conclusions
Supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite pro- duces catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation that exhibit high dehydrogenation selectivity to isobutene at high isobutane conversions at 873 K in the presence of hydrogen and at 798 K with a pure isobutane feed.
At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/ K-L catalysts deactivate by coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles.
At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the major mode of deactivation for the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst is coking.
The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogena- tion catalyst. However, at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica exhibited signicantly lower isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts.
At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the addition of Sn and K to supported Pt catalysts improves the resistance of these catalysts to coking.
Both additives decrease the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby suppressing the hydrogenolysis,isomerization and coking reactions. The presence of Sn may also help to transport coke from the active sites to the support.
In the absence of hydrogen, the Pt/K-L catalyst deactivates to essentially zero activity within several minutes on-stream. Carbonaceous deposits block the pores and limit access to the active sites. In the presence of hydrogen, isobutane conversion is main- tained by the Pt/K-L catalyst but the selectivity to isobutene is low.
