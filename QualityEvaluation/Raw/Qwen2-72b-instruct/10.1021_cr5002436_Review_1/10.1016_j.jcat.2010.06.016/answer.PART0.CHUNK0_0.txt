1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys, which dilute Pt ensembles and inhibit the adsorption of product alkene, thus suppressing the formation of undesired products like methane. The addition of Ga to the catalyst also suppresses coke formation, leading to lower deactivation and higher stability. Recent developments in this area include the optimization of the Ga/Pt ratio to achieve peak activity and selectivity. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications in the production of light olefins.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是,它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性。这种催化剂在从乙烷和丙烷分别形成乙烯和丙烯方面显示出高活性和选择性。性能的增强归因于PtGa合金的形成,这种合金稀释了Pt集合,抑制了产物烯烃的吸附,从而抑制了不需要的产物如甲烷的形成。向催化剂中添加Ga还抑制了焦炭的形成,导致较低的失活和较高的稳定性。该领域的最新发展包括优化Ga/Pt比以实现峰值活性和选择性。这种催化剂的潜在优势包括高活性、选择性和稳定性,这对于工业应用中轻烯烃的生产至关重要。
