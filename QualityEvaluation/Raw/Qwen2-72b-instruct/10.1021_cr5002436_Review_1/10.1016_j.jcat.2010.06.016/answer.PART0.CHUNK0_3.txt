1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for alkene production, with the activity and selectivity peaking at a Ga/Pt ratio of 1.4 to 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature does not discuss the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的有效性。该催化剂显示出高活性和选择性，用于烯烃生产，活性和选择性在Ga/Pt比率为1.4到5.4时达到峰值。向进料中添加氢气会由于增强的氢辅助表面烷基物种脱氢而增加烯烃的形成速率。文献没有讨论金属氧化物基催化剂在该领域的工业应用，最新发展或潜在优势。
