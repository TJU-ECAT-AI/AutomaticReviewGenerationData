1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys, which dilute Pt ensembles and inhibit the adsorption of product alkene, thus suppressing product hydrogenolysis. The addition of hydrogen to the feed also increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. The literature does not discuss the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of other metal oxide-based catalysts in this context.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了一种新型Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的有效性。这种催化剂在从乙烷和丙烷形成乙烯和丙烯方面表现出高活性和选择性。性能的增强归因于PtGa合金的形成，这种合金稀释了Pt集合体并抑制了产物烯烃的吸附，从而抑制了产物氢解。向进料中添加氢气也会由于表面烷基物种的增强氢辅助脱氢而增加烯烃的形成速率。文献没有讨论其他金属氧化物基催化剂在这种背景下的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。
