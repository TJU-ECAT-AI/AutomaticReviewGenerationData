1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of a Pt-based catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, with a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurring at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4. Selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contributes to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了在新型Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物支撑上的Pt基催化剂对乙烷和丙烷脱氢的有效性。催化剂性能强烈依赖于支撑中的Ga含量，乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性峰值出现在Ga/Pt = 1.45.4。选择性是Ga/Pt的单调函数，在Ga/Pt = 5.4时接近100%。向进料中添加氢气导致H2/烷烃活性峰值。H2添加时脱氢速率的增加归因于H原子辅助的脱氢，这是在反应烷烃的解离吸附过程中形成的烷基物种。在H2添加的活性峰值之后，H2进料浓度的进一步增加导致烯烃氢化，从而降低了脱氢的净速率。然而，向进料中添加氢气对烯烃选择性的影响相对较小，烯烃选择性保持在近100%。Ga的存在也抑制了焦炭的形成。有趣的是，丙烷脱氢过程中形成的焦炭比乙烷脱氢过程少，而且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的相关性。因此，乙烷脱氢的失活程度低于丙烷脱氢，而前者的焦炭沉积量更高。
