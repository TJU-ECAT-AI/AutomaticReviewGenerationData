1.The literature does not provide a comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The literature does not discuss the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field.

1.文献没有提供用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂的比较。但是，它确实讨论了用于烷烃脱氢的新催化剂Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O的合成和表征。这种催化剂的有效性归因于Ga的存在，Ga与Pt相互作用形成PtGa合金。用于Pt双金属催化剂的支撑材料的组成影响金属颗粒对烧结的稳定性和在支撑材料本身上形成焦炭。文献没有讨论金属氧化物基催化剂在该领域的工业应用，最新发展或潜在优势。
