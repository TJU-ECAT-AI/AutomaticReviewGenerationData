1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The catalysts are prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O support, which is derived from a hydrotalcite-like precursor. The activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described in a separate study. The literature highlights the importance of support composition, particularly the Al content, in stabilizing the dispersion of Pt and influencing the formation of PtGa alloys at high reduction temperatures. The formation of PtGa alloys is proposed to occur through the reduction of Ga3+ cations by H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles, leading to the migration of Ga atoms into the supported Pt nanoparticles.

1.文献没有直接比较用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的基于贵金属（特别是铂）的催化剂和基于金属氧化物（如CrOx，镓，铟，钒，锌和钼氧化物）的催化剂。但是，它确实讨论了Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂用于将轻烷烃脱氢为烯烃的有效性。这些催化剂是通过将Pt纳米粒子分散到从类似水滑石的前驱体衍生的煅烧Mg(Ga)(Al)O载体上制备的。这些催化剂对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性，选择性和稳定性在另一项研究中进行了描述。文献强调了载体组成，特别是Al含量，在稳定Pt分散和影响在高温还原温度下形成PtGa合金方面的重要性。提出PtGa合金的形成是通过Pt粒子表面形成的H原子还原Ga3+离子，导致Ga原子迁移到支撑的Pt纳米粒子中。
