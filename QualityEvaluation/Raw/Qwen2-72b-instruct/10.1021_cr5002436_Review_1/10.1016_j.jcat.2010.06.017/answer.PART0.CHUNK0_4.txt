1.The literature does not provide a comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. These alloys enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene, increasing the rate of alkene formation and reducing the loss of hydrogen from the readsorbed alkene. The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The literature does not discuss the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in the field.

1.文献没有提供用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂之间的比较。但是，它确实讨论了用于烷烃脱氢的新催化剂Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O的合成和表征。这种催化剂的有效性归因于Ga的存在，Ga与Pt相互作用形成PtGa合金。这些合金增强了反应烷烃的解离吸附，并减弱了产物烯烃的吸附，增加了烯烃的形成速率，减少了从再吸附烯烃中失去的氢。用于Pt双金属催化剂的载体组成影响金属颗粒对烧结的稳定性和载体上焦炭的形成。文献没有讨论金属氧化物基催化剂在该领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。
