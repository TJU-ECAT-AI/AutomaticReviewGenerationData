1.The literature does not provide a comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does discuss the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness of this catalyst is attributed to the presence of Ga, which interacts with Pt to form PtGa alloys. The composition of the support, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, is also important, as it influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. The industrial application of this catalyst is in the production of light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, which are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemicals and polymers. Recent developments in this field include the preparation and evaluation of a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The potential advantages of this catalyst include high activity, selectivity, and stability for ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有提供用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂之间的比较。但是，它确实讨论了用于烷烃脱氢的新催化剂Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O的合成和表征。这种催化剂的有效性归因于Ga的存在，Ga与Pt相互作用形成PtGa合金。支撑材料Mg(Ga)(Al)O的组成也很重要，因为它影响金属颗粒对烧结的稳定性和在支撑材料本身上形成焦炭。这种催化剂的工业应用是在轻烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和n-丁烯的生产中，这些轻烯烃被广泛用作生产商品化学品和聚合物的构建块。该领域最近的发展包括一系列Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂的制备和评估，用于乙烷和丙烷的脱氢。这种催化剂的潜在优势包括对乙烷和丙烷脱氢具有高活性、选择性和稳定性。
