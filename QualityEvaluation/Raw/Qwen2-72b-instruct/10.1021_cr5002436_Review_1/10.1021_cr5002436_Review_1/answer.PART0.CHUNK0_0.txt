[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
[3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
[4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
[5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
[6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxides (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are commonly used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized in 1968 using an alumina-supported platinum catalyst. Later, UOP developed the Oleflex process for the production of butadiene and propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially CrOx, have been used industrially, and promising results have been achieved with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

1.在轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢中，通常使用两种主要类型的催化剂配方：基于贵金属和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。特别是铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂。由于铂对石蜡CH键具有优异的活化作用和对CC断裂的低活性，铂是研究最广泛的贵金属，也是唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属。1968年，第一种工业烷烃脱氢技术，Pacol工艺（UOP），使用氧化铝支持的铂催化剂首次商业化。后来，UOP开发了Oleflex工艺，最初用于生产丁二烯，后来扩展到丙烯。金属氧化物基催化剂，特别是CrOx，已在工业上使用，使用镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物取得了有希望的结果。
