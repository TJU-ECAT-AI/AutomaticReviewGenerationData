[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
[3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
[4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
[5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
[6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx), gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, are commonly used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized in 1968 using an alumina-supported platinum catalyst. Later, UOP developed the Oleflex process for the production of butadiene and propylene. Metal oxide-based catalysts, especially CrOx, have been used industrially and have shown promising results, with gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides also being tested successfully.

1.用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要催化剂配方是：基于贵金属的催化剂，特别是铂（Pt），以及基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如铬氧化物（CrOx）、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。铂是研究最广泛的贵金属，因其对石蜡CH键的优异活化能力和对CC断裂的低活性，成为唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属。第一个工业烷烃脱氢技术，Pacol工艺（UOP），于1968年首次商业化，使用了氧化铝支持的铂催化剂。后来，UOP开发了Oleflex工艺，最初用于丁二烯的生产，后来扩展到丙烯。基于金属氧化物的催化剂，尤其是CrOx，已在工业上使用，并显示出有希望的结果，镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物也已成功进行了测试。
