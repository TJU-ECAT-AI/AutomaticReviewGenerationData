[1] "two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."
[3] "promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides."
[4] "Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."
[5] "the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
[6] "UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene."

1.Noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are two main types of formulations used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal, while CrOx is the most prominent metal oxide due to its industrial use. Other metal oxides, such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also shown promising results. Platinum is the only noble metal used in commercial applications because of its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage. The Pacol process and the Oleflex process, both utilizing platinum-based catalysts, were commercialized by UOP for the production of light olefins.

1.用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要配方是基于贵金属和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。铂是最广泛研究的贵金属，而CrOx由于其工业应用是最突出的金属氧化物。其他金属氧化物，如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也显示出有希望的结果。铂是唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属，因为它对石蜡CH键的激活能力优越，对CC断裂的活性低。Pacol工艺和Oleflex工艺，都使用基于铂的催化剂，由UOP商业化用于生产轻烯烃。
