1.Noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types of formulations used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal, while chromium oxide (CrOx) is the most prominent metal oxide due to its industrial use. Other metal oxides, including gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have also shown promising results. Platinum is the only noble metal used in commercial applications because of its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity for CC cleavage. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized in 1968, and UOP later developed the Oleflex process for the production of butadiene and propylene.

1.用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要配方是基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。铂是最广泛研究的贵金属，而铬氧化物(CrOx)由于其工业应用是最突出的金属氧化物。其他金属氧化物，包括镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也显示出有希望的结果。铂是唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属，因为它对石蜡CH键具有优越的活化作用，对CC断裂的活性较低。第一个工业烷烃脱氢技术，Pacol工艺，于1968年商业化。UOP后来开发了Oleflex工艺，最初用于生产丁二烯，后来扩展到丙烯。
