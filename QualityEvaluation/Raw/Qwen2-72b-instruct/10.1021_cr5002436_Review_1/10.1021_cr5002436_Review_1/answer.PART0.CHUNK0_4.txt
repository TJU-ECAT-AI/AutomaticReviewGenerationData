1.Noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types of formulations used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Platinum is the most extensively studied noble metal in this context, due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity towards CC cleavage, making it the only noble metal used in commercial applications. Metal oxide-based catalysts, such as CrOx, have also been industrially used, with CrOx being the most prominent example. Other metal oxides, including gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, have shown promising results. The Pacol process, utilizing an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, was the first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology commercialized in 1968. Later, UOP developed the Oleflex process, initially for butadiene production and later extended to propylene.

1.用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要配方类型是基于贵金属的催化剂和基于金属氧化物的催化剂。铂是这种情况下研究最广泛的贵金属，由于其对石蜡CH键的优异激活和对CC断裂的低活性，使其成为唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属。基于金属氧化物的催化剂，如CrOx，也被工业使用，CrOx是最突出的例子。其他金属氧化物，包括镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，也显示出有希望的结果。1968年，第一个工业烷烃脱氢技术Pacol工艺（UOP）商业化，使用了氧化铝支持的铂催化剂。后来，UOP开发了Oleflex工艺，最初用于丁二烯生产，后来扩展到丙烯。
