Helsinki Uniersity of Technology, Department of Chemical Technology, Laboratory of Industrial Chemistry, P.O. Box 6100, FIN-02015 HUT, Espoo, Finland Received 19 January 1998; accepted 26 June 1998 Abstract The activity, selectivity and stability of RhrC catalysts prepared from nitrate precursor on three different active carbon supports was determined in ethene hydroformylation. The different active carbon supports yielded catalysts, which had
.
. different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427% after hydrogen reduction. The best activity and selectivity . in the formation of propanal was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst, presumably due to the better . metal dispersion and the presence of unreduced Rh sites. Furthermore, without any pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst exhibited even higher activity and better propanal yields than its hydrogen treated counterpart. Most likely, the active sites remained better dispersed in the absence of pretreatment than after hydrogen reduction, and it was the well-dispersed sites that were active in the formation of propanal. High temperature CO pretreatment partially blocked the catalyst surface with carbonaceous residues, which improved propanal selectivity, but suppressed the overall activity. Thus, the right choice of pretreatment appears to be a key factor in providing an active and selective catalyst for heterogeneous hydroformylation. It should also be noted that the catalysts lost 1030% of the metal deposited on the support during 24 h on stream. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

174 hydrogen adsorption, to promote strong or mul- tiple adsorption of CO and to inhibit dissocia- w x tive CO adsorption 14 . These special charac- teristics of active carbon are also important for hydroformylation, which is governed by molec- ular reaction of CO.
On supported catalysts, the reaction sequence involving CO insertion and subsequent hydro- genation has been found to be much faster than the competing reaction route consisting of CO dissociation and hydrogenation of the surface w x carbon species 2 . However, when considering the nature of the active sites, the literature data is controversial. In some studies, the CO inser- tion selectivity is related exclusively to the lin- 0 w x early adsorbed CO on isolated Rh sites 15,16 .
Other studies show that reaction rate and selec- tivity for hydroformylation is increased in the presence of Rhq sites, and that the reduced Rh crystallites are highly active for the hydrogena- w x tion of ethene 17 . Moreover, the hydroformy- lation of ethene is regarded as structure sensi- tive, and the hydrogenation of ethene structure w x insensitive 15 . Accordingly, the insertion se- lectivity has been enhanced by partial blockage w x 18 or selective poisoning of the active sites w x 19,20 . In regard to the more precise size of the w x active site, Arakawa et al. 21 have reported that a Rh particle size below approximately 3
nm is advantageous for hydroformylation the . number of edge and corner atoms is increased ,and ethane formation is at a maximum with a Rh particle size of around 4 nm. Thus, the results clearly show that high dispersion, or small particle size, is of the utmost importance for hydroformylation activity.
In the case of Rh on active carbon, the particle size of the active metal and the selectiv- ity of the catalyst, have been greatly influenced by the choice of the support as shown in our previous work concerning methanol hydrocar- w x bonylation 22 . Our previous studies have also indicated that the particle size can be affected w x by the pretreatment of the catalyst 23 . For
. example, the decarbonylation of Rh CO r 4 12 SiO in a CO atmosphere instead of hydrogen 2 appeared to decrease the particle size. Conse- quently, the selectivity of the catalyst to oxy- genates in CO hydrogenation was significantly increased. A similar positive effect of CO treat- ment on propanal selectivity has also been no- ticed on RhrC catalyst in ethene hydroformyla- w x tion 11 . Therefore, both the characteristics of the support and the method of pretreatment of the supported precursor might have a profound effect on the activity and selectivity of the RhrC catalyst in a structure sensitive reaction,such as ethene hydroformylation.
In this work, the performance of the RhrC catalysts was studied in the gas phase hydro- formylation of ethene, with the hope of enhanc- ing the heterogeneous functionality of the cata- lysts already observed in the liquid phase hydro- w x formylation of 1-hexene 24 . The aim was to elucidate the effect of the active carbon support on the catalytic activity of rhodium in connec- tion with different pretreatment conditions. In addition, we determined the stability of the cata- lysts since experimental evidence regarding the stability of the heterogeneous catalysts in hydro- formylation under flow conditions is still scarce w x 25 .
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Three different activated carbon supports were used for the preparation of 5 wt.% RhrC . catalysts: C N stands for peat based Norit Rox .
0.8, C T for wood based Japanese Takeda Shi-
. rasagi, and C C for coconut shell based acti- vated carbon from Johnson Matthey. The sup- ports were impregnated with rhodium nitrate as a catalyst precursor. The catalysts were calci- nated under nitrogen flow at 4008C for 3 h. The details of the preparation are presented in more w x detail elsewhere 26 . ( )

2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The catalysts were characterised by TPR, H 2 and CO chemisorption, XPS and TEM. The metal contents of the catalysts were determined before and after the reaction by AAS. The details of the preparation and characterisation of the activated carbon supported RhrC catalysts w x have already been reported in detail 26 , except for support analysis, SEM and TPR, which will be presented in this paper.
The potassium contents of the supports were determined by flame AAS using a Varian Spec- trAA-600 with O rC H -flame. Prior to analy- 2 2 2 sis, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia in closed vessels. Particle morphology was studied
with a scanning electron microscope SEM, Leo .

X-ray spectroscopy system EDX, Noran Voy- . ager for chemical analysis. The catalyst parti- cles were prepared for analysis by placing them
. on SEM stubs aluminium with two sided car- bon tape.

H rAr mixture 30 cm rmin . The consump- 2 tion of hydrogen was monitored with a thermal
. conductivity detector TCD . In addition, the gas stream at the outlet was analysed using a Balzers MSC-200 Thermocube mass spectrome-
. ter MS .
The extent of reduction was determined from the hydrogen consumption during the TPR by assuming that rhodium is present as Rh3q in
0 the calcined catalyst Rh O q3H Rh q 2 3 2 . 3H O , and that the H rRh ratio during reduc- 2 2 tion remains constant over the temperature range studied. The extent of reduction determined in this way might not be the absolute value, but it allows a comparison of the reducibility of the RhrC catalysts. The TCD curve was fitted by 4 Gaussian curves to obtain the area under each curve, and thereby the hydrogen consumption was related to each peak.
2.3. Ethene hydroformylation
The ethene hydroformylation was carried out in an automated fixed bed tubular reactor i.d.s12 mm, pocket for the thermocouples:. o.d.s6 mm in the gas phase at 0.5 MPa and 1738C, using a 1:2:2:2 molar ratio of Ar:CO:
H :C H
and GHSV of approximately 800 2 2 4
900rh. The catalyst, 1 or 0.5 g approximately
3.
2.6 or 1.3 cm , was diluted with glass beads in
a 1:1 volume ratio. In general, isothermal condi- tions were maintained, i.e., the control point temperatures inside the pocket for the thermo- couples, which was placed in the catalyst bed typically remained within "0.58C in respect to the setpoint value, and the vertical temperature gradient of the catalyst bed was within "18C in respect to the setpoint value. However, in some . cases, the initial activity of the RhrC C and .
RhrC T catalysts was too high to maintain isothermal conditions; the automatic cooling system of the reactor forced the reaction tem- perature to the setpoint value, and the vertical temperature gradient of the catalyst bed was within "48C in respect to the setpoint value.
Therefore, we repeated some of the experiments with 0.5 g of catalyst, using the same GHSV as previously.
The product analysis was carried out on-line using two HP 5890 Gas Chromatographs one equipped with a DB-1 from J&W Scientific and PoraplotQ from Hewlett Packard, and the other one with a packed column filled with activated carbon coated with 2% squalane. The response w x factors published by Dietz 27 were used in quantitative determinations.
The data was recorded for 24 h and the steady-state conver- sion and selectivities were calculated as an aver- age of last 56 h. Conversion, selectivities and yields were calculated based on the ethene con- sumed. ( )

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterisations
The hydrogen consumption in TPR measure- ments, together with water and methane forma- tion, were determined as a function of tempera- ture for RhrC catalysts in order to estimate the reducibility of the catalysts. The results are presented in Figs. 13. The hydrogen consump- tion during TPR below 2508C was mainly due
. to the formation of water Fig. 2 , whereas at temperatures higher than 2508C, the formation
. of methane predominated Fig. 3 . Since the determination of water and methane was not quantitative, the extents of reduction were eval- uated from hydrogen consumption. Since it is only the hydrogen consumption for the forma- tion of water that should be accounted for when considering the reduction of the Rh species, the estimation of the extents of reduction had to be limited to 2508C.
The first peak maximum for hydrogen con- sumption was at 85908C, equivalent to an extent of reduction of 29, 12 and 8% for . . .
RhrC C , RhrC N and RhrC T , respectively

Thus, the reduction of RhrC commenced at temperatures clearly be- low those used for the hydroformylation reac- tion in this work. The XPS results presented in Table 1 will be discussed later in this paper in connection with activity results.
The results shown in Table 1 also indicate that the total amount of hydrogen consumed . was much higher for RhrC C than for Fig. 1. TPR spectra of RhrC catalysts. ( )

RhrC N or RhrC T , and the formation of methane and water was also correspondingly higher. Since only trace amounts of methane and water were observed during the TPR of the . . plain support C C support , the high methane formation was due to the rhodium catalysed support gasification in accordance with the re- w x sults of Tomita and Tamai 28 . The question remains, however, as to why the gasification was significantly more pronounced on the . . .
RhrC C than on RhrC N or RhrC T .

The activity of the catalysts varied with time on stream; it decreased more sharply during the first 4 h on stream, after which the conversion decreased further by 14 units depending on the support and pretreatment in question.

versions of ethene to all products averaged . from conversions at TOSs1824 h were 28,. . 24 and 12% for the RhrC T , RhrC C and .

RhrC N catalysts, respectively Fig. 4 .
Some changes in the product distribution were observed especially during the first hour on
. stream. The high initial TOSs1015 min ethane yield decreased sharply during the first hour and, simultaneously, the propanal yield increased from almost zero to the steady-state . level, as illustrated in Fig. 5 for RhrC T . In the steady state, the main products formed were ethane and propanal. In addition, minor amounts of side products were observed. The side prod- ucts were mainly C aldols, i.e., condensation 6 products of two propanal molecules, such as 2-methyl-2-pentenal and 2-methyl-1-pentanal,but small amounts of propanol and 3-pentanone,and in some cases propylformate and propylpro- pionate, were also detected.
In addition to the changes in the activity for ethane and propanal formation during the first hours on stream, there were differences between the catalysts depending on the support. The best selectivity with regard to the desired product,propanal, i.e., the best activity for CO insertion and subsequent hydrogenation, was obtained . with the RhrC C catalyst. The propanalr . ethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodi- .

RhrC T catalysts. Thus, the outstanding per- . . formance of RhrC C compared to RhrC N . and RhrC T in terms of selectivity merits a more detailed discussion to determine the origin of its superiority.
Previously, the reaction rate for hydroformy-
. lation formation of propanal has been pro- posed to be faster on isolated Rhq sites than on 0 w x Rh sites 17 , i.e., both the valency and the size of the rhodium species on the different activated carbon supports are important for this structure sensitive reaction. In regard to the extent of reduction, the TPR results indicated that the . reducibility of RhrC T was lower compared to . .
RhrC C or RhrC N . In addition, a previous study has indicated that the near-surface extent
. . of reduction XPS was 62% for RhrC T , 78% . . for RhrC C and 94% for RhrC N after re- duction at 4008C for 1 h under H rN flow 2 2 w x 22 . The results agree with the previous studies w x 17 by confirming that the partly reduced cata-
. .. lysts Rhr C and RhrC T exhibit the highest yields of propanal.
However,the high . propanalrethene ratio observed for RhrC C cannot be explained by the extent of reduction.
As described above, the size of the metal particles is of utmost importance for the hydro- formylation activity. The determination of parti- cle size for RhrC catalysts is, however, am- biguous because hydrogen treatments induce ag- w x glomeration of rhodium sites 22,30 . Thus, the

RhrC T , the Rh species were evenly dis- tributed with an average particle size of 27 nm.
Together, the XPS, TEM and chemisorption results indicate that after hydrogen reduction,. . both RhrC C and RhrC T have sites favourable for hydroformylation, i.e., partially reduced rhodium sites which are small enough in size. As a result, both the catalysts exhibit high yields in hydroformylation, but the signifi- . cantly higher selectivity of RhrC C towards propanal still remains unexplained. The low ac- . tivity of RhrC N in hydroformylation is in agreement with the characterisations: the very . small particles present on RhrC N were fully reduced, being thereby less active in hydro- formylation and more active in hydrogenation.
Moreover, the considerably lower overall activ- . ity of RhrC N is explained by the low total
. hydrogen uptake Table 2 .
Under the reaction conditions, surface recon- struction occurs and thus both the extent of reduction and particle size may be significantly altered during the course of the reaction. Indeed,the reactivity results also lend support to this view since the activity and selectivity were drastically altered during the first hours of the reaction. Therefore, the used catalysts were studied by SEM to see the effect of different pretreatments on the particle size of the metal.
Unfortunately, the particle size distributions of the catalysts could not be determined accurately enough, although the resolution of the equip- ment on hand was goodthe sizes of the small-
. est particles -10 nm were too small to be detected. Nevertheless, another very interesting finding was made: the SEM determinations sug- gested that KCl particles were present on the .
RhrC C catalyst, but not on the other two catalysts. Perhaps, unintentional KCl promotion was the cause of the superior selectivitya possibility deserving more detailed considera- tion.
Only a few studies of potassium promotion in w x connection with hydroformylation exist 31 .
Fortunately, some relevant studies are available w in connection with synthesis gas reaction 32 x w x 35 . For example, Matsuzaki et al. 34 have reported that potassium promotion with CorSiO resulted in increased C oxygenates 2 2 selectivity due to depression of the hydrogena- tion ability of the catalyst. In accordance, the . hydrogenation ability of the RhrC C catalyst was clearly lower than that of the other two w x catalysts. Another relevant study 35 reports that potassium oxide suppressed CO dissocia- tion, and thereby promoted the formation of methanol and C oxygenates in synthesis gas 2 reaction on RhrSiO catalystcharacteristics 2 beneficial for hydroformylation in which CO reacts in its molecular form. Also, Kq counter- cation increased propanal selectivity on silica- w

181 line earth oxides promoted the formation of significant amounts of propanoic acid and C6 condensates in ethene hydroformylation on
. w x Co CO rSiO catalysts 36,37 , and potassium 2 cations promoted the formation of large amount of acetic acid in CO hydrogenation on RhrSiO2 w x 38 . Thus, since in our studies propanoic acid was not formed, the amounts of C oxygenates 6 . were only slightly increased on RhrC C cata- lyst, and the conversion level of the catalyst was not suppressed, the effect of potassium was most probably not profound. However, it is possible that the potassium present slightly im- . proved propanal yields on RhrC C compared to the other supports.
When the potassium contents of the plain supports and distilled water used in the prepara- tion of the catalysts were determined, the potas- sium contents were 6.6, 0.3 and 0.02 mgrg for . . .
C C , C N
and C T supports, respectively.
Moreover, the potassium content of the distilled water was 0.1 mgrl. Thus, the potassium found in the coconut supported catalysts was most probably transferred from the support matrix onto the catalyst surface during catalyst prepara-
. tion wet steps or high temperature treatments w x 39 .
3.3. The performance of RhrC in the absence
of pretreatment The RhrC catalysts were also tested in the absence of pretreatment in order to shed light on the debate as to whether Rh0 or Rhq is the active site for hydroformylation. The number of Rhq sites would be expected to be higher with- out any reductive pretreatment, due to lower extents of reduction. Furthermore, the hydrogen reduction has been shown to induce agglomera- w x tion of rhodium on carbon 22 and, therefore,higher dispersion might be another benefit ob- tained by omitting the pretreatment. .
As expected, the RhrC C catalyst was more active than its hydrogen reduced counterpart
. when the pretreatment was omitted see Fig. 4 .
The propanal yield increased from 12 to 14%,which was the best propanal yield achieved with our catalysts, although the propanalrethane ra- tio changed slightly from 1.1 to 1.0. This in- creased activity may in part be explained by better dispersion since Rh catalysed gasification of the carbon support might have been responsi- ble for the agglomeration of Rh during hydro- . gen pretreatment in the case of RhrC C , as
discussed in connection with TPR results see . also Fig. 3 . However, the higher activity was probably also influenced by the extent of reduc- tion, which remains lower in the absence of
reduction than after hydrogen treatment see . also Table 1 . Based on the TPR results, it seems apparent that part of the rhodium species were probably reduced to metal during the first hours under synthesis gas flow. Moreover, the results from hydrogen chemisorption deter- mined after reduction at 1758C also support the idea of higher dispersion without high-tempera-
. ture treatment Table 2 . The irreversible hydro- gen uptake is 1.45 and 1.55 cm3rg for low- cat temperature and high-temperature treated .
RhrC C , respectively, and thus, the dispersion of the low-temperature treated catalyst corrected by the extent of reduction would be clearly higher than that of the high-temperature treated
. catalyst Ds27% due to the lower extent of reduction of the catalyst. Thus, the high activity . of RhrC C catalyst without pretreatment is explained by the better dispersed metal, and the existence of unreduced Rh sites active in hydro- formylation. .
In contrast to the performance of RhrC C ,. . the overall activity of RhrC T and RhrC N catalysts decreased slightly when the pretreat- . ment was omitted. For RhrC T , the decrease . in conversion was 2.5% units and for RhrC N it was 4.5% units. The propanalrethane ratios
. remained the same for both pres0.7 . Per- . . haps, in the case of RhrC N and RhrC T , the omission of the pretreatment had a less restric- tive effect on agglomeration since much less hydrogasification was observed on these two catalysts, i.e., the formation of methane during .
TPR was clearly lower than on RhrC C . In ( )
T.A. Kainulainen et al.rJournal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 140 1999 173184
182 regard to the extent of reduction, it seems ap- parent that the extent of reduction was lower after omitting the pretreatment than after hydro- gen reduction. Thus, one would expect higher reactivity, but nevertheless the hydroformyla- . . tion yields of RhrC T and RhrC N were not improved.
The changes in the product distribution with time on stream followed a similar trend to that observed in the experiments with hydrogen re- duction; the ethane formation predominated in the beginning. The decrease in overall activity was due to a decrease in ethane conversion, i.e.,apparently, the amount of active sites for ethane formation decreased during the reaction. Consis- w x tently, Mori et al. 40 have reported that the active site for ethane production might be dif- ferent from that for propanal production.
3.4. The performance of RhrC after CO pre-
treatment The performance of the RhrC was also stud- ied with CO pretreatment, which has previously been found to significantly enhance the oxy- genate yield on RhrSiO in CO hydrogenation 2 w x via partial blockage of the active sites 23 .
Such a partial blockage effect should also be beneficial for hydroformylation catalysts. Oth- ers have claimed that CO treatment provides w x high dispersion 41 another desired feature for hydroformylation.
.
For the CO treated catalysts 4008C, 1 h , the
. activity was significantly lower only 5% than
. for the ones after hydrogen reduction 1228%
. see Fig. 4 . Thus, the high temperature treat- ment with CO probably blocked the catalyst surface with coke as observed previously for w x RhrSiO 23 . Due to this major decrease in 2 activity, the CO pretreatment was also carried
. out at lower temperature 1758C , and indeed the conversion decrease was only 5% for .
RhrC T . Evidently, the choice of temperature is critical when considering CO pretreatment of the catalyst surface.
As a result of the high temperature CO treat- ment,the selectivity towards propanal in- creased, and this increase was highest on the .
RhrC C catalyst, which was also initially the most selective towards propanal. Therefore, the high temperature treatment with CO probably partially blocked the catalyst surface with coke,and thereby increased the amount of CO inser- tion sites compared to hydrogenation sites. Af- ter low temperature pretreatment, however, the aldehyde promotion was almost negligible. Ap- parently, the pretreatment temperature was so low that the carbonaceous deposits formed were reactive, and no permanent blockage of the w x catalyst surface occurred 42 .
3.5. Stability of the catalysts
Our previous studies with 1-hexene hydro- formylation showed that metal losses occurred w x during the liquid-phase reaction 24 , and we assumed that the stability of the catalysts would be improved under less severe reaction condi- tions. Indeed, under gas phase conditions, the . metal losses were less than 10% for RhrC N ,. . whereas for RhrC T and RhrC C , they were
. . 2030% see Table 3 . Thus, the RhrC C and .
RhrC T catalysts active in the formation of propanal lost more metal than the less active Table 3 The metal contents of the fresh RhrC catalysts and the Rh losses determined from the used catalysts after ethene hydroformylation reaction Catalyst Pretreatment Fresh catalyst, Rh loss

RhrC N . Consistently, under the reaction con- ditions, the supported Rh species might form volatile carbonyls which are transported away from the support with the product flow. To confirm this assumption, we performed a test on .
RhrC C in the absence of CO ethene hydro- . genation : the losses were only 8%. Thus, most of the losses are due to the action of CO on Rh.
4. Conclusions
The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate the effect of support characteristics and pretreat- ments on hydroformylation activity.
After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had dif-
. ferent extents of reduction 6294% and dis-
. persion 815% , but all catalysts were never- theless active in hydroformylation. The best se- lectivity towards the desired product, propanal,was obtained with the coconut shell based .
RhrC C catalyst. The propanalrethane molar . ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surpris- ingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh catalyst under these conditionsa result due to the characteristics of the active carbon support and, possibly, to the unintentional promotion by KCl.
In the absence of pretreatment, the perfor- . mance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart. Most likely, the rhodium . species on the RhrC C catalyst remained more well dispersed in the absence of pretreatment than in conjunction with hydrogen reduction since the undesired Rh catalysed hydrogasifica- . tion of the C C support was eliminated. In . addition, the extent of reduction for RhrC C was presumably lower after omitting the pre- treatment, i.e., the number of unreduced Rh sites favourable for hydroformylation was in- creased. However, the activity of the other two catalysts decreased slightly without pretreatment a result due partly to the less profound hydro- . gasification effect in connection with RhrC T . and RhrC N .

produced no benefits. Thus, the right choice of pretreatment appears to be a key factor in providing an active and selective cata- lyst for heterogeneous hydroformylation.
In summary, the support characterististics and the different pretreatments had an influence on the dispersion and the extent of reduction, and thereby on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Highly dispersed catalysts were essen- tial for hydroformylation activity, and small amount of unreduced Rh was favourable for propanal formation. A more detailed interpreta- tion of the interrelation between the character- istics and reactivity would require in situ char- acterisation techniques since the catalyst surface reconstructs during reaction. In addition, marked improvements are required in the catalyst com-
. position to avoid the losses 1030% of the active species during the reaction.
