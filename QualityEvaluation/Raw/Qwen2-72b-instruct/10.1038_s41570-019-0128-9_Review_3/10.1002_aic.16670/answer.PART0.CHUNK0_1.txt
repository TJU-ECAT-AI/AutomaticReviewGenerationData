1.The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed activity in the CO2-ODH reaction with propane, achieving steady-state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% for C3H6 and 65% for CO. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was more active in the DRP reaction, with a CO2 conversion that was 2.5 times higher than that of the Co3Pd1/CeO2 catalyst. Both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 catalysts were effective for DRP, showing higher activity and stability than their Pt and Pd counterparts combined with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barriers for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1 catalysts were similar, at 126 kJmol-1 and 119 kJmol-1, respectively. The TGA weight loss for Ni3Pt1 was reported to be 8%, while the Co3Pt1 catalyst lost 4% under similar conditions. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was found to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, similar to the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst. The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts showed a preference for propylene formation but had low performance due to deactivation. The Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst. The DRP Co3Ni1 catalyst, on the other hand, consisted of metallic Ni and Co under reaction conditions.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出活性，使用丙烷时，CO2和C3H8的稳态转化率分别达到2.6%和1.1%，C3H6和CO的选择性分别为32%和65%。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在DRP反应中更为活跃，CO2转化率比Co3Pd1/CeO2催化剂高2.5倍。Ni3Pt1和Ni3Pd1催化剂在DRP反应中表现出高效，比Pt和Pd与Fe3和Co3结合的催化剂具有更高的活性和稳定性。Co3Pt1和Ni3Pt1催化剂在重整路线上的表观活化能分别为126 kJmol-1和119 kJmol-1，数值相近。Ni3Pt1的TGA重量损失报告为8%，而Co3Pt1催化剂在类似条件下损失了4%。Fe3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下被发现由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，与DRP Fe1Ni3催化剂相似。Fe-Co双金属催化剂显示出倾向于形成丙烯，但由于失活而性能较低。Fe3Co1催化剂主要由金属Co和氧化Fe组成，但Fe氧化的程度低于Fe3Ni1催化剂。相比之下，DRP Co3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和Co组成。
