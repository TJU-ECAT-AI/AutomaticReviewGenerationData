[7] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
[8] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

1.The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed activity in the CO2-ODH reaction with propane, achieving steady-state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% for C3H6 and 65% for CO. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was more active in the DRP reaction, with a conversion of CO2 that was 2.5 times higher than that of the Co3Pd1/CeO2 catalyst. Both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 catalysts were effective for DRP, showing higher activity and stability compared to their Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while the previously reported value for Ni3Pt1 was 119 kJmol-1. The TGA weight loss of Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and the Co3Pt1 catalyst lost 4%. The Fe1Ni3 catalyst, like Fe3Ni1, consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. DFT calculations showed that in the presence of oxygen from the dissociation of CO2, Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface with a greater amount of Ni than Fe, metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced, potentially dampening the catalytic effect observed with oxidized Fe and promoting activity in favor of the dry reforming reaction.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出活性，实现了2.6%的CO2和1.1%的C3H8的稳态转化率，C3H6的选择性为32%，CO的选择性为65%。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在DRP反应中更为活跃，CO2的转化率比Co3Pd1/CeO2催化剂高2.5倍。Ni3Pt1和Ni3Pd1催化剂在DRP反应中表现出高效，与Fe3和Co3的Pt和Pd对应物相比，显示出更高的活性和稳定性。Co3Pt1催化剂上重整路线的表观活化能为126 kJmol-1，而Ni3Pt1的先前报告值为119 kJmol-1。Ni3Pt1的TGA重量损失为8%，Co3Pt1催化剂的损失为4%。Fe1Ni3催化剂，与Fe3Ni1一样，在反应条件下由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成。Fe3Ni1催化剂先前被确定由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成。DFT计算表明，在CO2解离产生的氧气存在下，Fe由于Fe-O键比Ni-O键更强，会向表面迁移。然而，在Ni含量高于Fe的表面上，金属Ni颗粒会更加突出，这可能会削弱观察到的氧化Fe的催化效果，并促进有利于干重整反应的活性。
