1.The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed activity in the CO2-ODH reaction with propane, achieving steady-state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% for C3H6 and 65% for CO. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and stability in the DRP reaction, with a conversion of CO2 that was 2.5 times higher than that of the Co3Pd1/CeO2 catalyst. Both Ni3Pt1/CeO2 and Ni3Pd1/CeO2 catalysts were found to be effective for the DRP reaction, exhibiting higher activity and stability compared to their Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 it was 119 kJmol-1. The TGA weight loss for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 was reported to be 8%, and for Co3Pt1/CeO2, it was 4%. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, which was also the case for the DRP Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalyst. The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts showed a preference for forming propylene but had low performance due to deactivation. The Fe3Co1/CeO2 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst. The DRP Co3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, consisted of metallic Ni and metallic Co under reaction conditions.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出活性，使用丙烷时，CO2和C3H8的稳态转化率分别达到2.6%和1.1%，C3H6和CO的选择性分别为32%和65%。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在DRP反应中表现出更高的活性和稳定性，CO2的转化率是Co3Pd1/CeO2催化剂的2.5倍。Ni3Pt1/CeO2和Ni3Pd1/CeO2催化剂被发现对DRP反应有效，与含有Fe3和Co3的Pt和Pd对应物相比，表现出更高的活性和稳定性。Co3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在DRP反应中的表观活化能为126 kJmol-1，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂为119 kJmol-1。Ni3Pt1/CeO2的TGA重量损失报告为8%，Co3Pt1/CeO2为4%。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在反应条件下被发现由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，DRP Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂也是如此。Fe-Co双金属催化剂显示出形成丙烯的倾向，但由于失活，性能较低。Fe3Co1/CeO2催化剂主要由金属Co和氧化Fe组成，但Fe的氧化程度低于Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂。另一方面，DRP Co3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和金属Co组成。
