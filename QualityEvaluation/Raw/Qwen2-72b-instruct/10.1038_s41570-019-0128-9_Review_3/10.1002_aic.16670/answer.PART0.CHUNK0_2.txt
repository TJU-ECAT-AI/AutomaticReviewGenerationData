1.The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed a steady state conversion of 1.1% for propane (C3H8) and 2.6% for carbon dioxide (CO2), with a selectivity of 32% for propylene (C3H6) and 65% for carbon monoxide (CO). The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, demonstrated higher activity and stability for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) reaction compared to its Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while for Ni3Pt1 it was 119 kJmol-1. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) weight loss for Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and for Co3Pt1 it was 4%. Both Fe3Ni1 and Fe1Ni3 catalysts consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions. The Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst. The CoxNiy catalysts, composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were active and selective for the DRP pathway.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在稳态下对丙烷(C3H8)的转化率为1.1%，对二氧化碳(CO2)的转化率为2.6%，对丙烯(C3H6)的选择性为32%，对一氧化碳(CO)的选择性为65%。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在丙烷干重整(DRP)反应中表现出比其Pt和Pd与Fe3和Co3的对应物更高的活性和稳定性。Co3Pt1催化剂上重整途径的表观活化能为126 kJmol-1，而Ni3Pt1为119 kJmol-1。Ni3Pt1的热重分析(TGA)重量损失为8%，Co3Pt1为4%。Fe3Ni1和Fe1Ni3催化剂在反应条件下均由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成。Fe3Co1催化剂主要由金属Co和氧化Fe组成，但Fe的氧化程度低于Fe3Ni1催化剂。在反应条件下由金属Co和Ni组成的CoxNiy催化剂对DRP途径具有活性和选择性。
