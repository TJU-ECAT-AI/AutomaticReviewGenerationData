The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 it was 119 kJmol-1. The TGA weight loss for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 was reported to be 8%, and for Co3Pt1/CeO2, it was 4%. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, which was also the case for the DRP Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalyst. The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts showed a preference for forming propylene but had low performance due to deactivation. The Fe3Co1/CeO2 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst.
