[1] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion,respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."
[2] "Compared to the Co3Pt1 catalyst, the conversion of CO2 over the Co3Pd1 catalyst was 2.5 times lower."

[6] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
[7] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
[8] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."
[9] "However, on a surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced."
[10] "This could essentially dampen the catalytic effect observed with oxidized Fe, thereby changing the active site and promoting activity in favor of the dry reforming reaction, similar to those described previously for the reactions of CO2 with ethane."

1.The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed activity in the CO2-ODH reaction with propane, achieving steady-state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% for C3H6 and 65% for CO. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, was more active in the DRP reaction, with a conversion of CO2 that was 2.5 times higher than that of the Co3Pd1/CeO2 catalyst. Both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 catalysts were effective for DRP, showing higher activity and stability compared to their Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while for Ni3Pt1 it was 119 kJmol-1. The TGA weight loss for Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and for Co3Pt1 it was 4%. Both Fe3Ni1 and Fe1Ni3 catalysts consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions. DFT calculations suggested that in the presence of oxygen from the dissociation of CO2, Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface with a greater amount of Ni than Fe, metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced, potentially dampening the catalytic effect observed with oxidized Fe and promoting activity in favor of the dry reforming reaction.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出活性，使用丙烷时，CO2和C3H8的稳态转化率分别为2.6%和1.1%，C3H6和CO的选择性分别为32%和65%。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在DRP反应中更为活跃，CO2的转化率是Co3Pd1/CeO2催化剂的2.5倍。Ni3Pt1和Ni3Pd1催化剂在DRP反应中表现出高效，与Fe3和Co3的Pt和Pd对应物相比，活性和稳定性更高。Co3Pt1催化剂上DRP途径的表观活化能为126 kJmol-1，而Ni3Pt1为119 kJmol-1。Ni3Pt1的TGA重量损失为8%，Co3Pt1为4%。Fe3Ni1和Fe1Ni3催化剂在反应条件下均包含金属Ni和氧化Fe。DFT计算表明，在CO2解离产生的氧气存在下，由于Fe-O键比Ni-O键更强，Fe会向表面富集。然而，在Ni含量高于Fe的表面上，金属Ni颗粒会更加突出，这可能削弱氧化Fe观察到的催化效应，从而促进DRP反应的活性。
