[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
[3] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
[4] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
[5] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
[6] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[7] "Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scission and the formation of C3H6."

1.The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have been identified as promising for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows 58% selectivity for C3H6 with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is highly active for DRP with 96% selectivity for CO. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is evidenced by the higher C3H6 yield compared to monometallic catalysts. Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. DFT studies suggest that Fe3Ni(111) favors CH scission over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, facilitating selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, whereas Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, leading to rapid formation of oxygenated intermediates in reforming.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别被鉴定为在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中与丙烷反应的有前途的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2显示出58%的C3H6选择性，稳定性良好，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中高度活跃，CO选择性为96%。Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe和Ni之间的协同作用通过与单金属催化剂相比更高的C3H6产量得到证明。Ni3Pt/CeO2具有金属Pt，而Fe3Ni/CeO2包括金属Ni和氧化Fe。DFT研究提出，Fe3Ni(111)倾向于CH裂解而不是CC裂解，与Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)不同。Fe3Ni(111)强烈结合氧气，促进选择性CH裂解和C3H6的形成，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)适度结合氧气，导致快速形成重整中的氧合中间体。
