[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
[5] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[6] "Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scission and the formation of C3H6."
[7] "The combined approach of flow reactor experiments (including kinetic measurements), in situ and ex situ characterization, and DFT calculations allows chemists to identify and understand the intrinsic activity of heterogeneous catalysts for the CO2-ODH of C3H8."

1.The steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propene with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for carbon monoxide. In situ XANES measurements revealed that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic platinum, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic nickel and oxidized iron. DFT calculations showed that Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) energetically favor CH scission over CC scission, with opposite behavior predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). The binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, but all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately strongly, allowing it to react rapidly with hydrocarbons to form oxygenated intermediates in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, facilitating selective CH scission and the formation of propene. The combined experimental and theoretical approach allows chemists to understand the intrinsic activity of heterogeneous catalysts for CO2-ODH of propane.

1.稳态流动反应确定Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别为丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP的有前途的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2对丙烯表现出58%的选择性，稳定性良好，而Ni3Pt/CeO2是一种高活性的DRP催化剂，对一氧化碳的选择性为96%。原位XANES测量显示，Ni3Pt/CeO2具有金属铂，而Fe3Ni/CeO2包含金属镍和氧化铁。DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)在能量上更倾向于CH裂解而不是CC裂解，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)则预测有相反的行为。Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)上所有中间体的结合构型相似，但所有中间体与Fe3Ni(111)表面的结合更强。Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)与氧的结合强度适中，使其能够迅速与碳氢化合物反应，形成重整中的氧化中间体。相反，Fe3Ni(111)与氧的结合强度大，有助于选择性CH裂解和丙烯的形成。结合实验和理论方法使化学家能够理解异质催化剂在丙烷CO2-ODH中的内在活性。
