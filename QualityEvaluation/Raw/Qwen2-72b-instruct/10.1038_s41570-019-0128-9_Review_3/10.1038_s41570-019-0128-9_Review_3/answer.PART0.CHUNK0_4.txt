[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
[5] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[6] "Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scission and the formation of C3H6."

1.稳态流动反应确定Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别是C3H8的CO2-ODH和DRP的有希望的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2表现出58%的C3H6选择性并具有良好的稳定性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2是一种具有96% CO选择性的高活性DRP催化剂。根据原位XANES测量，Ni3Pt/CeO2具有Pt0，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2都包含Ni0。Fe3Ni/CeO2中的Fe以氧化形式存在。DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)在能量上更倾向于CH裂解而不是CC裂解，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)则预测有相反的行为。所有中间体在Fe3Ni(111)表面上的结合更牢固。Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)仅适度强烈地结合*O，从而促进*OCxHy的形成，这是重整中的氧化中间体。Fe3Ni(111)强烈结合*O，从而促进选择性的CH裂解和C3H6的形成。
