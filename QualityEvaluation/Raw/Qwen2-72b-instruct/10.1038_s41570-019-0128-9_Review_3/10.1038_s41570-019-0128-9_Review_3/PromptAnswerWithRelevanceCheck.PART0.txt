[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
[3] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
[4] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
[5] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
[6] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[7] "Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scission and the formation of C3H6."

1.The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have been identified as promising for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows 58% selectivity for C3H6 with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is highly active for DRP with 96% selectivity for CO. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is evidenced by the higher C3H6 yield compared to monometallic catalysts. Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. DFT studies suggest that Fe3Ni(111) favors CH scission over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, facilitating selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, whereas Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, leading to rapid formation of oxygenated intermediates in reforming.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别被鉴定为在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中与丙烷反应的有前途的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2显示出58%的C3H6选择性，稳定性良好，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中高度活跃，CO选择性为96%。Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe和Ni之间的协同作用通过与单金属催化剂相比更高的C3H6产量得到证明。Ni3Pt/CeO2具有金属Pt，而Fe3Ni/CeO2包括金属Ni和氧化Fe。DFT研究提出，Fe3Ni(111)倾向于CH裂解而不是CC裂解，与Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)不同。Fe3Ni(111)强烈结合氧气，促进选择性CH裂解和C3H6的形成，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)适度结合氧气，导致快速形成重整中的氧合中间体。

1.The steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propene with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for carbon monoxide. In situ XANES measurements revealed that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic platinum, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic nickel and oxidized iron. DFT calculations showed that Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) energetically favor CH scission over CC scission, with opposite behavior predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). The binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, but all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately strongly, allowing it to react rapidly with hydrocarbons to form oxygenated intermediates in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, facilitating selective CH scission and the formation of propene. The combined experimental and theoretical approach allows chemists to understand the intrinsic activity of heterogeneous catalysts for CO2-ODH of propane.

1.稳态流动反应确定Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别为丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP的有前途的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2对丙烯表现出58%的选择性，稳定性良好，而Ni3Pt/CeO2是一种高活性的DRP催化剂，对一氧化碳的选择性为96%。原位XANES测量显示，Ni3Pt/CeO2具有金属铂，而Fe3Ni/CeO2包含金属镍和氧化铁。DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)在能量上更倾向于CH裂解而不是CC裂解，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)则预测有相反的行为。Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)上所有中间体的结合构型相似，但所有中间体与Fe3Ni(111)表面的结合更强。Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)与氧的结合强度适中，使其能够迅速与碳氢化合物反应，形成重整中的氧化中间体。相反，Fe3Ni(111)与氧的结合强度大，有助于选择性CH裂解和丙烯的形成。结合实验和理论方法使化学家能够理解异质催化剂在丙烷CO2-ODH中的内在活性。
