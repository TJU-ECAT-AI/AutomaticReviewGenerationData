This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal- hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory process of humans and animals. The Zn-enzyme Carbonic Anhy- drase (CA) can accelerate the reaction of hydration-dehydration of CO2, facilitating, thus, CO2 up-take at cellular level and elimina- tion in lungs from where it is expulsed [86]. It is now recognized that this enzymatic process implies the nucleophilic attack of a Zn2+-bound hydroxyl group at free CO2, which is held in place by hydrogen bonds within the pocket of the active site of the enzyme.
The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial inter- est as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides. A variety of LnMAOR com- plexes have been investigated and also tested as catalysts in LnMAOH  CO2 ! LnMAOCOOH 26 LnMAOR  CO2 ! LnMAOCOOR 27 synthetic chemistry and co-polymerization processes [8789]. The transition state of such reaction can be represented as in Fig. 12 and implies the interaction of the electrophilic C of CO2 with the oxygen of the OR group [90,91]. Preliminary coordination of CO2 to the metal center is not necessary in this class of reactions.
The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido com- plexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis LnMANR2  CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2 28 of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92]. Also this pro- cess does not require, as a preliminary step, the coordination of
CO2. In fact, the reaction can proceed via attack of free CO2 to the
nitrogen atom of metalamido-complex [93]. However, because of the aptitude of metalamides and metalcarbamates to hydrolyze,it is possible also an amine-catalyzed mechanism summarized by reactions (29) and (30) [94]. Trace amounts of amine can be fortu- itously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds as a result of M(NMe2)n hydrolysis due to adventitious water. Under the working conditions (CO2 in excess relative to amine), the free amine can interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2- NCO2H, which reacts as shown in Eq. (30).

30 According to the above mechanism the formation of the metal carbamate complex should be better regarded as a ligand substitu- tion, rather than a true insertion process. This reaction pathway has been largely exploited from the synthetic point of view for the preparation of a great number of metal carbamate adducts (Eq. (31)) [34,35].
LnMAX  CO2  R2NH ! LnMO2CNR2  HX 31 (X = H, Cl, alkyl, OR, ClO4, etc.) The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAC bond can occur according to two different modes, which are usually designated as normal and abnormal mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96].
The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands. The normal insertion mode affords metal-formates (E = H) or, more generally,metal-carboxylates (E = C), while the abnormal mode generates a metalla-carboxylic acid (E = H) or a metalla-ester (E = C). Such insertion reactions are important steps in stoichiometric or cat- alytic processes leading to the synthesis of carboxylic acids and carboxylate esters.
To date, very little is known about the abnormal insertion path for which only a few claims exist [54,95,96]. The MACO2H species

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 is proposed [97] to be present and active in several processes implying MH-species and CO2, but a clear-cut demonstration of CO2 insertion into the MAH bond of a transition metal complex to afford M-CO2H is not found in the literature. Conversely, MACO2H species have been generated by chemical or electro- chemical protonation of MACO2 complexes, either g2-C,O or g1-C.
The reactivity of MAH/CO2 systems has reached high levels of attention because of its relevance to reactions that may have industrial interest such as the hydrogenation of CO2 to afford for- mic acid (Eq. (32)) and the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to other C1 or C1+ molecules.
CO2g  H2g ! HCOOHl DG  33 kJ mol 1 32 What is the role of CO2 coordination in this insertion process (Scheme 5, (a); E@H) has been matter of several theoretical and experimental studies. Both paths represented in Scheme 6 are possible, depending on the nature of the metal center [98100].
The nature of the reaction medium may also play a key role in influ- encing the mechanistic pathway [100]. However, the whole matter still waits for a full rationalization.
The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by tran- sition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years. The interest toward such a process is mainly due to the potential of formic acid as hydrogen-carrier, as the two reactions,(i) carbon dioxide hydrogenation using molecular dihydrogen and (ii) decomposition of formic acid into the starting carbon diox- ide and dihydrogen, give a quasi-CO2-neutral cycle. Currently,worldwide production of formic acid, obtained from the combina- tion of methanol and carbon monoxide with a strong base, is in the order of 0.8 Mt/y and is used in the textile industry, cleaning and as a preservative. Demand could increase markedly due to the devel- opment of efficient formic acid dehydrogenation catalysts that could find widespread application within the context of a hydrogen economy [101].
A limitation of the approach is the unfavorable thermodynamics of reaction (32). However, the formation of formic acid is more favorable in a condensed medium such as water (Eq. (33), DG = 4 kJ mol1), where the CO2/H2CO3/HCO3 equilibrium as well as the second deprotonation to CO3 2 must be taken into account,or if a base is used that produces formate salts instead of free formic acid, (Eq. (34), DG = 35 kJ mol1) [102].
Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3 or CO3 2 rather than CO2.
CO2aq  H2aq ! HCO 2aq  H aq 33 H2aq  CO2aq  Baq ! HCO 2aqBH aq 34 Another drawback is the kinetic stability of the intermediate hydrido-formate species LnMH(OCHO): breaking of the MAO and MAH bonds can represent the real kinetic barrier to the process.
Overcoming the above kinetic and thermodynamic barriers requires the use of a shuttle. Either Group 1 metal cations are used for the extraction of the formate moiety, or amines which are able to extract H. This has for long time prevented the exploita- tion of carbon dioxide hydrogenation as a catalytic direct route to free HCO2H despite catalysts have been developed that have a high TON (several millions) and TOF [103,104] toward the salt. In fact,either the ammonium- or the Group 1 metal-formate that are produced need treatment with inorganic acid (such as H2SO4) for the production of the free acid. Such acid treatment produces equimolar (relative to HCO2H) amounts of waste inorganic salts.
Very recent reports have opened interesting perspectives about the possible exploitation of the direct synthesis of free formic acid from CO2 and H2 in acidic media, without the need of any bases,amines or buffers. Lawrenczy has shown that it is possible to pro- duce free formic acid by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by carry- ing out the reaction in water or DMSO, without using any additive,in the presence of Ru-catalysts (RuCl2(1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaada mantane) and other related ligands) [102].This finding represents a breakthrough in this field and can open the way to an exploita- tion of the reaction.
Oxidative coupling reactions of CO2 with unsaturated molecules X@Y (Scheme 7), such as olefins, dienes, cumulenes, alkynes,g2-aryne, nitroso- or diaza-compounds and hetero-olefins (imines,carbodiimides, azadienes or aldehydes) [7,54,73,105113], are key steps toward the functionalization of the above substrates.
These reactions generate a new CAY bond (Y = C, N, O), and open an alternative route, in addition to the insertion reactions,to the incorporation of the heterocumulene into a variety of new carboxylated products (acids, esters, lactones, pyrones, etc.), often characterized by complex molecular structures largely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.
The coupling reaction is promoted by a low-oxidation state transition metal center (Ni, Mo, Fe, Mn, Pd, Rh, Pt, etc.), which undergoes oxidation, and affords a five-membered metallahetero- cycle, as shown in Scheme 7(a). Remarkably, in the known exam- ples, the oxygen of carbon dioxide more than the C-atom binds to the metal (Scheme 7(b)).
The relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes is another open issue, which has been addressed in detail only in a few cases.
In principle, the above couplings can take place through one of the routes (i)(iii) below:(i) the substrate reacts with coordinated CO2 (pathway a); LnM + CO2

However, the mechanistic details are not known. The reaction is believed to be initiated by the nucleophilic addition of IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 to CO2 (O(3)C(2)O(4)), with the resultant more nucleophilic oxygen (O(3)) binding a second CO2 molecule (O(2)C(1)O(1)) through C (1). Cyclization via IrAO(1) bond formation affords the product.
Pathway (b) has been documented experimentally for the oxidative coupling CO2/propionaldehyde [112]
(X@C,
Y@O;
Scheme 7) and CO2/isoprene (X@Y@C; Scheme 7) [113] at a Ni(0) center for which the activation parameters have been measured (DH = 43  6 kJ/mol and DS = 129  19 J/mol K [112]; DH = 25  7 kJ/mol; DS = 184  24 J/mol K [113], respectively).
Several examples of oxidative coupling CO2/olefin or CO2/alkyne have been reported [7,105,106,114,115]. To date, the hypothesis that coordinated CO2 might react with free alkene/alkyne to gener- ate a metalla-lactone has not found sound experimental support.
For instance, despite Ni(0)-complexes are very effective in promot- ing the oxidative coupling of CO2/olefin, Aresta et al. found that Ni (CO2)(PCy3)2, in the solid state, did not react with gaseous ethene even after three hours at room temperature. In solution, a substitu- tion reaction occurred easily with formation of Ni(PCy3)2(C2H4) [7,74,116], showing that ethene is more tightly bound to Ni (PCy3)2 than CO2. Accordingly, earlier DFT calculations carried out for the systems ethene/CO2 [117] and alkyne/CO2 [118,119] in the presence of Ni(0) bearing N-donor ligands, ruled out that the oxidative coupling of CO2 with the above substrates (alkene/ alkyne) at Ni(0) may involve the interaction of a NiACO2 complex with the unsaturated substrate used (Eq. (35b)) or proceed through an associative mechanism involving the intermediate formation of a mixed substrate-carbon dioxide Ni-complex (Eq. (36c)). The calculations indicate that the coupling reaction involves the activa- tion of the olefin by coordination at the metal center and the sub- sequent reaction of the activated substrate with an incoming CO2 molecule (Eq. (36b)), as shown by previous experiments [116].
However, suitably changing the nature of ancillary ligands or metal center may open new mechanistic pathways and, for instance, shift the mechanism of olefin/CO2 oxidative coupling toward pathway (c) (Eq. (36c)). For instance, a theoretical work supports that oxidative coupling ethene-CO2 at nickel centers bear- ing bidentate phosphorous ligands can proceed through sequential coordination of ethene and CO2 to Ni with formation of an ethene CO2Ni-complex LNi(C2H4)(CO2), wherein, however, CO2 is only weakly bound to Ni [120]. Pathway (c) was originally postulated by Carmona for the reaction of trans-M(C2H4)2(PMe3)4 with
CO2
affording the binuclear hydrido-acrylate complex l-(CH2@CHCOO)2[HM(C2H4)(PMe3)2]2 (Scheme 9) [121].
DFT calculations (carried out for M@Mo) have confirmed the consistency of the mechanism illustrated in Scheme 9 [122].
Coordination of CO2 molecule to the metal center with formation of the CO2-bis-ethene complex Mo(C2H4)2(CO2)(PMe3)3 is a neces- sary step to achieve the CO2-alkene coupling, because the formation of the new CAC bond is promoted by a simultaneous metal ? CO2 and metal ? C2H4 electron donation mechanism. The formation of the metalla-lactone species is, thermodynamically, allowed and the activation barrier has been estimated to be 11 kcal/mol. The five-membered metallacycle converts into a metal-hydride species through an exothermic b-hydrogen transfer step showing a calcu- lated energy barrier of 10 kcal/mol. The hydrido-acrylate monomer is already well below the energy of the reactants, but further stabi- lization is achieved through the dimerization process.
The mechanism of ethene carboxylation at a Mo center has been investigated also experimentally [123], following the conversion of trans-(triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2 (triphos = (Ph2PCH2CH2)2PPh) and
CO2
into the bridging acrylate hydride complex,[(triphos) MoA(H)(OC(O)CH@CH2)]2 (Scheme 10). The observation of the intermediate complex (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) on the path to CAC bond formation (Scheme 10) provides the first experimental evidence that simultaneous coordination of both ethene and car- bon dioxide at a metal center is a prerequisite for coupling the two unsaturates. This behavior is somewhat different from what described to occur at nickel centers. It has been suggested that the requirement of precoordination of both CO2 and olefin, while being less stringent for late transition metal centers like Ni, may be more likely for early transition metal centers.
However, at present, generalizations may be rash. Knowledge in this field is still lacunose and further studies are required to fully elucidate, for a given M/X@Y/CO2 system, the role of the metal cen- ter and ancillary ligands in marking the mechanistic pathway of the coupling reaction.
3. Conversion of CO2 into chemicals
3.1. CO2 as a C1-synthon for the synthesis of intermediates and fine
chemicals The incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic substrates tells in a clear way the huge potential of the cumulene as C1-synthon for the synthesis of fine and commodity chemicals [36,124130].
These reactions allow to build up new CACO2AH, CACO2AC, EACO2 (E = N, O) moieties and lead to the direct carboxylation of the organic substrate with formation of new products such as car- boxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates, and carbonates. Such synthetic approach is of great importance from the industrial point of view as the target products have a large market of the order of several Mt/y. Moreover, the exploitation of such synthetic method- ology would allow the implementation of more direct or safer syn- thetic routes in place of those on-stream that do not respond to the energy- or atom-economy principles or make use of toxic and harmful starting materials such as phosgene, opening thus, and intriguing new perspectives of development of a more sustainable chemistry. In fact, with respect to processes on stream, the utiliza- tion of CO2 for the synthesis of carboxylated compounds bears several benefits such as: reduce the production of waste, recycle carbon, and make less use of solvents if supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is used as solvent and reagent. Because of the more direct syn- thetic approach, there may also be a lower energy consumption.
Such benefits may be accurately evaluated by using the LCA IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3

One can foresee that in general, the energetics of the carboxyla- tion processes will be acceptable, the energy required for CO2 con- version being contributed by the co-reagent, which is an electron- rich species. This is the case of carboxylation reactions in which the carbon atom maintains the formal +4 oxidation state, as in carba- mation or carbonation reactions (Fig. 1). To such processes, those bearing to the formation of carboxylates RCOOH(R) (e.g., acids,esters, and lactones), in which the C-atom has an oxidation state of +3, can be added. Also these reactions may be thermodynami- cally feasible but, at least in a few cases, they may show some ther- modynamic or kinetic constraints.
In the following sections special attention will be devoted to compounds such as carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates,isocyanates, ureas, carbonates, due to their industrial importance.
3.1.1. Oxidative coupling with olefins: synthesis of acrylic acids and
acrylates As previously emphasized (Section 2.4.3), CO2 and olefins can react in the presence of a suitable metal center and form a metallacyclo-carboxylate (A) (Scheme 11). Such species have been isolated and characterized in a number of cases [54,73,110].
Scheme 11 shows two possible ways through which, in principle,(A) may further react, once formed. Formation of b-lactone, which may form from by reductive elimination, has never been observed experimentally. On the other hand, the metalla-lactone may generate, through a b-H shift reaction, a metal-hydrido-acrylate species (B).
Species like (B), which have been isolated (M = Mo, W) and fully characterized [121,123], have drawn great attention for their potential as precursors of acrylic acids RHC = CH2C(O)OH which,in principle, might be generated by reductive elimination. Acrylic acid is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid and is a building block for hundreds consumer products. The global acrylic acid market was valued at $11006.6 million in 2013, and it is estimated to reach $18824.0 million by 2020, growing at a rate of 7.6% during the forecast period (from 2014 to 2020) [132]. The global con- sumption of acrylic acid is anticipated to reach 8169.0 kt by
2020. Acrylic acid, CH2@CHCO2H, is used in a number of industrial
applications. The primary use of acrylic acid is in the production of

It is also used in oil treatment chemicals, detergent intermedi- ates, water treatment chemicals, and water absorbent polyacrylic acid polymers. It is currently manufactured at an industrial scale by two-stage oxidation of propene (Eq. (37)), a byproduct of hydro- carbon cracking and naphtha refining.

38 The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alterna- tive as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants are found in the target product.
Hoberg [133], in the early 1980s, first reported the (sub)stoi- chiometric formation of cinnamic acid, PhCH@CH2C(O)OH, from styrene and CO2, in the presence of Ni(cod)2 and DBU. Since then,the catalytic synthesis of acrylic acids by direct coupling of olefins with CO2 has greatly attracted the interest of chemists. However, to date, this goal still remains unaccomplished. In fact, going back to Scheme 11, either (A) or (B) may be stable species which prevent spontaneous release of acrylic acid. Theoretical and/or experimen- tal studies [122,123] support (see Section
2.4.3)
that the conversion of the five-membered metallacycle (A) into the metal- hydride species (B) at a Mo or W center is a both thermodynami- cally and kinetically accessible step, but the hydrido-acrylate monomer (B) does not eliminate acrylic acid, probably because of the barrier of the cleavage of the MAH and MAO bonds. On the other hand, the body of experimental evidences suggests that in Ni(0) promoted CO2-olefin coupling reactions the metallacycle structure (A) (Scheme 11) is a thermodynamic sink, as a nickela- lactone was usually found to be the final product. A more recent attempt to liberate acrylic acid from a nickelalactone was based on the use of a basic phosphane, such as 1,2-bis(diphenylpho sphino)methane (dppm). However, a molecular rearrangement took place bearing the cleavage of PAC bonds and the formation of stable acrylato-complexes [134]. Aresta and coworkers have first modeled using DFT the reaction of ethene with CO2 over L2Ni and shown that the formation of the acrylic acid occurs in three main steps passing through the facile formation of the pentaatomic met- allacycle ring, which is in a well of energy that prevents on Ni a facile last step, i.e. the b-H shift. Moreover the elimination of acrylic acid has also a barrier [117]. Later on, Buntine and cowork- ers [135] have investigated the reactivity of Ni(cod)(DBU)2 using
DFT. The calculations showed again three main steps for the pro-
cess: exothermic formation (17.2 kJ/mol) of the five-membered nickelacycle by oxidative coupling;endothermic b-H shift (+21.3 kJ/mol) resulting in a nickel-hydrido-acrylate species;endergonic reductive elimination of acrylic acid;(see also Scheme 11). The three steps exhibited substantial energy barriers (respectively: 121.8 kJ/mol; 147.4 kJ/mol; 104.1 kJ/mol), but in the opinion of the authors, not so large that would prohibit the overall catalytic process. Thermodynamic in addition to kinetic constraints may also prevent the overall reaction from taking place at a significant extent, in accordance with the solvation-corrected Gibbs free energy of the coupling reaction in question, which was calculated to be unfavorable by +42.7 kJ/mol [135]. In this regard, it may be of interest to note that acrylic acid has been reported to react with Ni(cod)2 (1 equiv) in the presence of PCy3 (1 equiv) to give the nickela-lactone species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2-
C(O)O) [136].
The reductive elimination of acrylic acid from a hydrido-acrylate metal complex closely resembles the previously discussed elimina- tion of formic acid from hydrido-formate metal complexes LnM(H)
O2CH. In the latter case, the elimination process is facilitated by
using an appropriate shuttle of the formate anion (amine or Group 1 metal cations). The use of K+(Na+) shuttle has been inves- tigated by Limback [137,138] who has reported the first catalytic (also limited to a few cycles) formation of CH2@CHCOOM (M = K, Na) by using Ni(0) catalysts in presence of MOH (Scheme 11). A variation to this approach has been proposed by using excess Zn-powder to reduce Ni [139]. This process uses more than 2e per mol of acrylic acid (considering the loss of Zn used in excess),being less effective than the electrochemical generation of acry- lates carried out in the 1993s [140]. The role of Lewis acids has been also investigated [141,142], and the activity of Pd systems has been explored [143].
Recent advances have opened new perspectives in this research area. The topic of coupling ethene-CO2 has recently been faced fol- lowing a new synthetic approach aimed at avoiding the contempo- rary formation of MAH and MAO bonds and driving the system toward the formation of a metallorganic species of the type
MCH2CH2CO2R,
which easily eliminates the acrylato ester CH2@CHACO2R via a b-H shift with generation of a MAH species.
With the use of a Pd catalyst it has been shown that the elimina- tion of the acrylate ester is an easy reaction and the catalytic for- mation of such ester was described, however limited to a few cycles [144]. The correctness of such strategy is further supported by a few recent results which describe the formation of methyl acrylate by methylation of nickela-lactones with MeI [145,146].
The latter results merit attention as they confirm that alkyl esters of acrylic acids can be released more easily than the corresponding acids from nickela-lactones.
A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an olefin with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would it be possible to insert an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of (A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on? nCO2  nRCH@CHR ! ACHRACHRACOOnA 39 Such alternate insertion of olefin and CO2 has not been experi- mentally documented so far. It is useful to recall that alkynes are able to insert a second alkyne in the skeleton of the product of oxidative coupling of CO2 and the alkyne (Scheme 12 and 18; vide infra 3.1.4). The insertion does not give an ester linkage as it occurs on the MAC bond rather than on the MAO bond. The product of coupling is then eliminated as a pyrone. The coupling of the olefin with CO2 is more difficult than the coupling of the alkyne. Such reaction may have a large industrial interest and is worth investi- gating also if it is foreseeable that a perfect alternate insertion will not be easily reached, and the insertion of CO2 will be statistical and will not reach the level of insertion of CO as in the case of ethene/CO.
3.1.2. Synthesis of other carboxylic acids by oxidative coupling CO2 and
olefins The formation of a terminal carboxylic moiety CACO2 is achieved through a variety of routes such as oxidation of hydrocar- bons or aldehydes (obtained from olefins by hydroformylation),base catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols, carbonylation reac- tions often coupled with H2O addition (Koch reaction; Reppe chemistry), oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozonolysis or using

In some cases the synthetic methods are poorly selective or not quantitative, and in other cases they may imply multistep procedures with production of wastes and loss of carbon [116].
In this ambit the development of direct catalytic carboxylation of organic substrates would be of great value and applicative interest.
As previously noted, unsaturated substrates such as olefins,alkynes, [54,73,105,106,109,110,147,148] allenes [106,149] and conjugated dienes [73,105,106,118,119,150155] can react with CO2 in the presence of a suitable metal center in a low oxidation state through an oxidative coupling reaction, which provides an entry into a variety of metal-carboxylated species. Although most of such reactions at the moment are stoichiometric, they can play a significant role from the synthetic point of view as they are direct and clean routes to functionalized unsaturated carboxylic acids or alkyl esters, which can be released stoichiometrically upon simple protonolysis or acidolysis in the presence of alcohols.
3.1.2.1. Functionalization of alkynes, allenes and conjugated dienes.
Ni(0) is very effective in promoting the oxidative coupling of alkynes or allenes with CO2. Scheme 12 shows the formation of carboxylic acids produced by hydrolysis of the metallacycle. Such route uses catalysis for the coupling of the unsaturated substrate with CO2,but the metallacycle does not undergo spontaneous elimination,as already seen with acrylates. Acidolysis is necessary for recover- ing the carboxylic acid. Such syntheses have been achieved in the 1993s by electrocatalysis [156,157], which again is not catalytic as sacrificial electrodes were used and the carboxylated product was recovered as Mg-salt, in general. Making such processes cat- alytic would be of great importance.
Stoichiometric carboxylation of conjugated dienes with CO2 has been carried out in the presence of both late and early transition metal complexes. Depending on the nature of the metal center,ancillary ligands, diene substrate, and, more generally, working conditions, the carboxylation reaction may evolve in different ways and afford metal-carboxylic products implying 1:2 or 1:1 or 2:1 CO2/1,3-diene coupling, which are useful synthones for further reactions with electrophiles. For instance, in the presence of mon- odentate P-ligands, Ni(0) promotes the CO2/1,3-diene coupling in a
1:2 ratio to yield a Ni(II)-C9-carboxylate.
This behavior reflects the well recognized ability of Ni(0)- complexes bearing labile phosphane ligands to promote olefin oligomerization. In thes carboxylation reactions the dimerization of the diene to form a bis-allyl-C8 chain is followed by CO2 inser- tion into a Ni-allyl r-bond to afford Ni(II)-carboxylates, which may undergo further rearrangement reactions. CO2/diene coupling in a
1:1
ratio to give g3-allyl-C5-carboxylate Ni-complexes (Scheme 12) has been shown to be promoted in the presence of P- or N-chelating ligands [106,154]. Although g3-coordination of the allyl moiety is thermodynamically more stable compared to the g1-bonding mode, an g3g1 rearrangement of the oxo-p- allyl intermediate formed by diene-CO2 oxidative coupling is also possible and can be envisaged to account for the formation of a,x-dicarboxylate complexes, which have been reported in a few cases (Scheme 12; M = Fe [151], Zr [152], Ni [153]). Remarkably,only 1,4- and no 1,2-dicarboxylation have been observed. More recently, this stoichiometric chemistry has received new impulse [158160] and has, for instance, been applied to the synthesis of highly functionalized carboxylic acids, such as a-methylene-c-hydr oxy carboxylic acids [158] and their derivatives, or exploited for the preparation of b-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives [159].
The synthetic valence of the reactions described above is out of discussion, but their stoichiometric character may represent a lim- itation to their exploitation. The moment being they can be applied on a small scale or for the synthesis of high added value chemicals of complex structure. The stoichiometric nature of these processes

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 can be related with the thermodynamic and/or kinetic stability of metalla-lactones or Cn-carboxylate metal-complexes intermediate products as discussed above (Scheme 12).
Driving catalytically the carboxylation of the above substrates is not an easy task. This goal may be achieved through a judicious choice of the metal center, the ancillary ligands and the experi- mental conditions. For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn- over (TON = 29) [153]. Unfortunately, to date, this remains a rare example of such an approach.
Nowadays, new synthetic strategies have given new impulse to the research in this area opening new perspectives in the use of the heterocumulene as carboxylating agent of unsaturated organic substrates. These approaches exploit the reactivity of a suitable co-reagent able to reduce back the catalyst from Ni(II) to Ni(0).
At the end the catalytic center can be recycled, but a reduced form of a metal (Zn, Al) is oxidized. Such approach may have sense if the catalyst is a precious metal, less with Ni. The fact that another metal is in any case oxidized in stoichiometric amount leaves doubts about the correctness of using the term catalytic in such applications, and leaves on such reaction the label of trans metalations or syntheses assisted by metals.
Alkyl- or aryl-zinc reagents, acting as alkylating(arylating)/trans metalating agents, have been used to push catalytically (in the sense discussed above) the carboxylation of alkynes [161] (Scheme 13) or bis 1,3-dienes [162,163] in the presence of Ni(0).
The unsaturated carboxylic acids can be liberated from the relevant Zn carboxylated salt by protonolysis.
According to a different approach organozinc reagents have been used as reducing/transmetalating agents for addressing catalytically the carboxylation of unsaturates, such as styrenes (Scheme 14) [164] or internal alkynes [165], in the presence of Ni(0) catalysts, through a hydrocarboxylative pathway which allows to bypass the formation of a classic Hoberg- type oxanickelacycle.
Such hydrocarboxylative approach has been successfully applied to the carboxylation of internal alkynes by using Cu catalysts and hydrosilanes as hydride transfer agents [166], and for the synthesis of b,c-unsaturated carboxylic acids from allenes [167,168] or 1,3-dienes [169] and CO2. A new hydrocarboxylating system has been used, based on a tridentate silyl pincer palladium catalyst precursor (X = trifluoromethanesulfonate in Scheme 15) and AlEt3 (or ZnEt2).
A mild and user-friendly Ni-catalyzed regioselective hydrocar- boxylation of alkynes with CO2 (0.1 MPa) has been also described which uses Mn as reducing agent and simple alcohols as proton sources [170].
A common feature of the carboxylation reactions discussed above is the utilization of a coreactant (ZnR2, HSiR3, AlR3, etc.; usu- ally used in excess with respect to the unsaturated substrate),which is consumed to regenerate the catalytically active species (LnNi(0); LnMAH) after each cycle. Therefore, as already discussed above, all these processes are catalytic with respect to the transi- tion metal (Ni, Cu, Pd, etc.), but not with respect to the co- reagent, which is used in excess and generates waste at the end of the process. Features like the energetic cost of the species used in transmetalation (metal alkyls are quite intensive in energy) and the metal waste generated in the final step of acidolysis, contribute to increasing the E-factor and decreasing the environmental sus- tainability of these syntheses. Nevertheless these reactions provide a powerful versatile tool for the direct synthesis of complex organic molecules functionalized with carboxylic acid moieties,which, otherwise, would be produced through multistep proce- dures. Further progresses in this area are expected through the def- inition of cheaper and cleaner reducing agents and enlarging the portfolio of used unsaturated substrates. LCA should be used for

3.1.3. Carboxylic acids by CO2 incorporation into C-H bonds
The direct CH carboxylation with CO2 provides another poten- tial route to carboxylic acids (Eq. (40)). The process formally involves the insertion of CO2 into a CAH bond. The enthalpy of such a reaction can be easily calculated as it is given by the following quantities: DHr = [H(CAC) + H(OAH)]  H(CAH).
For different sub- strates major differences can be found in the values of H(CAH) and minor for H(CAC). The entropic content of the reaction is due mainly to the fact that gaseous CO2 is at the end found in a liquid or solid form. The DS will be negative so that the term TDS will be posi- tive. The DG will depend mainly on the entropic content and the overall reaction will have a positive Gibbs free energy change,making the concentration of the acid quite low at the equilibrium.
The carboxylation of methane or benzene (Eqs. (41) and (42)) exemplifies the situation at 298 K.

C6H5COOHs 42 DH  40:7 kJ=mol; DG298K  57:3 kJ=mol Various metallorganic reagents, usually obtained by the direct metalation of a CAH bond (as well as by reacting an organic halide with a metal compound), have been used for a stoichiometric carboxylation of organic substrates [171,172]. Also phenoxide anion (C6H5O) g5-coordinated to transition metal centers, such as Mn(II) [173] or Rh(I) [174], has been shown to selectively activate the para-CAH bond of the aromatic ring and, upon CO2 fixation, convert into the 4-OH-benzoic acid. Such carboxylation reactions are reminiscent of the for long time known carboxylation of Grignards reagents and are stoichiometric processes as they require 1 mol of metal per mol of organic product and should be regarded as metal-assisted carboxylations.
This feature represents a limitation making unlikely the application of these processes on a large scale.
Catalytic carboxylation of CAH bonds has been claimed to occur in presence of an active CAH bond. However, 2-dialkyl-imidazo lium-carboxylates bearing CO2 bonded at the heterocarbene moi- ety have been shown to be able to act as CO2-carrier and transfer CO2 to activated CAH bonds (Eq. (43)) [175]. The catalytic carboxy- lation of CAH bonds of heteroaromatics HetH has been carried out in presence of the system [(IPr)AuOH]/KOH (IPr = (1,3-bis(diisopro pyl)-phenylimidazol-2-ylidene) (Scheme 16) [176].R0R00Im  CO2  Substrate-H  MX !

NHCCu complexes have also been used [177,178]. When common aromatic com- pounds (benzene derivatives) are used, the carboxylation occurs quite efficiently only if electron deficient groups are present in the ring, indicating that the CAH bond must be strongly activated (acidic CAH bonds) in order that the carboxylation may occur [179].Therefore, the acidity of the CAH bond of the substrate repre- sents a limitation in these processes, although it can be modulated by controlling the substituents in the organic substrate. However,this constrain may limit the number of potentially usable sub- strates which can afford carboxylated products that may not be of general use.In principle, the interaction of the substrate with a suitable ac- tivating system, such as a metal system, may provide another way to enhance the activity of a CAH moiety. This approach is by far more appealing as it can lead to several products of industrial use. Such direct functionalization might be very useful with short chain HCs (C1AC4) that do not find a convenient use today.Recently, direct carboxylation of simple arenes under atmospheric pressure of CO2 has been achieved through a rhodium-catalyzed CAH bond activation without the assistance of a directing group,

(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.04.003 using AlMe2(OMe) [180] or AlMe1.5(OEt)1.5 [181] as reductant. Var- ious arenes such as benzene, toluene, xylene, electron-rich or electron-deficient benzene derivatives, and heteroaromatics have been directly carboxylated with high TONs [181]. Also in this case the catalytic center (Rh) is regenerated at expenses of Al, another less expensive and more common metal, but the E-factor of such synthesis is quite high making it suitable for limited applications.
Photocatalysis may offer interesting perspectives in this area.
Recently, the direct insertion of CO2 into the CAH bond of acacH (actylacetone) has been shown to occur under photocatalysis (Scheme 17) [182]. The species identified as the initiator of the reaction is the CO2 . radical anion. It extracts a H-atom either from the enolic form or from acacH itself. Coupling of COOH with the acac-radical affords the acid. Interestingly, under photocatalysis two different isomeric acids are obtained that imply the CO2 inser- tion into the activated methylenic CAH bond but also into the more inert CAH bond of the terminal ACH3 moiety, that under chemical catalysis is not affected [183].
Such approach has been used also for the photocarboxylation of 2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF) to afford 25% yields 2,3-DHF-2-COOH [184]. Noteworthy, the photocatalytic approach works in water and affords the free acid and not the salts as seen in other cases above. This feature makes the photocatalytic approach of great interest.
To date, catalytic carboxylation of CH bonds still remains a chal- lenging research area, which deserves more research efforts. The only industrial exploitation of reaction (40) is still provided by the KolbeSchmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids [185] carried out by reacting CO2 with Group 1 salts of phenol under severe con- ditions. Noteworthy, also this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic process as 1 mol of Group 1 metal (Na or K) is used per mol of phe- nol. It would be interesting to convert it into a catalytic process using phenol more than phenolates. The direct carboxylation reac- tions are of great importance, and their exploitation may have favorable impact on the chemical industry allowing the synthesis of several large market products (for instance, acetic acid, benzoic acid, long chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) through less tortu- ous and more C-efficient routes.
3.1.4. Synthesis of linear and cyclic esters from unsaturated
hydrocarbons Under suitable conditions, CO2 and unsaturated organic sub- strates (alkynes, allenes, conjugated dienes and others) can be cooligomerized catalytically. These processes open new perspec- tives in the synthesis of industrially relevant classes of compounds,such as cyclic and linear esters, by direct reaction of CO2 and unsat- urated substrates. Nevertheless, so far, these transformations have not been widely developed and in most cases are still far from exploitation.
3.1.4.1.
Catalytic cooligomerization of alkynes and
CO2. The
cooligomerization of CO2 with internal or terminal alkynes affords 2-pyrones. This reaction is effectively promoted by phosphine-Ni (0) complexes as catalysts (Scheme 18) [108,186189]. Ni(0)/ NHC (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) systems have been also developed for the synthesis of pyrones from CO2 and diynes under mild conditions (room temperature,
0.1 MPa
CO2
pressure) [190,191]. 2-Pyrones are used in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry as a building block for more complex chemical struc- tures because they may participate in cycloaddition reactions to form bicyclic lactones. Moreover, 2-pyrone structure is found in numerous natural products isolated from plants, animals, marine organisms, bacteria, fungi, and insects that exhibit a broad range of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibiotic, cytotoxic,neurotoxic and phytotoxic. A variety of synthetic methodologies of 2-pyrones have been developed and have been recently reviewed [192].
Scheme 18 summarizes the generally accepted mechanism of the Ni-catalyzed formation of pyrone.
The first step of the catalytic cycle is the formation of oxanick- elacyclopentenone A, as already discussed. This intermediate can insert another alkyne molecule into the NiAC(sp2) bond to afford the oxa-nickel-acyclo-heptadienone B, from which the pyrone pro- duct is liberated by reductive elimination. Dedicated studies have ruled out the hypothesis that pyrone formation might imply the preliminary coupling of two alkyne molecules to form a nickelacy- clopentadiene complex, followed by CO2 insertion into the NiAC bond or [4 + 2] cycloaddition to a CO2 molecule. On the contrary,nickelacyclopentadiene species are involved as intermediates only in the undesired side-reaction of alkyne cyclotrimerization. In this area Ni-based systems still continue to be among the most effec- tive catalysts. Other metal catalysts (Co [193] and Rh [194] com- plexes) are less active and less selective because of collateral substrate cyclo-oligomerization. Heterogeneous catalysts have been explored only sparingly [195].
3.1.4.2. Catalytic cooligomerization of allenes and CO2. Also allenes,
CO2-like molecules, can be cooligomerized with CO2 in the pres- ence of transition metal (Pd, Rh, Ni) catalysts [196200]. To date,this topic has received only moderate attention. Yields in carboxy- lated products are generally low to modest because of significant incidence of the undesired oligo- and polymerization of the substrate.
The reaction of allene with CO2 in the presence of Pd [196] or Rh [197] catalysts yields linear and cyclic esters (AC; Scheme 19). An Scheme 17. Photocatalytic CAH activation and CO2 insertion.

In fact, under strictly controlled experimental conditions, [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2 promoted, albeit in low yield, the formation of four-membered lac- tone 3-methylene-2-oxetanone (D, Scheme 19), which is the pro- duct of formal [2 + 2] addition of allene to CO2 [201]. This product has never been observed when allene is reacted with CO2 in absence of H2. Such four membered systems are usually obtained by converting acrylates with singlet O2 in the presence of PPh3 as acceptor of unrequired oxygen [202]. The synthesis of the four membered lactone by direct reaction of allene and CO2 is noteworthy and remains a unique evidence of coupling to afford the isomeric form of ketene.
