1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt/CeO2 is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO. Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. DFT calculations indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway. Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations, as the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在CO2-ODHP途径中对丙烯显示出有希望的选择性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中对CO具有高选择性。Fe3Ni由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成。DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni (111)界面的CH键裂解有利于CO2-ODHP途径，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面的CC键裂解有利于DRP途径。流动反应器的结果与DFT计算一致，因为Fe3Ni催化剂对丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt催化剂对CO具有良好的活性和选择性。
