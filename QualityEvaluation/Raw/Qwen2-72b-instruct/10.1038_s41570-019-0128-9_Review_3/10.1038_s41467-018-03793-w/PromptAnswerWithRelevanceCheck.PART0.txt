[1] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however,at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
[2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
[3] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the for- mation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
[4] "The Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
[5] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
[6] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
[7] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."

1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows a high selectivity of 58.2% for propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 exhibits a high selectivity of 88% for CO production via the DRP pathway. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, with a higher propylene yield than its monometallic components. Both catalysts exhibit different stability characteristics, with Fe3Ni showing minimal mass loss, suggesting that coking is not a significant deactivation pathway, while Ni3Pt loses about 8% of its original mass but does not show signs of sintering. Theoretical studies using DFT calculations reveal that the Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage pathway for CO2-ODHP, while the Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the CC bond cleavage pathway for DRP. These theoretical predictions are consistent with experimental observations, indicating that Fe3Ni promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to produce propylene, while Ni3Pt promotes the CC bond cleavage of propane to produce CO.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在CO2-ODHP途径中显示出高选择性，为58.2%的丙烯产量，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP途径中显示出高选择性，为88%的CO产量。Fe3Ni催化剂表现出协同效应，其丙烯产量高于其单金属组分。两种催化剂表现出不同的稳定性特征，Fe3Ni的失重极小，表明焦化不是主要的失活途径，而Ni3Pt失重约8%，但没有显示出烧结的迹象。使用DFT计算的理论研究表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面有利于CO2-ODHP的CH键裂解途径，而Ni3Pt(111)表面有利于DRP的CC键裂解途径。这些理论预测与实验观察一致，表明Fe3Ni促进丙烷的氧化CH键裂解以产生丙烯，而Ni3Pt促进丙烷的CC键裂解以产生CO。

1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 exhibits promising selectivity for propylene production via the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), with a steady-state propylene selectivity of 58.2%. In contrast, the Ni3Pt/CeO2 catalyst is highly active for the dry reforming of propane (DRP), achieving a CO2 conversion of 39% and a robust selectivity of 88% towards CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, with a higher propylene yield compared to the respective monometallic catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on the Ni3Pt(111) surface, while the CH bond cleavage pathway is preferred on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface. Experimental results align with DFT predictions, as Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production and Ni3Pt shows good activity and selectivity for CO. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, which may contribute to its selectivity for propylene production.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在CO2-ODHP途径中对丙烯显示出有希望的选择性，丙烯的产率为1.6%（基于C3H8）。该催化剂稳定，损失的原始质量不到一半，表明主要的失活途径不太可能是由于焦化。Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化态。DFT计算表明，bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111)表面倾向于CH键裂解途径，促进丙烷的氧化CH键裂解形成*CH3CHCH2。相比之下，双金属催化剂Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO具有高选择性，CO2转化率为39%，在可比较的反应物转化率下，对CO具有稳健的选择性为88%。该催化剂损失了约8%的原始质量，但没有显示出烧结的迹象。Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt和金属Ni组成。DFT结果表明，CC键裂解途径在Ni3Pt(111)上是优选的，促进丙烷的C-C键裂解形成*CO。DFT预测与实验观察一致。
