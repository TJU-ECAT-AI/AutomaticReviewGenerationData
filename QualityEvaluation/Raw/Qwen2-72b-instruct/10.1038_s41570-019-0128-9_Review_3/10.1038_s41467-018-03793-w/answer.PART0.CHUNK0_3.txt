1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 exhibits promising selectivity for propylene production via the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), with a steady-state propylene selectivity of 58.2%. In contrast, the Ni3Pt/CeO2 catalyst is highly active for the dry reforming of propane (DRP), achieving a CO2 conversion of 39% and a robust selectivity of 88% towards CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, with a higher propylene yield compared to the respective monometallic catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on the Ni3Pt(111) surface, while the CH bond cleavage pathway is preferred on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface. Experimental results align with DFT predictions, as Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production and Ni3Pt shows good activity and selectivity for CO. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, which may contribute to its selectivity for propylene production.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）反应中，显示出对丙烯生产的有希望的高选择性，稳态下丙烯选择性为58.2%。相比之下，Ni3Pt/CeO2催化剂在丙烷干重整（DRP）反应中表现出高活性，CO2转化率达到39%，对CO的稳健选择性为88%。Fe3Ni催化剂表现出协同效应，与各自的单金属催化剂相比，丙烯产量更高。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Ni3Pt(111)表面倾向于CC键裂解途径，而Fe3Ni(111)表面倾向于CH键裂解途径。实验结果与DFT预测一致，Fe3Ni对丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt对CO表现出良好的活性和选择性。原位XANES测量显示，Fe3Ni由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成，这可能对其丙烯生产的选择性有贡献。
