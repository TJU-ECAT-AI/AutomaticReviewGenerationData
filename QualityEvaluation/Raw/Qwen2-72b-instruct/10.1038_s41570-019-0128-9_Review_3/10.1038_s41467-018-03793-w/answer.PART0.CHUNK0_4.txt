[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway,whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[2] "Fe3Ni demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "Ni3Pt primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
[4] "Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
[5] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
[6] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
[7] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
[8] "The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."
[9] "The Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."

1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, with a propylene yield of 1.6% on a C3H8 basis. The catalyst is stable, with less than half a percent of its original mass lost, indicating that the main deactivation pathway is unlikely to be due to coking. The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst is in the oxidized form. The DFT calculations reveal that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage pathway, promoting the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2. In contrast, the bimetallic catalyst Ni3Pt/CeO2 is active for the DRP reaction with high selectivity toward CO, with a CO2 conversion of 39% and a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions. The catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering. The Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt and metallic Ni. The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), promoting the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO. The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在CO2-ODHP途径中对丙烯显示出有希望的选择性，丙烯的产率为1.6%（基于C3H8）。该催化剂稳定，损失的原始质量不到一半，表明主要的失活途径不太可能是由于焦化。Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化态。DFT计算表明，bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111)表面倾向于CH键裂解途径，促进丙烷的氧化CH键裂解形成*CH3CHCH2。相比之下，双金属催化剂Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO具有高选择性，CO2转化率为39%，在可比较的反应物转化率下，对CO具有稳健的选择性为88%。该催化剂损失了约8%的原始质量，但没有显示出烧结的迹象。Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt和金属Ni组成。DFT结果表明，CC键裂解途径在Ni3Pt(111)上是优选的，促进丙烷的C-C键裂解形成*CO。DFT预测与实验观察一致。
