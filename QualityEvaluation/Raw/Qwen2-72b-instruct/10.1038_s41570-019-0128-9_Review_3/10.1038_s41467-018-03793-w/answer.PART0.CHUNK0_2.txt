1.The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for propylene production through the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is active for the DRP reaction with high selectivity toward CO. Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. DFT calculations indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway. Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations, showing that Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production and Ni3Pt has good activity and CO selectivity.

1.双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在CO2-ODHP途径中对丙烯生产显示出有希望的选择性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO具有高选择性。Fe3Ni由氧化Fe和金属Ni组成。DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni (111)界面的CH键裂解有利于CO2-ODHP途径，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面有利于DRP途径的CC键裂解。流动反应器结果与DFT计算一致，表明Fe3Ni对丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt具有良好的活性和CO选择性。
