          [1] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however,at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
          [2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
          [3] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the for- mation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
          [4] "The Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [5] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
          [6] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
          [7] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
          [8] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway,whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
          [9] "Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni."
          [10] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2- ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."
          [11] "Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity."
          [12] "Fe3Ni demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
          [13] "Ni3Pt primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
          [14] "Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [15] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
          [16] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
          [17] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
          [18] "The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."
          [19] "The Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."

          The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for propylene production through the CO2-ODHP pathway, with a steady-state propylene selectivity of 58.2%. In contrast, the Ni3Pt/CeO2 catalyst is highly active for the dry reforming of propane (DRP), achieving a CO2 conversion of 39% and a robust selectivity of 88% towards CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, with a higher propylene yield compared to the respective monometallic catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on the Ni3Pt(111) surface, while the CH bond cleavage pathway is preferred on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface. Experimental results align with DFT predictions, as Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production and Ni3Pt shows good activity and selectivity for CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst is stable, with less than half a percent of its original mass lost, indicating that the main deactivation pathway is unlikely to be due to coking. The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering. The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst is in the oxidized form, and the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt and metallic Ni.

          双金属催化剂Fe3Ni/CeO2在二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）反应中，显示出对丙烯生产的有希望的高选择性，稳态下丙烯选择性为58.2%。相比之下，Ni3Pt/CeO2催化剂在丙烷干重整（DRP）反应中表现出高活性，CO2转化率达到39%，对CO的稳健选择性为88%。Fe3Ni催化剂表现出协同效应，与各自的单金属催化剂相比，丙烯产量更高。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Ni3Pt(111)表面倾向于CC键裂解途径，而Fe3Ni(111)表面倾向于CH键裂解途径。实验结果与DFT预测一致，Fe3Ni对丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt对CO表现出良好的活性和选择性。Fe3Ni催化剂稳定，损失的原始质量不到一半，表明主要的失活途径不太可能是由于焦化。Ni3Pt催化剂损失了约8%的原始质量，但没有显示出烧结的迹象。Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化态，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt和金属Ni组成。
