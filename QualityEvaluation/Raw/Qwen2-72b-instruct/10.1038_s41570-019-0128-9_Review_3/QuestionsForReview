How do the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, and what insights can be gained from experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies regarding their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction?
