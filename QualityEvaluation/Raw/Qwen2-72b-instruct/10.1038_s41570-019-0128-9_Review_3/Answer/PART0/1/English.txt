The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have been identified as promising for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for C3H6 with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is highly active for DRP with 96% selectivity for CO. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is evidenced by the higher C3H6 yield compared to the respective monometallic catalysts. Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. DFT studies suggest that Fe3Ni(111) favors CH scission over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, facilitating selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, while Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, allowing for rapid formation of oxygenated intermediates in reforming.

The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for propylene production through the CO2-ODHP pathway, with a steady-state propylene selectivity of 58.2%. In contrast, the Ni3Pt/CeO2 catalyst is highly active for the dry reforming of propane (DRP), achieving a CO2 conversion of 39% and a robust selectivity of 88% towards CO.

The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering. The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst is in the oxidized form, and the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt and metallic Ni.

The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed activity in the CO2-ODH reaction with propane, achieving steady-state conversions of 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8, with selectivities of 32% for C3H6 and 65% for CO. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and stability in the DRP reaction, with a conversion of CO2 that was 2.5 times higher than that of the Co3Pd1/CeO2 catalyst. Both Ni3Pt1/CeO2 and Ni3Pd1/CeO2 catalysts were found to be effective for the DRP reaction, exhibiting higher activity and stability compared to their Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3. The apparent activation barrier for the reforming route over the Co3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1, while for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 it was 119 kJmol-1. The TGA weight loss for Ni3Pt1/CeO2 was reported to be 8%, and for Co3Pt1/CeO2, it was 4%. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions, which was also the case for the DRP Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalyst. The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts showed a preference for forming propylene but had low performance due to deactivation. The Fe3Co1/CeO2 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst. The DRP Co3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, consisted of metallic Ni and metallic Co under reaction conditions.
