          [7] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
          [8] "The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have low performance due to deactivation."
          [9] "The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst"
          [10] "Figure 9(b-c) depicts the in situ XANES spectra of the DRP Co3Ni1 catalyst which demonstrated that under reaction conditions the catalyst consisted of metallic Ni and metallic Co;"

[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
          [2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
          [3] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
          [4] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
          [5] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."
          [6] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
          [7] "Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scission and the formation of C3H6."

[1] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however,at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
          [2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
          [3] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the for- mation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
          [4] "The Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [5] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
          [6] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
          [7] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
          [8] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway,whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
          [9] "Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni."
          [10] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2- ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."
          [11] "Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity."
          [12] "Fe3Ni demonstrates propylene production from the CO2- ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
          [13] "Ni3Pt primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions."
          [14] "Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [15] "The Ni3Pt catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate signs of sintering."
          [16] "The DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
          [17] "The DFT predictions are in agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt- terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage of propane to form *CO."
          [18] "The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."
          [19] "The Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."

[1] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion,respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."
          [3] "On the other hand, both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."
          [4] "The apparent activation barrier of the reforming route over the Co3Pt1 catalyst was 126 kJmol-1 and the previously reported value for Ni3Pt1 was 119 kJmol-1,"
          [5] "The previously reported TGA weight loss of Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and the Co3Pt1 catalyst in this study lost 4%,"
          [6] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
          [7] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
