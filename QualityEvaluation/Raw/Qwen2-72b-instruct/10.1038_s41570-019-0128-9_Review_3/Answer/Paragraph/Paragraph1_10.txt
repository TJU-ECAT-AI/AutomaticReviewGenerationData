In a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study, the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were compared in CO2-olefin direct dehydration (ODH) and dehydrogenation (DRP) reactions with propane. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated a higher activity and selectivity for the desired products in CO2-ODH, attributed to its unique electronic structure and enhanced CO2 activation capability. Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 showed superior performance in DRP, with increased propane conversion and higher yields of propylene. Theoretical calculations revealed that the difference in performance could be linked to the distinct adsorption strengths of CO2 and H2 on the bimetallic surfaces, influencing the reaction pathways. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 facilitated CO2 dissociation, promoting the ODH pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favored H2 dissociation, enhancing DRP. These findings highlight the critical role of bimetallic composition in tailoring catalysts for specific reaction mechanisms and product selectivity.
