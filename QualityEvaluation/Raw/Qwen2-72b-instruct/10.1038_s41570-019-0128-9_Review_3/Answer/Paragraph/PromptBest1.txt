Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are promising for CO2-ODH and DRP with propane, respectively \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows 58% C3H6 selectivity and stability, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is active for DRP with 96% CO selectivity \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. Synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 boosts C3H6 yield \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 features metallic Pt, and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 includes metallic Ni and oxidized Fe \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. DFT studies indicate Fe3Ni(111) favors CH scission over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\]. Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, promoting selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, whereas Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, enabling rapid formation of oxygenated intermediates in reforming \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\].

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel bimetallic catalysts that can further enhance the selectivity and efficiency of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The synergistic effects observed in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 suggest that the careful selection and design of bimetallic systems could lead to catalysts with improved performance for alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Additionally, the integration of experimental and theoretical studies, such as DFT calculations, can provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and help guide the rational design of catalysts. The exploration of environmentally benign catalysis, particularly in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction, is a promising direction for future research.
