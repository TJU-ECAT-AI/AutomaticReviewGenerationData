Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% CO selectivity \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2's C3H6 yield exceeds monometallic catalysts, indicating synergy \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, Fe3Ni/CeO2 includes metallic Ni and oxidized Fe \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. DFT studies suggest Fe3Ni(111) favors CH over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, aiding selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, whereas Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, allowing rapid oxygenated intermediate formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high selectivity for propylene production via CO2-ODHP, achieving 58.2% C3H6 selectivity \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is active for DRP with 39% CO2 conversion and 88% CO selectivity \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Fe3Ni demonstrates a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yield than monometallics \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Fe3Ni is stable, losing <0.5% mass, unlikely due to coking \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Ni3Pt loses 8% mass without sintering \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. DFT reveals CC bond cleavage on Ni3Pt(111) and CH bond cleavage on Fe3Ni(111) \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Experimental results align with DFT, showing Fe3Ni's selectivity for propylene and Ni3Pt's activity for CO \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 was active in CO2-ODH, achieving 2.6% CO2 and 1.1% C3H8 conversion, with 32% C3H6 and 65% CO selectivities \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 excelled in DRP, with higher activity and stability than Pt and Pd counterparts \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and DRP Fe1Ni3/CeO2 contained metallic Ni and oxidized Fe \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. Fe-Co bimetallics favored propylene formation but had low performance due to deactivation \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. Fe3Co1/CeO2 had less Fe oxidation than Fe3Ni1/CeO2 \[10.1002/aic.16670\]. DRP Co3Ni1/CeO2 consisted of metallic Ni and Co under reaction conditions \[10.1002/aic.16670\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel bimetallic catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The synergistic effects observed in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 suggest that the design of catalysts with tailored metal combinations could lead to improved performance. Theoretical studies, such as DFT calculations, can play a crucial role in predicting the behavior of new catalysts and guiding experimental efforts. Moreover, the investigation of the deactivation mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Fe-Co systems, could provide insights into strategies for enhancing catalyst longevity. The potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction highlights the importance of developing catalysts that not only perform well but also contribute to sustainable chemical processes. The exploration of alternative reaction conditions, such as the use of renewable energy sources for heating or the integration of CO2 capture and conversion technologies, could further enhance the environmental benefits of these catalytic systems.

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel bimetallic catalysts that can further enhance the selectivity and efficiency of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The synergistic effects observed in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 suggest that the careful selection and combination of metals can lead to improved catalytic performance. Moreover, the role of support materials, such as CeO2, in modulating the electronic and structural properties of the active metals should be further investigated. The integration of experimental techniques with advanced computational methods, like DFT, will be crucial in understanding the complex reaction mechanisms and in guiding the rational design of catalysts. Additionally, the exploration of environmentally benign catalysis, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions and increase global alkene production, is a promising direction that warrants further attention. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and the investigation of alternative feedstocks could also contribute to the advancement of this field.
