Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2's higher C3H6 yield than monometallic counterparts indicates synergy \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Ni3Pt/CeO2 has metallic Pt, Fe3Ni/CeO2 has metallic Ni and oxidized Fe \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. DFT studies suggest Fe3Ni(111) favors CH over CC scission, unlike Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Fe3Ni(111) binds oxygen strongly, promoting selective CH scission and C3H6 formation, whereas Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds oxygen moderately, enabling rapid oxygenated intermediate formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\].

In the realm of catalytic science, bimetallic catalysts have garnered significant attention for their enhanced performance in various chemical transformations, particularly in the context of CO2-olefin direct coupling (CO2-ODH) and dehydrogenation reactions (DRP) with propane. This review segment delves into a comparative analysis of two prominent bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2, elucidating their performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in these reactions through an amalgamation of experimental and theoretical studies.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct catalytic behaviors in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, primarily attributed to their unique electronic and geometric properties. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates a superior CO2 conversion rate and selectivity towards propylene in CO2-ODH, owing to the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and the dehydrogenation of propane. This is corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal a lower activation barrier for CO2 activation on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 compared to Ni3Pt1/CeO2. The presence of CeO2 as a support further enhances the redox properties of the catalyst, promoting the regeneration of active sites and thus improving the overall catalytic performance.

Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits a higher activity in the DRP of propane, with an enhanced selectivity towards propylene. The Pt component in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation mechanism, offering a more favorable pathway for the removal of hydrogen atoms from propane. Theoretical studies indicate that the Pt-Ni interaction in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 leads to a more efficient distribution of charge, which is conducive to the activation of C-H bonds in propane. Moreover, the CeO2 support contributes to the stability of the catalyst by preventing the sintering of metal nanoparticles, thereby maintaining high catalytic activity over prolonged reaction times.

The comparative analysis of these bimetallic catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions underscores the importance of metal composition and support in tailoring the catalytic properties for specific reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2's superiority in CO2-ODH can be attributed to its ability to efficiently activate CO2, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2's dominance in DRP is linked to its enhanced dehydrogenation capability. These findings not only provide insights into the design of efficient bimetallic catalysts for CO2 valorization and hydrocarbon dehydrogenation but also highlight the potential of CeO2 as a versatile support material that can significantly influence the catalytic performance.

In conclusion, the experimental and theoretical investigation of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane reveals the intricate interplay between metal composition, support properties, and reaction mechanisms. This comparative analysis not only enriches our understanding of bimetallic catalysts' behavior in these reactions but also paves the way for the rational design of catalysts for sustainable chemical processes.
