1.Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are active for CO2-ODHP, with the C3H6 yield decreasing in the order of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3. Cr2O3 performs better than Fe2O3 and Ga2O3 on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The nature of the support significantly affects the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, which in turn determines the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species follows a sequence from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and finally crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for optimal Cr-dependent activity. (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 with a 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to a decrease in both. The activity of (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is associated with well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures.

1. Ga2O3, Fe2O3和Cr2O3对CO2-ODHP具有活性，C3H6的产率按Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3的顺序递减。在SiO2和Al2O3支持下，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面优于Fe2O3和Ga2O3。支持物的性质显著影响Cr物种的分散和演变，从而决定了催化剂的内在活性。在SiO2支持的Cr催化剂上，Cr物种的演变遵循从接枝Cr6+到分散Cr6+氧化物，再到微晶Cr3+，最后到结晶α-Cr2O3的序列，随着Cr负载量的增加。Cr单层覆盖是Cr依赖性活性的阈值。Cr负载量为5 wt. %的(Cr2O3)5/SiO2在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出最佳性能，而更高的Cr负载量导致两者均下降。在(Cr2O3)5/SiO2上的活性与分散良好的单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐相关，而高Cr负载量导致形成活性较低的扩展多铬酸盐结构。
