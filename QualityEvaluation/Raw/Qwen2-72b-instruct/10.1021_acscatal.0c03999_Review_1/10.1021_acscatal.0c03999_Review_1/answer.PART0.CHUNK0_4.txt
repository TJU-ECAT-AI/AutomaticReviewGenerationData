[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
[2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
[3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
[4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
[5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
[6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
[7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
[8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."

1.The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties.
2.On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures.

1.各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性不同，Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3的活性最高，按此顺序排列。在SiO2和Al2O3支持的金属氧化物中，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面表现最佳。催化性能受金属氧化物分散度、氧化还原性质以及支持物性质（包括纹理和酸碱性质）等因素的影响。
2.在SiO2支持的Cr催化剂上，Cr物种的演变取决于负载量，遵循以下序列：接枝的Cr6+、分散的Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+和结晶α-Cr2O3，随着Cr负载量的增加。Cr单层覆盖度通常是最佳活性的阈值。5 wt. % Cr负载的(Cr2O3)5/SiO2催化剂在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出最佳性能，而更高的Cr负载量会导致活性下降。在(Cr2O3)5/SiO2上的显著活性归因于分散良好的单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐，而高Cr负载量导致形成活性较低的扩展多铬酸盐结构。
