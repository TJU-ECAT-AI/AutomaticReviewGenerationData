1.The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 on SiO2 and Al2O3 outperforms others in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties.
2.On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species is loading-dependent, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for optimal activity. (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 with 5 wt.% Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity due to the formation of less active polychromate structures.

1.Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are active for CO2-ODHP, with the C3H6 yield decreasing in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2. Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity for SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts. The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP are influenced by the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, which are determined by the nature of the support. The generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2-ODHP, and the structural evolution of Cr species depends heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The optimal Cr-dependent activity is achieved at a monolayer Cr coverage, with the C3H6 yield increasing with an increase in Cr content below this threshold. However, beyond this threshold, excess redox Cr species cannot be attached to the support, leading to the formation of unstable Cr species that may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. Metal oxides, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2, have been widely used as support materials. To clarify the support effect, aspects such as metalsupport interaction, acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer have been explored.

1.对于CO2-ODHP，Ga2O3，Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出活性，C3H6的产率按以下顺序递减：Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2。对于SiO2和Al2O3支持的催化剂，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面优于其他两种金属氧化物。金属氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性受Cr物种的分散和演变的影响，这取决于支持物的性质。对于支持的Cr催化剂，较低氧化态（Cr3+/Cr2+）的Cr物种的生成和分散对于在CO2-ODHP中获得高C3H6产率至关重要，Cr物种的结构演变在很大程度上取决于Cr覆盖率和支持物的纹理性质。在单层Cr覆盖率下达到最佳的Cr依赖性活性，C3H6的产率通常随着Cr含量的增加而增加，但低于此阈值。然而，超过这个阈值，多余的氧化还原Cr物种无法与支持物结合，导致不稳定的Cr物种可能分解为无活性的非氧化还原结晶α-Cr2O3颗粒。Cr结构的变异也对Cr负载敏感，这可以决定活性。支持物的性质在影响Cr物种的分散和演变方面起着重要作用，从而决定了内在活性。金属氧化物，如Al2O3，ZrO2，CeO2，TiO2和SiO2，已被广泛用作支持材料。为了阐明支持物效应，已经探索了以下方面：金属支持物相互作用，吸附和活化反应分子的酸碱性质，以及与Cr物种分散和质量传递相关的纹理性质。

1.Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are active for CO2-ODHP, with the C3H6 yield decreasing in the order of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3. Cr2O3 performs better than Fe2O3 and Ga2O3 on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The nature of the support significantly affects the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, which in turn determines the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species follows a sequence from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and finally crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for optimal Cr-dependent activity. (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 with a 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to a decrease in both. The activity of (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is associated with well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures.

1. Ga2O3, Fe2O3和Cr2O3对CO2-ODHP具有活性，C3H6的产率按Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3的顺序递减。在SiO2和Al2O3支持下，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面优于Fe2O3和Ga2O3。支持物的性质显著影响Cr物种的分散和演变，从而决定了催化剂的内在活性。在SiO2支持的Cr催化剂上，Cr物种的演变遵循从接枝Cr6+到分散Cr6+氧化物，再到微晶Cr3+，最后到结晶α-Cr2O3的序列，随着Cr负载量的增加。Cr单层覆盖是Cr依赖性活性的阈值。Cr负载量为5 wt. %的(Cr2O3)5/SiO2在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出最佳性能，而更高的Cr负载量导致两者均下降。在(Cr2O3)5/SiO2上的活性与分散良好的单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐相关，而高Cr负载量导致形成活性较低的扩展多铬酸盐结构。
