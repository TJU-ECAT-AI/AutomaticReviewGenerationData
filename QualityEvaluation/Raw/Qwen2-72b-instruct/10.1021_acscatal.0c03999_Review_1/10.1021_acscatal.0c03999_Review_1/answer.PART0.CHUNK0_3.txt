1.Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are active for CO2-ODHP, with the C3H6 yield decreasing in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2.

1. Ga2O3, Fe2O3和Cr2O3在CO2-ODHP中表现出活性，C3H6的产率按以下顺序递减：Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2。对于SiO2和Al2O3支持的催化剂，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面优于其他两种金属氧化物。载体的性质对Cr物种的分散和演变至关重要，从而决定了内在活性。对于支持的Cr催化剂，Cr物种在较低氧化态（即Cr3+/Cr2+）的生成和分散对于CO2ODHP中实现高C3H6产率至关重要，其结构演变在很大程度上取决于Cr覆盖度和支持物的纹理性质。在SiO2支持的Cr催化剂上，Cr物种的负载依赖性演变遵循以下序列：接枝Cr6+  分散Cr6+氧化物  微晶Cr3+  结晶α-Cr2O3，随着Cr负载量的增加。在5 wt. % Cr负载量下，(Cr2O3)5/SiO2在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出最佳性能，而(Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2在更高Cr负载量下导致两者均减少。在(Cr2O3)5/SiO2上，突出的活性与分散的单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐相关；然而，高Cr负载量会导致形成扩展的多铬酸盐结构，这些结构的活性较低。Cr结构的变异也对Cr负载量敏感，这可以决定活性。Botavina等人制备了一系列Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，Cr负载量范围广泛（0.57.5 wt. %），并达到了与工业过程要求相当的活性（例如，转化率  50%和烯烃  90%）。漫反射UVvis结果揭示了Cr结构沿负载的演变：（i）Cr(VI)以单、二和多铬酸盐的形式存在于所有新鲜催化剂中，（ii）Cr(III)仅以（α-Cr2O3）的形式存在于较高Cr负载量（即  3.0 wt. %）下。载体的性质对Cr物种的分散和演变至关重要，决定了内在活性。在支撑材料中，金属氧化物被广泛使用，例如Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2、TiO2和SiO2。为了更好地分散Cr，有序的介孔材料，如SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41，以及具有可调表面功能基团的碳基载体也是有前景的候选材料。为了阐明载体效应，以下方面已经进行了探索，包括（i）金属-载体相互作用，（ii）在反应物分子的吸附和活化中的酸碱性质，以及（iii）纹理性质及其与Cr物种分散和质量传递的相关性。
