1.The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond. Among these, SiO2 and mesoporous SiO2 have shown the most promising results. The document also indicates that the features of supported chromium species, including their structure-function relationships, have been assessed using DR UVvis spectroscopy. It is suggested that the activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates. The introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The document does not provide a detailed analysis of the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

1.该文件没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细分析影响其催化性能的关键因素。然而，它确实提到，在CO2存在下，C2C4烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，最佳性能是在各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上支持的铬催化剂上获得的。其中，SiO2和介孔SiO2显示出最有希望的结果。该文件还指出，使用DR UVvis光谱法评估了支撑铬物种的特征，包括它们的结构-功能关系。据建议，催化剂的活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐相关。在反应混合物中引入高达5.0 vol.%的氧气会导致催化剂活性和稳定性的显著增加。该文件没有提供关于支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数的详细分析。
