1.The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond. Among these, silica-supported chromium catalysts have shown the most promising results. The document also notes that the features of supported chromium species can be assessed by DR UVvis spectroscopy to gain insights into their structure-function relationships. It is suggested that the activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates.

1.该文件没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细分析影响其催化性能的关键因素。但是，它确实提到，在CO2存在下，C2-C4烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，最佳性能是通过在各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上支持铬获得的。在这些催化剂中，以二氧化硅为载体的铬催化剂显示出最有希望的结果。文件还指出，可以通过DR UVvis光谱法评估支持的铬物种的特征，以深入了解其结构-功能关系。据建议，催化剂的活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐有关。
