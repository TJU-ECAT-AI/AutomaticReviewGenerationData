1.The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability.

1.该文件没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。但是，它确实提到，在CO2存在下，C2C4烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，性能最好的是各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上负载的铬，其中SiO2和金刚石负载1.7-8.0 wt% Cr的结果最令人鼓舞。催化剂的活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐有关，而在反应混合物中引入氧气至5.0 vol.%会导致催化剂活性和稳定性的显著增加。
