1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的作用。在丙烷脱氢中，高活性和选择性的最佳Cr含量被发现约为5 wt.%。Cr负载的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，这会部分阻塞微孔并降低催化活性。活性碳载体在催化过程中起着关键作用，表面含氧物种如羰基和羧基作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。在进料中存在CO2部分保护了活性碳基催化剂免受失活的影响，稳定了表面基团。铬物种的演变作为负载和载体性质的函数影响了丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that the CrOx-containing active carbons were found to be extremely active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The catalytic activity and selectivity were found to strongly depend on the Cr loading, with the highest propane conversions achieved for the sample with a Cr content close to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores, and a decrease in catalytic activity. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based samples.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实指出，含CrOx的活性炭被发现是丙烷脱氢在二氧化碳存在下极其有效的催化剂。催化活性和选择性被发现强烈依赖于Cr的负载，丙烷转化率最高的样品Cr含量接近5 wt.%。Cr负载的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，微孔的部分堵塞，以及催化活性的降低。虽然没有明确讨论Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和载体性质的关系，但可以推断，铬的高分散性是影响活性炭基样品催化活性的关键参数。

An increase in the Cr loading results in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores, and a decrease in catalytic activity. The active carbon-based catalyst undergoes fast deactivation due to the removal of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface during the propane dehydrogenation process.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和支持物性质的关系。但是，它确实指出CrOx-含活性炭对于在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢的催化活性和选择性强烈依赖于Cr的负载，丙烷转化率最高的样品Cr含量接近5 wt.%。Cr负载的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，微孔的局部堵塞，以及催化活性的降低。基于活性炭的催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中由于表面羰基和羧基样物种的去除以及催化剂表面形成非活性焦炭而迅速失活。

However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for the catalyst was found to be around 5 wt.%, with higher loadings leading to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which is less active in alkane dehydrogenation. The support properties, such as surface area and pore volume, also influence the catalytic performance. An increase in Cr loading results in a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in surface area, which negatively impacts activity.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有讨论负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。但是，它确实提到CrOx含量的活性炭对于在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢的催化活性和选择性强烈依赖于Cr负载量，丙烷转化率最高的样品Cr含量接近5 wt.%。Cr负载量的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，微孔的部分堵塞，以及催化活性的降低。活性碳基催化剂由于在丙烷脱氢过程中表面羰基和羧基样表面物种的浓度逐渐降低以及催化剂表面形成无活性焦炭，导致快速失活。
