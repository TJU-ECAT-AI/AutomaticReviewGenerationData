1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that the CrOx-containing active carbons were found to be extremely active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The catalytic activity and selectivity were found to strongly depend on the Cr loading, with the highest propane conversions achieved for the sample with a Cr content close to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores, and a decrease in catalytic activity. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based samples.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实指出，含CrOx的活性炭被发现是丙烷脱氢在二氧化碳存在下极其有效的催化剂。催化活性和选择性被发现强烈依赖于Cr的负载，丙烷转化率最高的样品Cr含量接近5 wt.%。Cr负载的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，微孔的部分堵塞，以及催化活性的降低。虽然没有明确讨论Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和载体性质的关系，但可以推断，铬的高分散性是影响活性炭基样品催化活性的关键参数。
