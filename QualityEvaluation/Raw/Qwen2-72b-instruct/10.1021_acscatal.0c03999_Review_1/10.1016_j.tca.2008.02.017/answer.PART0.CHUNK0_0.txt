1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的作用。在丙烷脱氢中，高活性和选择性的最佳Cr含量被发现约为5 wt.%。Cr负载的增加导致结晶-Cr2O3相的形成，这会部分阻塞微孔并降低催化活性。活性碳载体在催化过程中起着关键作用，表面含氧物种如羰基和羧基作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。在进料中存在CO2部分保护了活性碳基催化剂免受失活的影响，稳定了表面基团。铬物种的演变作为负载和载体性质的函数影响了丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。
