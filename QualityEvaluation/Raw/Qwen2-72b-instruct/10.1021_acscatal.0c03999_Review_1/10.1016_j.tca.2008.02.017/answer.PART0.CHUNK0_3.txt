1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for the catalyst was found to be around 5 wt.%, with higher loadings leading to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which is less active in alkane dehydrogenation. The support properties, such as surface area and pore volume, also influence the catalytic performance. An increase in Cr loading results in a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in surface area, which negatively impacts activity.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的作用。发现Cr含量的最佳值约为5 wt.%，更高的负载会导致形成结晶的-Cr2O3相，这种相在烷烃脱氢中活性较低。支撑物的性质，如表面积和孔体积，也影响催化性能。Cr负载的增加导致微孔部分堵塞和表面积减少，这会负面影响活性。
