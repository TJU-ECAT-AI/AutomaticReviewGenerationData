          The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

          文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到基于铬氧化物的材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为是CO2-PDH非常有前景的催化剂。在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的机制很复杂，涉及Cr(II)或/和Cr(III)物种参与非氧化脱氢或各种氧化还原机制，其中二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂参与氧化脱氢途径。高分散性和还原性铬物种的存在是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的重要因素。铬通常分散在支撑体上，而MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx等介孔材料是很好的支撑体，因为它们的大比表面积允许高分散性和高浓度的铬氧化物种。虽然没有明确讨论负载和载体性质对支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响，但确实指出，Cr的还原位点数量与丙烯产量之间存在良好的相关性，直到Cr的含量达到2 wt %。Beta沸石的脱铝化和随后通过简单浸渍分散铬，为CO2-PDH提供了优秀的催化剂。
