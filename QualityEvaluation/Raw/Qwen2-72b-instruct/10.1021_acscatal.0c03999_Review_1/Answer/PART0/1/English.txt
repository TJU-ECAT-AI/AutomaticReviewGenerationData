The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance.

It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state. The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the role of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The optimal Cr content for high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation was found to be around 5 wt.%. An increase in Cr loading led to the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocked micropores and decreased catalytic activity. The active carbon support played a crucial role in the catalytic process, with surface oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups acting as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protected the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by stabilizing the surface groups. The evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.

The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.

The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. The catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased with increasing Cr content, but this did not affect the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher Cr loadings. All catalysts contained only surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers, and they were stable against irreversible deactivation even after 900 minutes of testing, achieving propene yields as high as 40%. Spectroscopic and catalytic results suggest that the oxidation state of Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction may correlate with propene selectivity.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts. The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The chromium loading level also influences the effect of CO2, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with higher chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3 with higher loading.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support are also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.
