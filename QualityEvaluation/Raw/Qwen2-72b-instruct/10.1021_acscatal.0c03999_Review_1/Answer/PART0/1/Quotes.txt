          [2] "In the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities."
          [3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+),whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading,the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
          [4] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."



[1] "Catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
          [2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."
          [3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
          [4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
          [5] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
          [6] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."
          [7] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."





[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation."
          [2] "It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
          [3] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
          [4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
          [5] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
          [6] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
          [7] "The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from 1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr."
          [8] "The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD (Fig. 1.) and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements (Fig. 2.)."
          [9] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
          [10] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."
          [11] "CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle: C3H8  MeOx  C3H6  MeOx1  H2O (1) CO2  MeOx1  CO  MeOx (2)"
          [12] "On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the reverse watergas shift reaction (4)."

          [14] "The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy- drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation."
          [15] "Such promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts."
          [16] "The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization."
          [17] "In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry."
          [18] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
          [19] "However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts."
          [20] "Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2."
          [21] "The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system."
          [22] "While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances."
          [23] "For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
          [24] "Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [68], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (6001100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability."
          [25] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr."
          [26] "In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
          [27] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
          [28] "This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2."
          [29] "It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [30] "The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2."
          [31] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
          [32] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
          [33] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
          [34] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
          [2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
          [3] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
          [4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
          [5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."



[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

          [13] "So the coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalyt- ically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of the Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."
          [14] "The above calculation can also explain the different catalytic performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."

          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."

          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."

          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."

          [25] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr."
          [26] "In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
          [27] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
          [28] "This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2."
          [29] "It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [30] "The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2."
          [31] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
          [32] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
          [33] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
          [34] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
          [2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
          [3] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
          [4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
          [5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."



[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
          [2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
          [3] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."

[1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."



[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."



[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
          [2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."



[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

          [3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."
          [4] "The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
          [6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
          [7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."

          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."

          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."

          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"

          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."

[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."

          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."

          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
          [4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."





[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide mate- rials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states,the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interac- tion."
          [3] "These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor,preparation conditions (e.g.,calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point IEP)"
          [4] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
          [5] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
          [6] "These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites"
          [7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
          [8] "The forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
          [9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
          [10] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst"

          [4] "Michorczyk et al. [27] investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS. Pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures."
          [5] "The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C [15,28]."

          [13] "So the coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalyt- ically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of the Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."
          [14] "The above calculation can also explain the different catalytic performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species."
          [15] "So a fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of 7CrAZrO2 catalysts and the catalytic performance for the DHP reaction with CO2 is established on the atomic and molecular level."
