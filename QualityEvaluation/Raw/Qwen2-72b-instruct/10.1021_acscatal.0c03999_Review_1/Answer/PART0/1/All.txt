However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance.

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.", "Chinese": "已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。目前，铬物种在CO2 ODP反应中的价态仍存在争议，特别是在DHP与CO2反应的真实条件下，对于ZrO2基催化剂的Cr物种，较少有operando表征。几个研究小组报告说，从初始聚集体Cr6+还原得到的配位不饱和Cr3+比初始孤立Cr6+的还原形式更活跃。原位光谱技术的发展使得在反应条件下探测这些催化剂成为可能。Michorczyk等人通过原位UVvis DRS研究了Cr/SBA-1催化剂，发现纯CO2能够将Cr2+氧化为Cr3+和Cr6+物种，表面羧酸盐可能在宽温度范围内CO2活化中起重要作用。在550 C下，Cr6+物种在DHP与CO2反应开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。Cr3+和Cr2+物种可能参与丙烯形成的替代氧化途径。Shishido等人提出，C3H8的氧化脱氢来自Cr6+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原。ZrO2表面上铬物种的拉曼光谱显示，只有两种表面Cr6+物种，没有Cr2O3晶体簇：一种聚集体物种和一种单体物种。xCrAZrO2催化剂的Cr6+/Cr3+比率随着Cr/(Zr + Cr)原子比的增加而增加。7CrAZrO2催化剂上观察到最高的丙烯产量的周转频率（TOF）。在诱导期，聚集体Cr6+物种比单体Cr6+物种更容易还原。诱导期后，只有配位不饱和的聚集体和孤立Cr3+位点存在，它们是CO2-ODHP的主要催化活性位点。孤立Cr3+物种和聚集体Cr3+物种的不同催化性能可以通过它们的不同性质来解释。在原子和分子水平上，7CrAZrO2催化剂的物理化学性质与其CO2-ODHP催化性能之间的基本关系已经建立。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},

"English": "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.", "Chinese": "在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究作为对平衡控制脱氢的替代途径，与商业过程相比，观察到更高的丙烯产量。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品上取得了最佳结果，丙烯的选择性超过80%，丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。对于所有研究的催化剂，都发现了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用。基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度程序反应和H2-TPR实验讨论了二氧化碳的作用。为了在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下提高铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性，应尽可能地实现铬氧化物物种的分散。H2消耗量随Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到6.8 wt% Cr，然后对于Cr含量最高的催化剂，H2消耗量下降。在Cr6.8/MCM-41和Cr13.7/MCM-41样品中，通过XRD检测到a-Cr2O3的形成，并通过UVvis-DRS测量确认。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）的前体。二氧化碳通过两条独立的途径提高了丙烯的产率：涉及二氧化碳作为氧化剂的氧化还原循环和逆水煤气变换反应，该反应去除氢气并使脱氢反应平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。氢气分压的降低使脱氢平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。二氧化碳的促进作用被提出以解释在镓氧化物基催化剂上观察到的高丙烯产率。丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢具有生态影响，因为它代表了化学二氧化碳利用的方法。在这个过程中，二氧化碳被还原为一氧化碳，作为化工行业的反应物更有价值。在所有研究的氧化物催化剂中，基于铬氧化物的支撑材料被认为是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。然而，支撑材料的性质强烈影响铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢性能。在商业上用于轻烷脱氢过程的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂中，催化活性受到二氧化碳的抑制。在CrOx/ZrO2系统中也观察到了二氧化碳的不利影响。然而，在CrOx/SiO2或CrOx/(氧化金刚石)上，二氧化碳对催化剂性能产生了促进作用。因此，最近更多地关注高表面积材料作为分散铬物种的支撑材料。不同的硅质介孔筛，如：MCM-41，SBA-15或MSU-x，由于其高表面积(6001100 m2 g1)，均匀的孔径和相对较高的热稳定性，已被广泛研究。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢时丙烯的高产率。铬氧化物基材料在脱氢和RWGS反应中均具有高催化活性，这与分散的铬物种的存在有关。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种(氧化态较低的Cr2+/Cr3+)的前体。氧化还原机制已被提出用于铬、锰、钒和铁氧化物基催化剂。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在RWGS反应中的高催化活性是观察到的更高丙烯产量的额外原因。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state).

"English": "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species.

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation.

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.

The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Chinese": "文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，不同催化剂和反应条件下的值范围从0.52到1.23 × 105 s-1。对烯烃的选择性通常很高，不同催化剂和进料组成的范围从87%到98%。铬物种的演变受支持物性质的影响，较高负载量会导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，活性较低。铬物种的还原性也取决于支持物，弱金属-支持物相互作用导致还原性增加。支持物上存在羟基对催化剂的分散很重要，而酸性位点由于裂解和焦炭形成而有害。铬物种可以存在于不同的氧化态（Cr3+，Cr4+，Cr5+，Cr6+）和配位环境中，这可能影响催化性能。文献通常认为Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr2O3的负载量和支持物的选择可以影响Cr3+物种的分散性和稳定性，以及支持物的酸性和碱性，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，Cr2O3的较高负载量可能导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，这会降低Cr3+物种的分散性，增加Cr6+物种的形成，而Cr6+物种对脱氢反应的活性较低。支持物还会影响Cr物种的还原性，具有较弱金属-支持物相互作用（MSI）的支持物会导致更容易还原的Cr物种。文献还讨论了CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，它可以作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆向水-气体转换反应从催化剂表面去除氢，从而增加烯烃的产量。然而，CO2也可以与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争，特别是在碱性位点上，这可能对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties.

In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE.

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Chinese": "文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，不同催化剂和反应条件下的值范围从0.52到1.23 × 105 s-1。对烯烃的选择性通常很高，不同催化剂和进料组成的范围从87%到98%。铬物种的演变受支持物性质的影响，较高负载量会导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，活性较低。铬物种的还原性也取决于支持物，弱金属-支持物相互作用导致还原性增加。支持物上存在羟基对催化剂的分散很重要，而酸性位点由于裂解和焦炭形成而有害。铬物种可以存在于不同的氧化态（Cr3+，Cr4+，Cr5+，Cr6+）和配位环境中，这可能影响催化性能。文献通常认为Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr2O3的负载量和支持物的选择可以影响Cr3+物种的分散性和稳定性，以及支持物的酸性和碱性，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，Cr2O3的较高负载量可能导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，这会降低Cr3+物种的分散性，增加Cr6+物种的形成，而Cr6+物种对脱氢反应的活性较低。支持物还会影响Cr物种的还原性，具有较弱金属-支持物相互作用（MSI）的支持物会导致更容易还原的Cr物种。文献还讨论了CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，它可以作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆向水-气体转换反应从催化剂表面去除氢，从而增加烯烃的产量。然而，CO2也可以与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争，特别是在碱性位点上，这可能对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity.

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Chinese": "文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，不同催化剂和反应条件下的值范围从0.52到1.23 × 105 s-1。对烯烃的选择性通常很高，不同催化剂和进料组成的范围从87%到98%。铬物种的演变受支持物性质的影响，较高负载量会导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，活性较低。铬物种的还原性也取决于支持物，弱金属-支持物相互作用导致还原性增加。支持物上存在羟基对催化剂的分散很重要，而酸性位点由于裂解和焦炭形成而有害。铬物种可以存在于不同的氧化态（Cr3+，Cr4+，Cr5+，Cr6+）和配位环境中，这可能影响催化性能。文献通常认为Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr2O3的负载量和支持物的选择可以影响Cr3+物种的分散性和稳定性，以及支持物的酸性和碱性，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，Cr2O3的较高负载量可能导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，这会降低Cr3+物种的分散性，增加Cr6+物种的形成，而Cr6+物种对脱氢反应的活性较低。支持物还会影响Cr物种的还原性，具有较弱金属-支持物相互作用（MSI）的支持物会导致更容易还原的Cr物种。文献还讨论了CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，它可以作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆向水-气体转换反应从催化剂表面去除氢，从而增加烯烃的产量。然而，CO2也可以与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争，特别是在碱性位点上，这可能对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.

The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation.

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.

The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation.

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance.
