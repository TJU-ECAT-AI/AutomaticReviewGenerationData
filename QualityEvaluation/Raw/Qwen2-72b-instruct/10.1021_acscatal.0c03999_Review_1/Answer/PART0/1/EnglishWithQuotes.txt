The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_1"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},

On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_1"},

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions.

The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance.

The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance.

The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},

However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway.

The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts.

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion.

In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},

CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008"},

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst.

The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state).

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion.

In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE.

The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). The redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008"},

The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties.

A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity.

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst.

The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state).

High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr.

{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

"English": "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. To enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2, a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content. The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+). CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41, SBA-15 or MSU-x have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas, uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability. The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+).

The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst.

The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state).

After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014"},

However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr.

The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes provided", "English": "The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},

However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
