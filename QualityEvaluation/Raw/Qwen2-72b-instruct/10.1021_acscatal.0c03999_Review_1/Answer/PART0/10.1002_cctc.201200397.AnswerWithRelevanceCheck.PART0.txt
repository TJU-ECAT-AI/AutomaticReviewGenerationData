          The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state.

The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It does not discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.
