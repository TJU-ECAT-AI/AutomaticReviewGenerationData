          [1] "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none."
          [2] "For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          [3] "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.)."
          [4] "On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading."
          [5] "Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity."
          [6] "(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both."
          [7] "Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          [8] "The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active."
          [9] "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."
          [10] "For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support."
          [11] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."
          [12] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%)."
          [13] "Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2."
          [14] "For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates."
          [15] "To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer."

          The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing the highest activity, in that order. Among the supported metal oxides, Cr2O3 performs best on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and the nature of the support, including textural and acid-base properties. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the evolution of Cr species depends on the loading, following the sequence of grafted Cr6+, dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is typically the threshold for optimal activity. The (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 catalyst with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while higher Cr loadings lead to reduced activity. The activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates, whereas high Cr loadings result in the formation of less active extended polychromate structures. The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, determining the intrinsic activity. For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, with the structural evolution heavily dependent on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性不同，Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3的活性最高，按此顺序排列。在SiO2和Al2O3支持的金属氧化物中，Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面表现最佳。催化性能受金属氧化物分散度、氧化还原性质以及支持物性质（包括纹理和酸碱性质）等因素的影响。在SiO2支持的Cr催化剂上，Cr物种的演变取决于负载量，遵循以下序列：接枝的Cr6+、分散的Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+和结晶α-Cr2O3，随着Cr负载量的增加。Cr单层覆盖度通常是最佳活性的阈值。5 wt. % Cr负载的(Cr2O3)5/SiO2催化剂在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出最佳性能，而更高的Cr负载量会导致活性下降。在(Cr2O3)5/SiO2上的显著活性归因于分散良好的单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐，而高Cr负载量导致形成活性较低的扩展多铬酸盐结构。支持物的性质在影响Cr物种的分散和演变方面起着重要作用，从而决定了内在活性。对于支持的Cr催化剂，较低氧化态（即Cr3+/Cr2+）的Cr物种的生成和分散对于CO2ODHP中实现高C3H6产率至关重要，其结构演变在很大程度上取决于Cr覆盖度和支持物的纹理性质。Cr结构的变异也对Cr负载量敏感，这可以决定活性。Botavina等人制备了一系列Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，Cr负载量范围广泛（0.57.5 wt. %），并达到了与工业过程要求相当的活性（例如，转化率  50%和烯烃  90%）。在支撑材料中，金属氧化物被广泛使用，例如Al2O3、ZrO2、CeO2、TiO2和SiO2。为了更好地分散Cr，有序的介孔材料，如SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41，以及具有可调表面功能基团的碳基载体也是有前景的候选材料。为了阐明载体效应，以下方面已经进行了探索，包括（i）金属-载体相互作用，（ii）在反应物分子的吸附和活化中的酸碱性质，以及（iii）纹理性质及其与Cr物种分散和质量传递的相关性。
