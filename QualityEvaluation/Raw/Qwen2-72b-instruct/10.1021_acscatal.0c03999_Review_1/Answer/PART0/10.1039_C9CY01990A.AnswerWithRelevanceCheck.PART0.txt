          The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effects of Ru loading on the activity and selectivity of a SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) with CO2. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The catalytic behavior of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The origin of the altered catalytic behavior is analyzed using various characterization techniques. The results suggest that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds. The activity and selectivity of Ru for CO2 hydrogenation is sensitive to the structure of the Ru catalyst (metal loading, crystallite size, chemical state). High Ru loading produced methane selectively, while low Ru loading preferred CO production. The crystallite sizes could affect the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: big Ru particles (520 nm) favored methanation pathway, but small Ru particles (13 nm) preferred the RWGS pathway. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, resulting in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst. Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2.

          文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细讨论支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和支撑性质的关系。然而，它确实讨论了Ru负载量对SiO2支撑的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODP)的活性和选择性的影响。1 wt% Ru的最佳催化剂与未改性的铬氧化物催化剂相比，丙烯生产率提高了两倍。较高负载的Ru会导致活性和选择性的降低，这是由于大量吸附的CO2阻碍了丙烷的吸附，以及Ru对丙烯和CO2的重整反应的高活性。这些催化剂的催化行为对Ru负载量非常敏感。催化行为变化的起源通过各种表征技术进行分析。结果表明，少量的Ru有助于激活CO2，并从催化剂表面去除吸附的H2，从而改变直接脱氢反应的平衡，提高其活性，而不会破坏CC键。Ru对CO2氢化的活性和选择性对Ru催化剂的结构(金属负载量、晶粒尺寸、化学状态)敏感。高Ru负载量选择性地产生甲烷，而低Ru负载量更倾向于CO生产。晶粒尺寸可能会影响CO2氢化的选择性：大Ru颗粒(520 nm)倾向于甲烷化路径，而小Ru颗粒(13 nm)更倾向于RWGS路径。C3H8转化率和C3H6生产率随Ru负载量的增加呈现出火山状的活性趋势，1 wt% Ru的最优负载量导致C3H6生产率相比未改性的硅支撑铬氧化物催化剂提高了两倍。少量的Ru促进了C3H8和CO2的活化，并通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，促进了直接脱氢反应的平衡转移。然而，大量的Ru导致C3H8转化率低和C3H6选择性差，这是由于CO2吸附增加和C3H6和CO2的重整反应活性高造成的。
