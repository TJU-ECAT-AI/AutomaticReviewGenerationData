          The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The activity of the catalysts seems to be correlated with more dispersed chromates, and the introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% results in a significant increase in catalyst activity and stability. The features of supported chromium species, including their dispersion and oxidation state, can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. DR UVvis spectroscopy was used to assess the structure-function relationships of these species.

          文件没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细分析影响其催化性能的关键因素。但是，它确实提到，在CO2存在下，C2C4烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，性能最好的是各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上负载的铬，其中SiO2和金刚石负载1.7-8.0 wt% Cr的结果最令人鼓舞。催化剂的活性似乎与更分散的铬酸盐有关，而在反应混合物中引入氧气至5.0 vol.%会导致催化剂活性和稳定性的显著增加。负载的铬物种的特性，包括它们的分散性和氧化态，可能影响催化活性和选择性。使用DR UVvis光谱法评估了这些物种的结构-功能关系。
