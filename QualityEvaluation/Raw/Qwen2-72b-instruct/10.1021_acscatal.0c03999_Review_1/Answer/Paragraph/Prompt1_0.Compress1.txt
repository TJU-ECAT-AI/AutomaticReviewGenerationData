A 6.8 wt% Cr loading maximizes selectivity to propene above 80% and boosts propane conversion from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. CO2 promotes propene yield across all catalysts, acting as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle and in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts equilibrium towards propene.

On SiO2, Cr species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing loading, with a monolayer Cr coverage being optimal. (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 with 5 wt. % Cr loading shows peak performance, attributed to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates. Higher loadings form less active polychromate structures.

The valence of chromium species in ODP reactions with CO2 remains controversial, with fewer operando characterizations, particularly for ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ reduction is more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy reveals CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and these species may contribute to propylene formation. Raman spectra on ZrO2 show polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 clusters.
