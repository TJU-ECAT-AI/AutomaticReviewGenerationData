Chromium loading influences CO2's effect: higher loading on CrOx/SiO2 increases yield ratio in He to CO2, and decreases it on CrOx/Al2O3.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-004-3749-6"},
{"DOC": "In CO2-ODHP, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are the most active, with Ga2O3 leading. Cr2O3 excels on SiO2 and Al2O3 for C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield. Performance hinges on metal oxide dispersion, redox properties, and support characteristics. On SiO2, Cr species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to crystalline α-Cr2O3 with loading. A monolayer Cr coverage is optimal, with (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 at 5 wt. % Cr showing peak performance. Well-dispersed mono- and dichromates are active, whereas extended polychromates are less so. Support nature impacts Cr dispersion and evolution, affecting intrinsic activity. Lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+/Cr2+) are crucial for high C3H6 yield, depending on Cr coverage and support properties. Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with 0.5-7.5 wt. % Cr loading achieve industrial-level activity.

{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts are highly active for CO2-ODHP, outperforming other metal oxides. The valence of chromium species in ODP reactions with CO2 is a subject of debate, with a scarcity of operando studies on ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of polymeric Cr6+ is more catalytically active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy has enhanced understanding of catalysts under reaction conditions. CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at high temperatures, and these species may contribute to propylene formation. Cr6+ and Cr3+ redox is proposed for C3H8 dehydrogenation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed, without Cr2O3 clusters. Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios in xCrAZrO2 increase with Cr loading. 7CrAZrO2 exhibits the highest propylene production TOF. Oligomeric Cr6+ species reduce more easily than monomeric ones. After induction, only unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, being the main active sites for CO2-ODHP. Different properties explain the catalytic performance of isolated and oligomeric Cr3+ species.
