                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel chromium-based catalysts with optimized Cr3+ dispersion and stability, leveraging the synergy between Cr3+ and support properties to enhance CO2-ODHP performance. The role of Cr3+ in redox reactions and its evolution under reaction conditions should be further elucidated to design catalysts with tailored Cr species for improved activity and selectivity. Moreover, the impact of support properties on Cr dispersion and intrinsic activity should be systematically investigated to optimize the catalyst design. Ordered mesoporous supports, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, have shown promise in enhancing Cr dispersion and activity, suggesting that the synthesis of tailored mesoporous materials with optimized textural and acid-base properties could lead to significant performance improvements. The use of in situ spectroscopy to track Cr species evolution under reaction conditions could provide valuable insights into the structure-activity relationships and guide the rational design of catalysts. Additionally, the exploration of alternative metal oxides and the development of bimetallic catalysts could offer new avenues for enhancing CO2-ODHP performance. The synergistic effects of different metal oxides and the role of secondary metals in promoting Cr3+ dispersion and stability should be systematically studied. The optimization of Cr loading and support properties, as well as the investigation of the effects of reaction conditions on Cr species evolution, are crucial for the development of efficient and stable CO2-ODHP catalysts. The potential of CO2 as a mild oxidant in CO2-ODHP should also be further explored, as it can enhance alkene yields and shift the equilibrium towards propene formation. The development of catalysts with enhanced CO2 activation and RWGS activity could lead to improved CO2-ODHP performance and higher propene yields. The integration of CO2-ODHP with other processes, such as steam reforming or reverse water-gas shift, could also offer opportunities for the valorization of CO2 and the production of value-added chemicals. The design of multifunctional catalysts with optimized Cr species and support properties, as well as the exploration of novel reaction pathways and conditions, are key areas for future research in CO2-ODHP.
