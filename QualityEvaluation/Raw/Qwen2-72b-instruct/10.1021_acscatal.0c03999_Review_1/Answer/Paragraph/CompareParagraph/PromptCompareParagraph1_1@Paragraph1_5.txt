Comprehensive evaluation of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP: From initial screening to in-depth analysis of chromium-based catalysts, focusing on performance factors, species evolution, and structure-activity relationships. CrOx/silica excels in CO2-ODHP, with Cr3+ being vital for activity [\[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]]. Ni boosts stability and selectivity by facilitating the regeneration of Cr3+ from Cr2+ [\[10.1002/cctc.201200397\]]. Chromium species' evolution in Cr2O3 is influenced by loading and support properties, impacting catalytic performance [\[10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017\]]. Cr and Ga oxides lead in CO2-ODHP, with CO2 boosting propene yield via Cr oxides [\[10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.040\]]. Redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+) are vital, influenced by Cr loading, preparation, precursor, and support [\[10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.040\]]. Cr2O3 catalysts optimized at 5 wt.% Cr excel in CO2-ODHP; higher Cr loads form Cr2O3 phase, blocking pores [\[10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017\]]. Active carbon and CO2 stabilize surface groups, enhancing propane dehydrogenation [\[10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017\]]. Chromium species' evolution, by loading and support, boosts propane dehydrogenation [\[10.1016/j.tca.2008.02.017\]]. Cr2O3 catalysts at 6.0 wt% Cr loading for CO2-ODHP yield high propene (69%) via chromate species; higher loadings introduce inactive -Cr2O3, reducing activity [\[10.1016/j.cej.2010.11.070\]].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts with tailored Cr species for enhanced CO2-ODHP performance. The role of support properties in the evolution of Cr species and the impact on catalytic activity could be further elucidated. Additionally, the investigation of synergistic effects between Cr and other metals, such as Ni, could provide insights into improving stability and selectivity. The optimization of Cr loading and the exploration of new support materials with high surface area and tailored acidity could also be promising directions for future research. The understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Cr-based catalysts will be crucial for the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP.
