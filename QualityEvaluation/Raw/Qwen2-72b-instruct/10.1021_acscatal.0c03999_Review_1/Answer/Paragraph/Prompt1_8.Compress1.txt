CO2 promotes propene yield across all studied catalysts, acting as an oxidizing agent in a redox cycle and facilitating the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the equilibrium toward propene. The dispersion of chromium oxide species is crucial for enhanced activity in both CO2 presence and absence. H2 consumption peaks at 6.8 wt% Cr loading, correlating with the formation of a-Cr2O3 in Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 samples, confirmed by XRD and UVvis-DRS. Cr6+ species on MCM-41 surfaces evolve into catalytically active Cr2+/Cr3+ species. The role of CO2 in promoting propene yield is explained by its interaction with hydrogen, reducing its partial pressure and shifting the equilibrium. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, especially on high surface area materials like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x, are most promising due to their high activity. The dispersed Cr species are primarily responsible for high propene yields, with the redox mechanism applicable to chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide catalysts.
