The valence of chromium species in ODP reactions with CO2 is a subject of debate, particularly for ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduced polymeric Cr6+ is more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy reveals CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and Cr3+ and Cr2+ may facilitate propylene formation. Shishido et al. suggest C3H8 dehydrogenation involves Cr6+ and Cr3+ redox. Raman spectra on ZrO2 show polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 increases with Cr loading, and 7CrAZrO2 exhibits the highest TOF for propylene.
