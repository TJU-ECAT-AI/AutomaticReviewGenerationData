Species evolution in Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by loading and support, with higher loadings leading to less active, larger Cr2O3 crystallites.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, prepared by DHT and TIE, exhibit distinct chromium species affecting CO2-ODHP catalytic properties. DHT yields monochromate species, while TIE results in a mix of monochromates and polychromates, both achieving >90% propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation, enhanced by CO2. Chromate species reduce to Cr(III) during reactions, with DHT-prepared samples showing higher formaldehyde selectivity in methane partial oxidation, attributed to the high dispersion of stable monochromate species.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxides are highly active for CO2-ODHP among metal oxide catalysts, with ongoing debate over the valence of chromium species in ODP reactions, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduced polymeric Cr6+ is more catalytically active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy on Cr/SBA-1 reveals CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and Cr3+ and Cr2+ may facilitate propylene formation. Shishido et al. suggest C3H8 dehydrogenation involves Cr6+ and Cr3+ redox. Raman spectra on ZrO2 show polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 increases with Cr loading, and 7CrAZrO2 exhibits the highest TOF for propylene. After induction, only unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, being the main active sites.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst achieves 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity, attributed to inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles in TUD-1's porous silica structure.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
