An optimal 1 wt% Ru loading doubles the propylene production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst. Higher Ru loadings decrease activity and selectivity due to CO2 adsorption blocking propane adsorption and high Ru activity for propylene and CO2 reforming. A small amount of Ru activates CO2, removes adsorbed H2, and shifts the equilibrium of direct dehydrogenation, enhancing activity without breaking CC bonds.

H2 consumption peaks at 6.8 wt% Cr then declines. a-Cr2O3 forms in Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41, confirmed by XRD and UVvis-DRS. Cr6+ on MCM-41 surfaces evolves into catalytically active Cr2+/Cr3+. CO2's dual pathway effect and hydrogen pressure reduction explain high propene yields over gallium oxide catalysts. Supported chromium oxides are most promising due to high activity, influenced by support type. CO2 inhibits activity in CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2, but promotes it in CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). High surface area supports, like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x, enhance chromium dispersion. Dispersed Cr species are key for high propene yield in CO2-ODHP. High activity in RWGS and dehydrogenation is linked to dispersed Cr species.
