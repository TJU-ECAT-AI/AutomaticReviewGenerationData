{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts excel in CO2-ODHP, surpassing alternatives. The valence of Cr species in ODP reactions with CO2 is contentious, lacking operando characterizations, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts. Reduced Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ is more active. CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding activation. Cr6+ swiftly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, contributing to propylene formation. Cr6+ and Cr3+ redox is proposed for C3H8 dehydrogenation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are seen. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 rises with Cr loading. 7CrAZrO2 has the highest propylene TOF. Oligomeric Cr6+ species reduce more readily.
