Increasing Cr loading on MCM-41-DHT reduces pore volume and surface area, yet keeps pore diameter stable. Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination converts to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination post-reaction, highlighting Cr's role as the active site. This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is pivotal for C3H8 dehydrogenation with CO2. After O2 treatment, Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerate, correlating with the catalyst's reactivation.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
{"DOC": "Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP, achieving 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Lower Cr loading favors Cr species with higher oxidation states, enhancing performance, while higher loading leads to bulk Cr2O3 formation. Active sites and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x support are pivotal for optimal catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2006.08.005"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 outperforms other M-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, achieving 65% styrene conversion and 90% selectivity. Styrene formation peaks at 1.7 wt.% Cr loading, linked to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedral monochromate species that reduce to less active Cr(III)O6 octahedral polychromates. CO2 partial pressure boosts CO and styrene formation rates. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41 involves direct oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift reaction.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2004.12.006"},
{"DOC": "A study on SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that 1 wt% Ru loading optimally enhances propylene production by 2x compared to unmodified catalysts. Higher Ru loadings decrease activity and selectivity due to CO2 adsorption blocking propane and high reforming activity. C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production show a volcano-shaped trend with Ru loading, peaking at 1 wt% with a 2x C3H6 production rate increase. Small Ru amounts promote C3H8 and CO2 activation, facilitating equilibrium shift by removing adsorbed H2 through reverse water-gas shift.", "Doi": "10.1039/C9CY01990A"},
{"DOC": "Cr2O3/SBA-1 catalysts exhibit varying activity for CO2-ODHP based on Cr loading. Dispersed Cr5+ species, present at loadings below 7 wt.%, are highly active for propane dehydrogenation. Crystalline Cr2O3 forms at loadings above 5 wt.%, reducing activity. Maximum propane conversion (37.7%) is achieved at 7 wt.% Cr loading. Cr6+ species, rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ during the reaction, are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. Beyond 7 wt.% Cr loading, conversion remains constant due to inactive Cr2O3 formation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.05.011"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior performance in CO2-ODHP, achieving 30% propane conversion to propene with 90% selectivity. Monochromate species are prevalent in DHT-prepared Cr-MCM-41, while polychromates coexist in TIE-prepared samples. During propane dehydrogenation, chromate species reduce to Cr(III) octahedra. Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra reduce to Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which can be reoxidized by CO2, facilitating a crucial reduction-oxidation cycle for the reaction.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014"},

High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are essential for optimal performance. Mesoporous supports like MCM-41 and SBA-1 enhance dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species. The number of redox Cr sites correlates with propene yield, peaking at 2 wt % Cr loading. Dealumination of Beta zeolite followed by chromium dispersion yields excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, chromium-supported catalysts on oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond exhibit superior performance, particularly SiO2 and diamond at moderate Cr loadings.

{"DOC": "Cr and Ga catalysts excel in CO2-ODHP. Cr/silica's activity is shaped by Cr's oxidation states, species structure, and interaction with silica, influenced by precursor type, calcination temperature, Cr content, and silica properties. Cr6+ species, as mono- and polychromates, are active below monolayer coverage. Exceeding this leads to -Cr2O3 formation, which, though stable, hinders catalytic activity by limiting Cr atom accessibility and resisting hydrogen and oxygen.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP exhibit activity (0.52-1.23 × 105 s-1) and olefin selectivity (87%-98%). Chromium species evolve with support properties and loading, affecting activity; higher loadings decrease Cr3+ dispersion, increase Cr6+, and reduce reducibility. Acid sites promote cracking and coke formation, while hydroxyl groups enhance dispersion. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, boosting alkene yields but competing for adsorption sites.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, prepared by DHT and TIE methods, exhibit distinct chromium species impacting catalytic properties in CO2-ODHP. DHT-prepared samples predominantly feature monochromate species, while TIE samples contain both monochromates and polychromates. Both methods yield high propylene selectivity (>90%) in propane dehydrogenation, enhanced by CO2. Chromate species reduce to Cr(III) during reactions. In methane partial oxidation, DHT samples show higher formaldehyde selectivity, attributed to the high dispersion of stable monochromate species.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts are highly active for CO2-ODHP, with the valence of chromium species remaining a subject of debate. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ reduction is more catalytically active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy on Cr/SBA-1 reveals CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and Cr3+ and Cr2+ may facilitate propylene formation. After the induction period, only unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, being the main active sites. The catalytic performance of 7CrAZrO2 for CO2-ODHP is fundamentally related to its physicochemical properties at the atomic and molecular level, achieving the highest TOF for propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
