A 6.8 wt% Cr loading maximizes propene selectivity above 80% and boosts propane conversion from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. CO2 promotes propene yield through two pathways: a redox cycle where CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the equilibrium toward propene. Chromium dispersion is critical for activity in CO2-ODHP, with H2 consumption peaking at 6.8 wt% Cr before declining. The role of CO2 is elucidated by temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. High surface area supports, like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x, enhance chromium dispersion, affecting catalyst performance.

Small Ru amounts promote C3H8 and CO2 activation, facilitating direct dehydrogenation equilibrium shift by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The valence of Cr species in ODP with CO2 remains controversial, with fewer operando characterizations, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ reduction is more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy reveals CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and these species may participate in propylene formation. The redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ is proposed for C3H8 dehydrogenation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed, without Cr2O3 clusters. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio increases with Cr loading. 7CrAZrO2 exhibits the highest TOF for propylene.
