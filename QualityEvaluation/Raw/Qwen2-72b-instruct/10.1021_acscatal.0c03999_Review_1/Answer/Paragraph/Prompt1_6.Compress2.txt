{"DOC": "In CO2-ODHP, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 are the most active metal oxide catalysts, with Cr2O3 excelling on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports for C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield. On SiO2, Cr species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing loading, peaking at a monolayer Cr coverage. (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr) shows optimal performance, with higher loadings leading to less active polychromate structures. The nature of the support affects Cr species dispersion and evolution, impacting intrinsic activity. Cr3+/Cr2+ species are crucial for high C3H6 yield, with structural evolution dependent on Cr coverage and support properties.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_1"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 excels in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, achieving over 15% yield and 90% selectivity for propene. Increasing Cr loading linearly enhances C3H8 conversion, underscoring Cr's active role. Post-reaction, Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination transforms to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination, regenerating via reoxidation after O2 treatment. This cycle is critical for C3H8 dehydrogenation with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41, with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ playing a key role.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
{"DOC": "Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit high activity in CO2-ODHP, achieving 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Lower Cr loading favors higher oxidation state species, whereas higher loading results in bulk Cr2O3. Active sites and the promoting effect of MSU-x support are critical, highlighting the role of Cr species evolution and support properties in catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2006.08.005"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 outperformed other M-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, achieving 65% styrene conversion and over 90% selectivity. Styrene formation rates increased with Cr loading, peaking at 1.7 wt.%, attributed to Cr(VI)O4 monochromate species that reduce to less active Cr(III)O6 polychromates. Deactivated Cr-MCM-41 regenerates through oxygen or CO2 treatment, reoxidizing Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4. Monochromate species on Cr-MCM-41 reduce to aggregated Cr(III) during reactions. CO2 partial pressure boosts CO formation rates while decreasing H2 formation, with reverse water-gas shift reaction confirmed to influence CO formation during ethylbenzene dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2004.12.006"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst modified with 1 wt% Ru doubles propylene production compared to the unmodified catalyst. Higher Ru loadings decrease activity and selectivity due to excessive CO2 adsorption, which blocks propane adsorption and promotes high reforming activity. Optimal catalytic behavior is sensitive to Ru loading, with small amounts enhancing CO2 activation and shifting the equilibrium of direct dehydrogenation. Ru structure affects CO2 hydrogenation selectivity: low loading favors CO production, while high loading selectively produces methane. C3H8 conversion and C3H6 production rate peak at 1 wt% Ru, doubling C3H6 production. Small Ru amounts promote C3H8 and CO2 activation, facilitating equilibrium shift through reverse water-gas shift, whereas large amounts result in low C3H8 conversion and poor C3H6 selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1039/C9CY01990A"},
{"DOC": "Cr2O3/SBA-1 catalysts show variable activity for CO2-ODHP based on Cr loading. Dispersed Cr5+ species, found at loadings <7 wt.%, are highly active. Crystalline Cr2O3 forms at >5 wt.% loading, reducing activity. Cr6+ species reduce to Cr2+/Cr3+ during the reaction, becoming active sites. Max propane conversion (37.7%) is at 7 wt.% Cr, plateauing at higher loadings due to inactive Cr2O3.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2012.05.011"},

Crucially, Cr(III)O6 can be reoxidized by CO2, enabling a redox cycle vital for the reaction over Cr-MCM-41.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts, featuring Cr(II) or Cr(III) species, excel in CO2-ODHP due to high dispersion and redox properties, enhanced by mesoporous supports like MCM-41.

{"DOC": "Cr and Ga catalysts excel in CO2-ODHP activity and selectivity. Cr/silica catalyst efficacy hinges on Cr oxidation states, species structure, and Cr-silica interaction, modulated by Cr precursor, calcination conditions, Cr loading, and silica properties. Below monolayer coverage, Cr6+ species, as mono- and polychromates, act as active sites. Exceeding this coverage fosters -Cr2O3 formation, which, while thermodynamically stable, diminishes catalytic activity by limiting Cr accessibility and resisting hydrogen and oxygen.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "In CO2-ODHP, Cr2O3 catalysts' performance is governed by Cr species evolution, support properties, and CO2's dual role. Higher Cr loadings yield less active crystallites, while support properties affect Cr reducibility and dispersion. Acid sites can cause cracking and coke formation, whereas hydroxyl groups aid dispersion. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to enhance alkene yields but competes for adsorption sites, impacting performance.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "A study on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by DHT and TIE shows that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species significantly influence catalytic properties in CO2-ODHP. DHT-prepared samples, dominated by monochromate species, and TIE samples, featuring a mix of monochromates and polychromates, both exhibit high propylene selectivity (>90%) and enhanced propane conversion due to CO2 presence. Chromate species reduce to Cr(III) during propane dehydrogenation. In methane partial oxidation, DHT samples show higher formaldehyde selectivity, possibly due to the high dispersion of monochromate species, which remains unchanged during the reaction.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxides exhibit high activity for CO2-ODHP among metal oxide catalysts, with the valence of chromium species in ODP with CO2 being a subject of debate, particularly for ZrO2-based catalysts. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduced polymeric Cr6+ is more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy reveals CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, and Cr3+ and Cr2+ may form propylene via an alternative pathway. The redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species drives C3H8 dehydrogenation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed, with the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 rising with Cr loading. 7CrAZrO2 exhibits the highest TOF for propylene. After induction, only unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, being the main active sites. The catalytic performance of Cr3+ species is explained by their properties, establishing a fundamental relationship between 7CrAZrO2's physicochemical properties and CO2-ODHP catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst excels in CO2-ODHP, achieving 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity.
