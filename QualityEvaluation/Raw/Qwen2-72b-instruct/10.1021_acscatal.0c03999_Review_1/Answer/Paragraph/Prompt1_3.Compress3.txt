{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, excels with 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. Its high performance is attributed to the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in TUD-1's porous silica structure.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
