(Cr2O3)5/SiO2 shows peak performance, while high Cr loadings form less active polychromate structures. The support's nature affects Cr species dispersion and evolution, impacting intrinsic activity. Cr3+/Cr2+ species are crucial for high C3H6 yield, depending on Cr coverage and support properties. Metal oxides and ordered mesoporous materials are promising supports for Cr dispersion.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_1"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated superior activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, achieving over 15% yield and 90% selectivity for propene. Increasing Cr content linearly enhanced C3H8 conversion, highlighting Cr's active role. Post-reaction, chromium species transitioned from Cr6+ in tetrahedral to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination, regenerating Cr6+O4 tetrahedra upon O2 treatment. This reduction-oxidation cycle is crucial for C3H8 dehydrogenation with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41, where Cr6+ tetrahedrally coordinated plays a pivotal role.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
{"DOC": "Cr/MSU-x catalysts excel in CO2-ODHP, achieving 36.8% propane conversion and 89.1% propylene selectivity. Lower Cr loading favors higher oxidation state species, while higher loading promotes bulk Cr2O3.

{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 outperforms other M-MCM-41 catalysts in CO2-ODHP, achieving 65% styrene conversion and 90% selectivity. Styrene formation peaks at 1.7 wt.% Cr loading, linked to Cr(VI)O4 monochromate species that reduce to less active Cr(III)O6 polychromates. Oxygen or CO2 treatment regenerates deactivated catalysts by reoxidizing Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4. Monochromate species on Cr-MCM-41 reduce to aggregated Cr(III) during dehydrogenation. CO2 pressure boosts CO formation rates while diminishing H2 formation. Reverse water-gas shift reaction is confirmed, influencing CO formation through parallel direct oxidative dehydrogenation and thermodynamically assisted dehydrogenation reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2004.12.006"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst modified with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold increase in propylene production rate compared to unmodified Cr2O3. Optimal performance was observed at this Ru loading, enhancing C3H6 production. Larger Ru loadings led to poor C3H6 selectivity due to increased CO2 adsorption. Ru loading influenced CO2 hydrogenation selectivity, with high loadings favoring methane and low loadings preferring CO production. Crystallite size affected CO2 hydrogenation selectivity, with larger particles favoring methanation and smaller ones preferring the RWGS pathway.", "Doi": "10.1039/C9CY01990A"},

{"DOC": "Cr and Ga catalysts excel in CO2-ODHP activity and selectivity. Cr/silica catalytic performance hinges on Cr oxidation states, species structure, and Cr-silica interaction, influenced by precursor type, calcination temperature, Cr content, and silica properties. Below monolayer coverage, Cr6+ species, as monochromates and polychromates, act as active sites. Exceeding this coverage leads to amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 formation, negatively impacting activity due to reduced Cr atom accessibility and resistance to hydrogen and oxygen.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "Cr2O3 catalysts' activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP are influenced by chromium species evolution, which depends on loading and support properties. Higher loadings result in larger Cr2O3 crystallites, reducing dispersion and activity. Weak metal-support interaction enhances Cr reducibility, while hydroxyl groups improve dispersion. Acid sites promote cracking and coke formation. Cr3+ species are active for dehydrogenation, with dispersion and stability affected by loading and support acidity/basicity. Higher loadings decrease Cr3+ dispersion and increase less active Cr6+ species. Supports with weak metal-support interaction increase Cr reducibility.

Both methods show >90% selectivity to propylene, enhanced by CO2. During propane dehydrogenation, chromate species reduce to Cr(III). In methane partial oxidation, DHT-prepared samples exhibit higher selectivity to formaldehyde, attributed to the high dispersion and stability of monochromate species during the reaction.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts are highly active for CO2-ODHP, with coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, derived from polymeric Cr6+, being more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy on Cr/SBA-1 reveals CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+, with surface carboxylates aiding CO2 activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, potentially facilitating propylene formation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 increases with Cr loading, with 7CrAZrO2 showing the highest propylene production TOF. After the induction period, only unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, acting as the main active sites.
