Cr species' evolution, influenced by loading and support properties, is critical for activity, with higher Cr2O3 loadings leading to less active, larger crystallites. Weak metal-support interaction enhances reducibility, while hydroxyl groups improve dispersion. Acid sites cause cracking and coke formation. Cr3+ species are active for dehydrogenation, with loading and support affecting their dispersion and stability. Higher loadings decrease Cr3+ dispersion and increase less active Cr6+. Support with weak MSI facilitates more reducible Cr species. CO2 boosts alkene yields but competes for adsorption sites, impacting performance.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "In CO2-ODHP, Cr-MCM-41 catalysts' performance is influenced by the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species. DHT-prepared catalysts, rich in monochromate species, show higher selectivity to formaldehyde in methane partial oxidation compared to TIE-prepared catalysts, which contain both monochromates and polychromates. Both exhibit high selectivity (>90%) to propylene in propane dehydrogenation with CO2, enhancing propane conversion. Chromate species reduce to Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during reactions, maintaining high dispersion in DHT-prepared samples, which is critical for selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxides exhibit high activity for CO2-ODHP, with Cr3+ species from polymeric Cr6+ reduction being more active than isolated Cr6+. CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, with surface carboxylates aiding activation. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, contributing to propylene formation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed, with Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios increasing with Cr loading. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst shows the highest TOF for propylene. After the induction period, unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain as the main active sites. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst's physicochemical properties fundamentally relate to its CO2-ODHP performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, excels with 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. Its high performance is attributed to the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the dispersion of chromium nanoparticles in TUD-1's porous silica structure, as characterized.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
