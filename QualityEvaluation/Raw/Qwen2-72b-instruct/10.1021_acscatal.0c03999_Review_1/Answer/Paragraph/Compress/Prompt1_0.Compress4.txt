{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts, with Cr(II) and Cr(III) species, are active and selective for CO2-PDH. High dispersion and redox properties, enhanced by supports like MCM-41 and Beta zeolite, are crucial. Dealumination of Beta zeolite improves chromium dispersion. The number of redox Cr sites correlates with propene yield, peaking at 2 wt % Cr loading, highlighting the importance of species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, chromium catalysts on SiO2 and diamond show superior performance, with activity linked to more dispersed chromates. Oxygen introduction boosts activity and stability. DR UVvis spectroscopy reveals that the dispersion and oxidation state of supported chromium species significantly impact catalytic activity and selectivity, elucidating structure-function relationships.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.05.037"},
{"DOC": "Cr and Ga materials show high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. Cr/silica catalysts' performance is influenced by Cr oxidation states, species structure, and Cr-silica interaction. Cr6+ species, dominant below monolayer coverage, are active sites. Exceeding this coverage leads to the formation of amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3, which is thermodynamically stable but hinders activity due to inaccessible Cr atoms and resistance to hydrogen and oxygen, rendering it an ineffective catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2011.08.019"},
{"DOC": "Cr-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP exhibit high olefin selectivity and activity. Higher Cr2O3 loadings lead to larger, less active crystallites. Cr3+ species, essential for dehydrogenation, have their dispersion and stability influenced by loading and support choice. Support properties, including acidic and basic sites, impact performance by affecting adsorption and promoting cracking or coke formation. CO2's role as a mild oxidant enhances alkene yields but competes for adsorption sites, affecting catalyst efficiency.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, synthesized via DHT and TIE, exhibit distinct properties in CO2-ODHP. DHT-prepared samples, with high dispersion of monochromate species, show higher formaldehyde selectivity in methane partial oxidation and maintain stability. TIE-prepared samples, containing a mix of monochromate and polychromate species, display high propylene selectivity (>90%) in propane dehydrogenation, enhanced by CO2. Chromate species reduce to Cr(III) during reactions, affecting catalytic performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit high activity for CO2-ODHP, with coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from reduced Cr6+ being more active than isolated Cr6+. Surface carboxylates facilitate CO2 activation by oxidizing Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+. Rapid reduction of Cr6+ to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C aids propylene formation. On ZrO2, polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed, with the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio increasing with Cr loading. After the induction period, unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, correlating with the catalytic performance of 7CrAZrO2.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, excels with 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. Its performance is attributed to the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in TUD-1's porous silica structure, enhancing catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
