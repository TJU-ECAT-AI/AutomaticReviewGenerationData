Chromium dispersion is critical for activity, with H2 consumption peaking at 6.8 wt% Cr. a-Cr2O3 forms in Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41, confirmed by XRD and UVvis-DRS. Cr6+ on MCM-41 surfaces evolves into catalytically active Cr2+/Cr3+. CO2's dual pathway effect enhances propene yield in all catalysts. The reduction of hydrogen pressure shifts equilibrium towards propene. Chromium oxide catalysts are most promising due to high activity, influenced by support properties. CO2's effect varies: inhibiting CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2, but promoting CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). High surface area supports like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x are favored for chromium dispersion. Dispersed Cr species are key to high propene yield, with high catalytic activity in dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions linked to these species. The redox mechanism applies to chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide catalysts. MCM-41-supported chromium oxide's high RWGS activity boosts propene yield.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008"},
