As loading increases, Cr species evolve from grafted Cr6+ to crystalline α-Cr2O3, as seen in (Cr2O3)5/SiO2, which exhibits peak activity due to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates. Higher loadings result in less active polychromate structures. Support properties, including textural and acid-base characteristics, significantly influence Cr dispersion and species evolution, impacting catalytic activity.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_1"},
{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 outperforms other metal oxides in CO2-ODHP, achieving 15% propene yield with 90% selectivity. Increasing Cr loading enhances C3H8 conversion, underscoring Cr's active role. Post-reaction, Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination reversibly transforms to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination, a critical step for dehydrogenation. This cycle, where Cr6+O4 tetrahedra dehydrogenate C3H8 to C3H6, reducing to Cr3+Og octahedra, which reoxidize via CO2, is essential for the reaction. O2 treatment regenerates Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, correlating with reactivation, as evidenced by XANES and EXAFS spectra.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},

{"DOC": "Cr and Ga catalysts are top performers in CO2-ODHP, with Cr/silica's activity hinging on Cr's oxidation states, species structure, and interaction with silica. At sub-monolayer coverage, Cr6+ species, notably as mono- and polychromates, serve as active sites. Exceeding this coverage leads to the formation of amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3, which sequesters Cr atoms and diminishes activity.
