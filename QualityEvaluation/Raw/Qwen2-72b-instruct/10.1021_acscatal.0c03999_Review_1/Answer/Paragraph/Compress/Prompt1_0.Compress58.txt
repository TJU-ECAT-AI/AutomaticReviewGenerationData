{"DOC": "Cr-MCM-41 excels in CO2-ODHP, achieving 65% styrene conversion and 90% selectivity. Cr(VI)O4 acts as an active monochromate species, converting to less active Cr(III)O6 during reactions. Deactivation is reversible, with Cr(III)O6 reoxidizing to Cr(VI)O4 upon treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2. Increasing CO2 partial pressure boosts CO formation rate, indicating parallel reverse water-gas shift and direct oxidative dehydrogenation reactions over Cr-MCM-41, confirming its catalytic versatility and the role of chromium species in activity modulation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.molcata.2004.12.006"},

At sub-monolayer coverage, Cr6+ species as mono- and polychromates act as active sites.
