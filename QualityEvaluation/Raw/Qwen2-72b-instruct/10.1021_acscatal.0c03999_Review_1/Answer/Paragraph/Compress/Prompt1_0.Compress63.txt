This cycle, where Cr6+O4 tetrahedra dehydrogenate C3H8 to C3H6, reducing to Cr3+Og octahedra, which reoxidize via CO2, is essential for the reaction. O2 treatment regenerates Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, correlating with reactivation, as evidenced by XANES and EXAFS spectra.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
