This species evolution, with Cr6+O4 tetrahedra dehydrogenating C3H8 to C3H6 and being reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra, is pivotal. Reduced Cr3+Og octahedra reoxidize via CO2, completing the essential cycle. After O2 treatment, Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerate, correlating with reactivation.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4"},
