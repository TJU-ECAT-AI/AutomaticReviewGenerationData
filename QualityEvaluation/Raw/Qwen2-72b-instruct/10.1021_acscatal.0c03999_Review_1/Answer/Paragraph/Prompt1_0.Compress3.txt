In methane partial oxidation, DHT-prepared samples exhibit higher selectivity to formaldehyde, attributed to the high dispersion and stability of monochromate species.", "Doi": "10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00278-1"},
{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts outperform alternatives in CO2-ODHP, with the valence of Cr species in ODP reactions with CO2 being a contentious issue, particularly lacking operando characterizations for ZrO2-based catalysts. Reduced Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ exhibits higher activity. CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ on Cr/SBA-1, facilitated by surface carboxylates. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, contributing to propylene formation. Cr6+ and Cr3+ redox is proposed for C3H8 dehydrogenation. On ZrO2, only polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species are observed. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 increases with Cr loading. 7CrAZrO2 achieves the highest propylene turnover frequency (TOF). Oligomeric Cr6+ species reduce more readily. After induction, unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are crucial for CO2-ODHP. Cr3+ species' properties significantly impact catalytic performance, establishing a fundamental relationship between 7CrAZrO2's properties and CO2-ODHP performance.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, excels with 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. Its performance is attributed to the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles within TUD-1's porous silica structure, as revealed by characterization techniques.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
