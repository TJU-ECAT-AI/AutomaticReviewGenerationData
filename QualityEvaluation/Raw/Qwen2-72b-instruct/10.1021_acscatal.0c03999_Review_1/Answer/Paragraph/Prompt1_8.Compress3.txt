{"DOC": "Chromium oxides are highly active in CO2-ODHP, with coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from polymeric Cr6+ reduction being more active than isolated Cr6+. In situ spectroscopy on Cr/SBA-1 reveals CO2 oxidizes Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+, facilitated by surface carboxylates. Cr6+ rapidly reduces to Cr2+/Cr3+ at 550°C, potentially aiding propylene formation through an alternative oxidative pathway. ZrO2-based catalysts exhibit polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 clusters. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCrAZrO2 increases with Cr loading, with 7CrAZrO2 achieving the highest TOF for propylene. After the induction period, coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main active sites for CO2-ODHP.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026"},
{"DOC": "For CO2-ODHP, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, achieves 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. Its high performance is attributed to the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the dispersion of chromium nanoparticles in TUD-1's porous silica structure, highlighting the significance of chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3"}
