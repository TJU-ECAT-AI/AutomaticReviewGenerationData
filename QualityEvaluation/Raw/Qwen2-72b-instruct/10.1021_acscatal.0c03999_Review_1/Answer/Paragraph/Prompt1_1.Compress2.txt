CO2 universally boosts propene yield through a redox cycle and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, enhancing hydrogen removal and shifting equilibrium. Chromium dispersion is crucial for activity enhancement. a-Cr2O3 forms in Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41. Cr6+ on MCM-41 surfaces evolves into catalytically active Cr2+/Cr3+. CO2's dual pathway effect explains high propene yields over gallium oxide catalysts. The process converts CO2 to CO, offering ecological benefits. Chromium oxide catalysts are most promising due to high activity, influenced by support properties. High surface area supports, like MCM-41, enhance chromium dispersion. Dispersed Cr species are key for high propene yield. The redox mechanism applies to chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxides.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2008.07.008"},
