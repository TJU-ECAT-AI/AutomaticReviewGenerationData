1.The study compares the performance of Cr/MSU-x catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. The results showed that lower Cr loading leads to the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, while higher Cr loading results in the formation of bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals on the catalyst surface. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are influenced by the loading of Cr and the properties of the mesoporous MSU-x support. The Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibited excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% and a propylene selectivity of 89.1%.

1.该研究比较了Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2存在下将丙烷脱氢为丙烯的性能。催化剂使用X射线衍射、漫反射UVvis和H2-温度程序还原技术进行了表征。结果表明，较低的Cr负载会导致形成具有较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的Cr负载会导致催化剂表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。催化剂的活性和选择性受Cr负载量和介孔MSU-x载体性质的影响。Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的活性，实现了36.8%的丙烷转化率和89.1%的丙烯选择性。
