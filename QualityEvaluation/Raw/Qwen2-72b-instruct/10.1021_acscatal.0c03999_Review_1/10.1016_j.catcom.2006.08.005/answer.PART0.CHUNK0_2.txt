1.The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP are not directly compared in the literature. However, the Cr/MSU-x catalyst shows excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% and a propylene selectivity of 89.1%. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is discussed. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, while higher Cr loading leads to the formation of bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals on the catalyst surface. The mesoporous MSU-x support has a promoting effect on the catalytic activity.

1.文献中没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。然而，Cr/MSU-x催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢制丙烯方面表现出优异的性能，丙烷转化率为36.8%，丙烯选择性为89.1%。讨论了负载和载体性质对负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演化的功能依赖性。较低的Cr负载导致形成具有较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的Cr负载则导致催化剂表面形成块状Cr2O3晶体。介孔MSU-x载体对催化活性有促进作用。
