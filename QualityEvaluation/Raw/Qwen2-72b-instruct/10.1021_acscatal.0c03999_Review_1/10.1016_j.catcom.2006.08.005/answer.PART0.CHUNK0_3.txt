[1] "Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques."
[2] "Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained."
[3] "Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface."

1.The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP is not provided in the literature. However, the literature does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Lower Cr loading results in the formation of Cr species with a higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on the catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving 36.8% propane conversion with 89.1% propylene selectivity.

1.文献中没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP活性和选择性方面的比较。但是，文献确实讨论了负载和载体性质对支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演化的功能。较低的Cr负载导致形成具有较高氧化态的Cr物种，而较高的Cr负载导致催化剂表面形成块状铬氧化物(Cr2O3)晶体。还讨论了催化剂的活性位点和介孔MSU-x作为载体的促进作用。Cr/MSU-x催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出优异的活性，实现了36.8%的丙烷转化率和89.1%的丙烯选择性。
