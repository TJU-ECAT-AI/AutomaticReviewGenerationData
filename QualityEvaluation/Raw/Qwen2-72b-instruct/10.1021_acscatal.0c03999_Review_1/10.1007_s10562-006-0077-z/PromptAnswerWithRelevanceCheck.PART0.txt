Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. However, it does state that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides. Chromium oxide deposition on b-Ga2O3 enhances resistance to coke deposition, possibly due to decreased surface acidity. The effect of chromium loading and support properties on the evolution of chromium species is not explicitly discussed.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实指出，b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物材料在丙烷脱氢中是活性和选择性的。高催化活性归因于镓和铬氧化物的脱氢性质。铬氧化物在b-Ga2O3上的沉积增强了对焦炭沉积的抵抗力，这可能是由于表面酸度降低。没有明确讨论铬的负载和支持物性质对支持的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响。

Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition, which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is suggested that deposition of chromium oxide generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process.
