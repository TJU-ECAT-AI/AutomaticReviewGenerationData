1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex and involves the participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species in non-oxidative dehydrogenation or various redox mechanisms with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Chromium is typically dispersed on a support, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1, SBA-15, or MSUx are very good supports due to their large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到基于铬氧化物的材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为是CO2-PDH非常有前景的催化剂。在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的机制很复杂，涉及Cr(II)或/和Cr(III)物种参与非氧化脱氢或各种氧化还原机制，其中二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂参与氧化脱氢途径。高分散性和还原性铬物种的存在是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的重要因素。铬通常分散在支撑体上，而MCM-41、SBA-1、SBA-15或MSUx等介孔材料是很好的支撑体，因为它们的大比表面积允许高分散性和高浓度的铬氧化物种。

The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include high dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
