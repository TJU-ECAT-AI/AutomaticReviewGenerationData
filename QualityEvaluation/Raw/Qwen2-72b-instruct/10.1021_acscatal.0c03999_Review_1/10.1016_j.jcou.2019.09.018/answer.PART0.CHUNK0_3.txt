1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex, and the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed. The literature does state that high dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到基于铬氧化物的材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为是CO2-PDH非常有前景的催化剂。在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的机制很复杂，没有明确讨论在Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。文献确实指出，高分散性和还原性铬物种的存在是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的重要因素。
