1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include high dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is noted that the number of redox Cr sites correlates well with propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到基于铬氧化物的材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为是CO2-PDH非常有前景的催化剂。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括高分散性和还原性铬物种的存在。虽然没有明确讨论负载和载体性质对支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响，但确实指出，Cr的还原位点数量与丙烯产量之间存在良好的相关性，直到Cr的含量达到2 wt %。Beta沸石的脱铝化和随后通过简单浸渍分散铬，为CO2-PDH提供了优秀的催化剂。
