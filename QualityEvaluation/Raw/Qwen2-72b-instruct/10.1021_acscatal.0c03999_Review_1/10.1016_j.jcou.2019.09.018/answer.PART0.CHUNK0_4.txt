1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials are considered very promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is complex, and the presence of redox chromium species is an important factor for achieving high catalytic performance. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not explicitly discussed, but it is implied that high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species can be obtained on supports with large specific surface areas, such as mesoporous materials.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到基于铬氧化物的材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为对CO2-PDH非常有前景。在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的机制很复杂，红氧化铬物种的存在是实现高催化性能的重要因素。虽然没有明确讨论在不同负载和支撑物性质下支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，但可以推断，在具有大比表面积的支撑物，如介孔材料上，可以获得高分散和浓度的铬氧化物种。
