1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states.

1.该文件没有比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。它专注于Ni添加对CrOx/SBA-15催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷中的影响。影响CrOx/SBA-15催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括反应过程中活性Cr3+位点的还原，这会导致催化剂失活。虽然文件中没有详细讨论负载和载体性质对支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演变的影响，但提到添加Ni有助于将还原的Cr2+状态再生为活性Cr3+状态。
