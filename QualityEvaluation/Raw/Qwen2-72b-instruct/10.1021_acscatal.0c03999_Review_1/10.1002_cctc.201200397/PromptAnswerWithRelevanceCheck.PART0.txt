1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。然而，它确实专注于CrOx/silica催化剂，强调其在氧化脱氢丙烷与CO2(ODHP)反应中的高活性和潜力。影响支撑Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的演变，特别是Cr3+状态的维持，这对反应的活性至关重要。添加Ni作为促进剂有助于从还原的Cr2+状态再生活性Cr3+状态，提高了催化剂在ODHP反应中对丙烯的稳定性和选择性。

1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/silica catalyst include the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing for the regeneration of reduced CrOx and maintaining the active Cr3+ state.

1.文档没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP活性和选择性方面的比较。它专注于Ni对硅胶支持的CrOx催化剂在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应中的影响。影响CrOx/硅胶催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括反应过程中活性位点(Cr3+)的还原，这会导致严重的失活。向CrOx/硅胶催化剂中添加Ni增强了CO2的氧化能力，允许还原的CrOx再生，并保持活性Cr3+状态。

However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It focuses on the effect of Ni addition on the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst include the reduction of active Cr3+ sites during the reaction, which leads to deactivation. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the addition of Ni helps to regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states.
