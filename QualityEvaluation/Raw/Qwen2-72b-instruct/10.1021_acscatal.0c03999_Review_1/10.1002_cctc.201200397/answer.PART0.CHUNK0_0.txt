1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the maintenance of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the reaction's activity. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps regenerate the active Cr3+ states from the reduced Cr2+ states, enhancing the catalyst's stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。然而，它确实专注于CrOx/silica催化剂，强调其在氧化脱氢丙烷与CO2(ODHP)反应中的高活性和潜力。影响支撑Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的演变，特别是Cr3+状态的维持，这对反应的活性至关重要。添加Ni作为促进剂有助于从还原的Cr2+状态再生活性Cr3+状态，提高了催化剂在ODHP反应中对丙烯的稳定性和选择性。
