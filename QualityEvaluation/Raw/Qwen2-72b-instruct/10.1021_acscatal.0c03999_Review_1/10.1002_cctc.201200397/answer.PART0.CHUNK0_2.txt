1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on the CrOx/silica catalyst, highlighting its high activity and potential promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 catalysts include the evolution of chromium species, particularly the transformation of active Cr3+ states to inactive Cr2+ states during the reaction, which leads to severe deactivation. The addition of Ni as a promoter helps maintain the Cr3+ state and regenerate the active sites, enhancing the catalytic stability and selectivity for propylene in the ODHP reaction.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。然而，它确实专注于CrOx/silica催化剂，强调其在氧化脱氢丙烷与CO2(ODHP)中的高活性和潜在前景。影响支撑Cr2O3催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的演变，特别是活性Cr3+状态在反应过程中转化为非活性Cr2+状态，导致严重失活。添加Ni作为促进剂有助于维持Cr3+状态并再生活性位点，从而增强ODHP反应中丙烯的催化稳定性和选择性。
