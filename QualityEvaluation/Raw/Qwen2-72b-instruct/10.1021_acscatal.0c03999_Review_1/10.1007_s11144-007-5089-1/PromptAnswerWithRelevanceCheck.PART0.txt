1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content. The literature also notes that CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over chromium containing catalysts. The effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of the support, enhancing the yield of propene when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials but exerting an inhibiting effect on Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported catalysts. The literature further discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with a Cr content below the monolayer capacity of silica, indicating that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen. The literature suggests that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr6+ ions, is not an effective way of propene formation. Instead, the bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, which is active in both the dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reactions, may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述负载和载体性质变化时支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。然而，文献确实提到，CO2对丙烯产量的促进作用随着Cr含量的增加而降低。文献还指出，CO2不仅作为稀释剂和加热介质，而且作为氧化剂，在含铬催化剂的烃类脱氢中发挥作用。CO2的影响受到载体性质的强烈影响，当铬氧化物支撑在硅质材料上时，CO2会增强丙烯的产量，而在Al2O3或ZrO2支撑的催化剂上则会抑制脱氢反应。文献进一步讨论了CO2在Cr含量低于SiO2单层容量的CrOx/SiO2催化剂上脱氢丙烷的作用，表明CO2是一种非常弱的氧化剂，CO2的再氧化效率远低于氧气。文献建议，直接通过CO2氧化丙烷的脱氢，其中Cr3+离子被二氧化碳再氧化为Cr6+离子，不是形成丙烯的有效途径。相反，CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能特性，即在脱氢和逆向水煤气变换反应中都具有活性，可能是CO2存在时丙烷转化率和丙烯产量更高的原因。

1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the key factors influencing their catalytic performance. It focuses specifically on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst and its behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content.

1.该文件没有比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有讨论影响其催化性能的关键因素。它特别关注CrOx/SiO2催化剂及其在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中的行为。虽然没有详细讨论负载和载体性质对支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种演化的具体影响，但文中提到CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用随Cr含量的增加而降低。
