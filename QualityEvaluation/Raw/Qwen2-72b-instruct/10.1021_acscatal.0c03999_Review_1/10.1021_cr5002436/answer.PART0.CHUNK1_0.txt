1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，不同催化剂和反应条件下的值范围从0.52到1.23 × 105 s-1。对烯烃的选择性通常很高，不同催化剂和进料组成的范围从87%到98%。铬物种的演变受支持物性质的影响，较高负载量会导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，活性较低。铬物种的还原性也取决于支持物，弱金属-支持物相互作用导致还原性增加。支持物上存在羟基对催化剂的分散很重要，而酸性位点由于裂解和焦炭形成而有害。
