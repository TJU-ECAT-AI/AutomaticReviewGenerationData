1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the literature provides specific activity values for several Cr-based catalysts (Quotes 1-10). The literature also discusses the effects of support properties on the performance of Cr-based catalysts, with alumina being a commonly used support (Quote 11). The performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide (Quote 12). The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds (Quote 13). The literature also discusses the effects of support properties on the performance of gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, with the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion (Quote 14). The structure of the support is also important, with a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibiting an increased resistance to catalyst coking (Quote 15). The literature does not provide a direct comparison of the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but it does provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，文献为几种Cr基催化剂提供了具体活性值(引文1-10)。文献还讨论了支持物性质对Cr基催化剂性能的影响，氧化铝是一种常用的支撑物(引文11)。通过添加MgO，无论是作为促进剂还是作为混合氧化物的组成部分，都可以提高支撑钒催化剂的性能(引文12)。钒物种的还原性取决于它们的分子结构，VOV和VO键比VO-support键更容易还原(引文13)。文献还讨论了支持物性质对镓氧化物基脱氢催化剂性能的影响，支持物上酸性和碱性位点的加入对于实现高转化率很重要(引文14)。支持物的结构也很重要，具有介孔的GaAl混合氧化物表现出对催化剂焦炭的增强抵抗力(引文15)。文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，但它确实提供了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数的信息。
