1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the values range from 0.52 to 1.23 × 105 s-1 for different catalysts and reaction conditions. The selectivity to olefins is generally high, ranging from 87% to 98% for different catalysts and feed compositions. The evolution of chromium species is influenced by the support properties, with higher loadings leading to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which are less active. The reducibility of the chromium species also depends on the support, with weak metal-support interaction resulting in increased reducibility. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support is important for the dispersion of the catalyst, while acid sites are detrimental due to cracking and coke formation.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，不同催化剂和反应条件下的值范围从0.52到1.23 × 105 s-1。对烯烃的选择性通常很高，不同催化剂和进料组成的范围从87%到98%。铬物种的演变受支持物性质的影响，较高负载量会导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，活性较低。铬物种的还原性也取决于支持物，弱金属-支持物相互作用导致还原性增加。支持物上存在羟基对催化剂的分散很重要，而酸性位点由于裂解和焦炭形成而有害。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the literature provides specific activity values for several Cr-based catalysts (Quotes 1-10). The literature also discusses the effects of support properties on the performance of Cr-based catalysts, with alumina being a commonly used support (Quote 11). The performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide (Quote 12). The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds (Quote 13). The literature also discusses the effects of support properties on the performance of gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, with the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion (Quote 14). The structure of the support is also important, with a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibiting an increased resistance to catalyst coking (Quote 15). The literature does not provide a direct comparison of the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but it does provide information on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

The literature also mentions that the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline V2O5 species on vanadium-based catalysts. For molybdenum oxide-based catalysts, optimal activity is achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. Gallium oxide-based catalysts exhibit high activity when supported on acid sites of medium strength, and the reducibility of gallium oxide can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals. Carbon-based catalysts, such as carbon nanofibers and mesoporous carbon, show activity in the dehydrogenation of propane and butane. Other formulations, including indium and iron-based catalysts, have also been studied for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it discusses the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。铬物种可以存在于不同的氧化态（Cr3+，Cr4+，Cr5+，Cr6+）和配位环境中，这可能影响催化性能。文献通常认为Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr2O3的负载量和支持物的选择可以影响Cr3+物种的分散性和稳定性，以及支持物的酸性和碱性，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，Cr2O3的较高负载量可能导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，这会降低Cr3+物种的分散性，增加Cr6+物种的形成，而Cr6+物种对脱氢反应的活性较低。支持物还会影响Cr物种的还原性，具有较弱金属-支持物相互作用（MSI）的支持物会导致更容易还原的Cr物种。文献还讨论了CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，它可以作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆向水-气体转换反应从催化剂表面去除氢，从而增加烯烃的产量。然而，CO2也可以与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争，特别是在碱性位点上，这可能对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。
