1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it discusses the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The specific activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts is defined as (mol olefin formed)/(mol Cr*t(s)), and the catalyst life is defined as the total time of a single cycle/experiment. The literature also mentions that the surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the formation of monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline V2O5 species on vanadium-based catalysts. For molybdenum oxide-based catalysts, optimal activity is achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. Gallium oxide-based catalysts exhibit high activity when supported on acid sites of medium strength, and the reducibility of gallium oxide can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals. Carbon-based catalysts, such as carbon nanofibers and mesoporous carbon, show activity in the dehydrogenation of propane and butane. Other formulations, including indium and iron-based catalysts, have also been studied for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。Cr基脱氢催化剂的具体活性定义为(mol olefin形成)/(mol Cr*t(s))，催化剂寿命定义为单个周期/实验的总时间。文献还提到，在基于钒的催化剂上，金属负载与表面积的比率决定了单体、聚合或V2O5晶体物种的形成。对于基于钼氧化物的催化剂，当在氧化铝支持物上达到单层覆盖时，可获得最佳活性。当在中等强度的酸位点上支持时，基于镓氧化物的催化剂表现出高活性，而镓氧化物的还原性可以通过邻近其他更容易还原的金属来促进。基于碳的催化剂，如碳纳米纤维和介孔碳，在丙烷和丁烷的脱氢中表现出活性。其他配方，包括基于铟和铁的催化剂，也已被研究用于脱氢反应。
