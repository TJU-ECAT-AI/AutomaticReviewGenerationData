1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it discusses the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Chromium species can exist in different oxidation states (Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, Cr6+) and coordination environments, which can affect the catalytic performance. The literature mentions that Cr3+ species are generally considered to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The loading of Cr2O3 and the choice of support can influence the dispersion and stability of Cr3+ species, as well as the acidity and basicity of the support, which can impact the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. For instance, higher loadings of Cr2O3 can lead to the formation of larger Cr2O3 crystallites, which can decrease the dispersion of Cr3+ species and increase the formation of Cr6+ species, which are less active for dehydrogenation. The support can also affect the reducibility of Cr species, with supports that have a weak metal-support interaction (MSI) leading to more easily reducible Cr species. The literature also discusses the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, which can act as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields by removing hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, CO2 can also compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, which can negatively affect the performance of the catalyst.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它讨论了负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。铬物种可以存在于不同的氧化态（Cr3+，Cr4+，Cr5+，Cr6+）和配位环境中，这可能影响催化性能。文献通常认为Cr3+物种是脱氢反应的活性位点。Cr2O3的负载量和支持物的选择可以影响Cr3+物种的分散性和稳定性，以及支持物的酸性和碱性，这可能影响催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，Cr2O3的较高负载量可能导致较大Cr2O3晶粒的形成，这会降低Cr3+物种的分散性，增加Cr6+物种的形成，而Cr6+物种对脱氢反应的活性较低。支持物还会影响Cr物种的还原性，具有较弱金属-支持物相互作用（MSI）的支持物会导致更容易还原的Cr物种。文献还讨论了CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，它可以作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆向水-气体转换反应从催化剂表面去除氢，从而增加烯烃的产量。然而，CO2也可以与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争，特别是在碱性位点上，这可能对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。
