1.A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have particularly high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species.

1.已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。目前，铬物种在CO2 ODP反应中的价态仍存在争议，特别是在DHP与CO2反应的真实条件下，对于ZrO2基催化剂的Cr物种，较少有operando表征。几个研究小组报告说，从初始聚集体Cr6+还原得到的配位不饱和Cr3+比初始孤立Cr6+的还原形式更活跃。原位光谱技术的发展使得在反应条件下探测这些催化剂成为可能。Michorczyk等人通过原位UVvis DRS研究了Cr/SBA-1催化剂，发现纯CO2能够将Cr2+氧化为Cr3+和Cr6+物种，表面羧酸盐可能在宽温度范围内CO2活化中起重要作用。在550 C下，Cr6+物种在DHP与CO2反应开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。Cr3+和Cr2+物种可能参与丙烯形成的替代氧化途径。Shishido等人提出，C3H8的氧化脱氢来自Cr6+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原。
