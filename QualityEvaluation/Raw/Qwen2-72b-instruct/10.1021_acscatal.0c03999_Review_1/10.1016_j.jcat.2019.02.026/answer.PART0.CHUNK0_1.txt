1.A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Chromium oxides have been found to have particularly high activity. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Utilizing in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy and discrete Fourier transform calculations, the structure of chromium species, the redox reaction path, and the formation of coke under real reaction conditions were investigated. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced during the induction period than the monomeric Cr6+ species. The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Although CO2 can indeed oxidize Cr3+ to Cr6+, it takes a much longer time and a relatively higher concentration of CO2 than the reduction of Cr6+ species under real reaction conditions. The oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane. The different catalytic performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by the above calculation. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of 7CrAZrO2 catalysts and the catalytic performance for the DHP reaction with CO2 is established on the atomic and molecular level.

1.已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应。铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。原位光谱技术的发展使得在反应条件下探测这些催化剂成为可能。利用原位/操作Raman光谱和离散傅立叶变换计算，研究了真实反应条件下铬物种的结构、氧化还原反应路径和焦炭的形成。在诱导期，聚集体Cr6+物种比单体Cr6+物种更容易还原。配位不饱和的聚集体和孤立Cr3+位点是丙烷与CO2脱氢的主要催化活性位点。虽然CO2确实可以将Cr3+氧化为Cr6+，但这需要更长的时间和相对较高的CO2浓度，比实际反应条件下Cr6+物种的还原要长。CO2的氧化能力低于丙烷的还原能力。上述计算也可以解释配位不饱和孤立Cr3+物种和聚集体Cr3+物种的不同催化性能。在原子和分子水平上，建立了7CrAZrO2催化剂的物理化学性质与CO2-DHP反应催化性能之间的基本关系。
