Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. Several studies have shown that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has enabled the investigation of these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. found that pure CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species on the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst, and surface carboxylates may play a role in CO2 activation across a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 involves the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. However, the valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts.

1.A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the dehydrogenation of propane reaction with CO2 (CO2-ODHP). Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The catalytic performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the initial valence state of the chromium species, the support properties, and the loading of chromium. Chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts can evolve from polymeric Cr6+ to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ upon reduction, with the latter being more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has enabled the study of these catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the presence of polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species on the ZrO2 surface. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio increases with increasing chromium loading. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.
