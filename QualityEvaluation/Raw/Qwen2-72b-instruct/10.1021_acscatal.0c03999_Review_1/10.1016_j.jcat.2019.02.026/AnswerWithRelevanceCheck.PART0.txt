          [1] "A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reac- tion with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]."
          [2] "Fur- thermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsat- urated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]."
          [3] "The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions."
          [4] "Michorczyk et al. [27] investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS. Pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures."
          [5] "The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C [15,28]."
          [6] "The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation."
          [7] "Shishido et al. [21] pro- posed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species."
          [8] "At present, the valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts."
          [9] "The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface, only two surface Cr6+ species were observed without Cr2O3 crystal clus- ters: a polymeric species (possessing a Cr@O stretching frequency at 1009 cm1 and a CrAOACr bending mode at 885 cm1) and a monomeric species (characterized by a Cr@O stretching frequency at 1033 cm1) [4041]."

          [12] "The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced during the induction period than the monomeric Cr6+ species, which is consis- tent with the reduction process under 0.1% H2/Ar gas flow (Fig. S5A)."
          [13] "So the coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalyt- ically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of the Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period."
          [14] "The above calculation can also explain the different catalytic performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species."
          [15] "So a fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of 7CrAZrO2 catalysts and the catalytic performance for the DHP reaction with CO2 is established on the atomic and molecular level."

          A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts. Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS and found that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface revealed only two surface Cr6+ species without Cr2O3 crystal clusters: a polymeric species and a monomeric species. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

          已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。目前，铬物种在CO2 ODP反应中的价态仍存在争议，特别是在DHP与CO2反应的真实条件下，对于ZrO2基催化剂的Cr物种，较少有operando表征。几个研究小组报告说，从初始聚集体Cr6+还原得到的配位不饱和Cr3+比初始孤立Cr6+的还原形式更活跃。原位光谱技术的发展使得在反应条件下探测这些催化剂成为可能。Michorczyk等人通过原位UVvis DRS研究了Cr/SBA-1催化剂，发现纯CO2能够将Cr2+氧化为Cr3+和Cr6+物种，表面羧酸盐可能在宽温度范围内CO2活化中起重要作用。在550 C下，Cr6+物种在DHP与CO2反应开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。Cr3+和Cr2+物种可能参与丙烯形成的替代氧化途径。Shishido等人提出，C3H8的氧化脱氢来自Cr6+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原。ZrO2表面上铬物种的拉曼光谱显示，只有两种表面Cr6+物种，没有Cr2O3晶体簇：一种聚集体物种和一种单体物种。xCrAZrO2催化剂的Cr6+/Cr3+比率随着Cr/(Zr + Cr)原子比的增加而增加。7CrAZrO2催化剂上观察到最高的丙烯产量的周转频率（TOF）。在诱导期，聚集体Cr6+物种比单体Cr6+物种更容易还原。诱导期后，只有配位不饱和的聚集体和孤立Cr3+位点存在，它们是CO2-ODHP的主要催化活性位点。孤立Cr3+物种和聚集体Cr3+物种的不同催化性能可以通过它们的不同性质来解释。在原子和分子水平上，7CrAZrO2催化剂的物理化学性质与其CO2-ODHP催化性能之间的基本关系已经建立。
