1.A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the CO2-ODHP reaction. Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. Several studies have shown that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has enabled the investigation of these catalysts under reaction conditions. Michorczyk et al. found that pure CO2 can oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species on the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst, and surface carboxylates may play a role in CO2 activation across a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C. Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. proposed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 involves the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. However, the valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for ZrO2-based catalysts.

1.已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应。其中，铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。几项研究表明，从初始聚集体Cr6+还原得到的配位不饱和Cr3+比初始孤立Cr6+的还原形式更活跃。原位光谱技术的发展使得在反应条件下研究这些催化剂成为可能。Michorczyk等人发现，纯CO2可以在Cr/SBA-1催化剂上将Cr2+氧化为Cr3+和Cr6+物种，表面羧酸盐可能在宽温度范围内CO2活化中发挥作用。在550 C下，Cr6+物种在CO2-ODHP反应开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。Cr3+和Cr2+物种可能参与丙烯形成的替代氧化途径。Shishido等人提出，C3H8的氧化脱氢涉及Cr6+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原。然而，CO2-ODHP反应中铬物种的价态仍然存在争议，特别是在ZrO2基催化剂的真实条件下，Cr物种的原位表征较少。
