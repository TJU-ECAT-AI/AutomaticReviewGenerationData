1.A variety of metal oxide catalysts, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported for the dehydrogenation of propane reaction with CO2 (CO2-ODHP). Among them, chromium oxides have been found to have especially high activity. The catalytic performance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the initial valence state of the chromium species, the support properties, and the loading of chromium. Chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts can evolve from polymeric Cr6+ to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ upon reduction, with the latter being more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has enabled the study of these catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the presence of polymeric and monomeric Cr6+ species on the ZrO2 surface. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio increases with increasing chromium loading. The highest turnover frequency (TOF) for propylene production is observed on the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced than the monomeric Cr6+ species during the induction period. After the induction period, only coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites remain, which are the main catalytically active sites for CO2-ODHP. The different catalytic performance of isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species can be explained by their different properties. A fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst and its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP has been established at the atomic and molecular level.

1.已经报道了各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP。其中，铬氧化物被发现具有特别高的活性。这些催化剂的催化性能受铬物种的初始价态、载体性质和铬负载量等因素的影响。在支撑的Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种可以从聚集体Cr6+还原为配位不饱和的Cr3+，后者比初始孤立Cr6+的还原形式更活跃。原位光谱技术的发展使我们能够在反应条件下研究这些催化剂，揭示了ZrO2表面上存在聚集体和单体Cr6+物种。Cr6+/Cr3+的比率随着铬负载量的增加而增加。7CrAZrO2催化剂上观察到最高的丙烯产量的周转频率（TOF）。在诱导期，聚集体Cr6+物种比单体Cr6+物种更容易还原。诱导期后，只有配位不饱和的聚集体和孤立Cr3+位点存在，它们是CO2-ODHP的主要催化活性位点。孤立Cr3+物种和聚集体Cr3+物种的不同催化性能可以通过它们的不同性质来解释。在原子和分子水平上，7CrAZrO2催化剂的物理化学性质与其CO2-ODHP催化性能之间的基本关系已经建立。
