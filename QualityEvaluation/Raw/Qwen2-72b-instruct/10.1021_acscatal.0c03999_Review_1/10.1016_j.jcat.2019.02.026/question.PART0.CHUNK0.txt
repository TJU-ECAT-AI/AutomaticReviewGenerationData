CO2
a b s t r a c t Highly dispersed chromium oxide-modified mesoporous ZrO2 (xCrAZrO2) was prepared via an acidbase pair pathway and evaporation-induced self-assembly method for the dehydrogenation of propane reac- tion with CO2. The resulting materials exhibit mesoporous structure and different zirconia crystals with doped chromium species. Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abun- dant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained. The following conclu- sions were drawn by utilizing the in situ/operando Raman spectroscopy and discrete Fourier transform calculations to investigate the structure of chromium species, the redox reaction path, and the formation of coke under real reaction conditions. The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction. The fore- most effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed. 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
The selective oxidation of light alkanes is of fundamental and industrial significance because they provide a potential route for effectively transforming alkanes into value-added and useful chemicals for effective utilization of abundant natural gas and shale gas resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene has attracted considerable attention [15].
The activation of inert CAH bonds of propane requires energy- intensive conditions, which easily lead to combustion pathways of more reactive olefins to COx during the ODHP [58]. Recently,carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins,has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2 [9,10]. Meanwhile, the effective utilization of greenhouse gases (CO2) has a positive effect on the global ecosystem and climate because it offers the potential to create new commercially viable products from renewable carbon feedstock in a sustainable manner.
A number of transition metal oxide catalysts for the DHP reac- tion with CO2, including indium-, gallium-, vanadium-, and chromium-based catalysts, have been reported. Chromium oxides have been verified to have especially high activity [1115]. Fur- thermore, several groups have reported that coordinatively unsat- urated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+ [16,17]. Wu et al. claimed that the enhanced activity of the hydrothermally pre- pared Cr2O3AZrO2 is attributable to a higher concentration of Cr6+ species. On the other hand, the nature of CO2 interaction with dis- persed chromium species on different supports (SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2,zeolites, etc.) is obviously different. But for the mixed Cr2O3AZrO2 oxide catalysts, CO2 has positive effect on the DHP reaction [17 21]. This can be attributed to the higher density of surface basicity due to the terminal hydroxyl groups (the strong Lewis acidity of Zr4+ and the Lewis basicity of O2 pairs) on the ZrO2 structure,which results in CO2 adsorption. CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is ben- eficial for enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion.
CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by elim- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026 0021-9517/ 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is now generally considered that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ sites act as active sites in the dehydrogenation of propane without oxygen [7], while Tatiana et al. proposed that surface coordina- tively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) of bulk binary CrZrOx catalysts are also active sites for nonoxidative PDH [2426]. But no research has demonstrated that Zrcus are also responsible for DHP with CO2.
The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions.
Michorczyk et al. [27] investigated the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst through in situ UVvis DRS. Pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, and the surface carboxylates may play an important role in the CO2 activation in a wide range of temperatures. The Cr6+ species were already reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the DHP with CO2 at 550 C [15,28]. The Cr3+ and Cr2+ species may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propylene formation. Shishido et al. [21] pro- posed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 was from the redox of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. At present, the valence of chromium species in the ODP reaction with CO2 is still controversial, and there are fewer operando characterizations of Cr species under the real conditions of DHP with the CO2 reaction, especially for the ZrO2-based catalysts.
Here, we demonstrate a novel direct and facile method for preparing a highly dispersed chromium oxide-species- incorporated mesoporous tetragonal ZrO2. The general synthesis strategy is based on an acidbase pair pathway combined with evaporation-induced self-assembly [29,30]. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships between Cr con- tent, structural changes, and catalytic performance for DHP with
CO2. The reaction path and the source of byproducts were
researched. As in situ Raman spectroscopy can study the molecular structures of active sites and the surface coking dynamically responds to reaction environments [5,3134], we used in situ/- operando Raman spectroscopy to investigate other important issues: the real state, redox properties, and structural changes of the active sites under different reaction conditions. The foremost effect of CO2 for inhibiting deactivation under real reaction condi- tions was preventing reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating coke. A new coke formation route was also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis method
A simple way in which the self-adjusted inorganicinorganic (II) interplay between two inorganic precursors is guided by acidbase chemistry considerations [29,30]. Here triblock copoly- mers (Pluronic P123, Mav = 5800, EO20PO70EO20, Aldrich) were used as templates to prepare highly ordered mesoporous minerals with much smaller pore sizes and thinner pore walls. Then quanti- tative Cr(CH3COO)3 (99%, Beijing Chem. Corp., China) and ZrOCl2- 8H2O (99%, Beijing Chem. Corp., China) were added into alcohol solution with P123 (total amount of Cr and Zr is 10 mmol). All the chemicals were commercially available and used without fur- ther purification. After being stirred at least 2 h at 50 C, the homo- geneous sol was transferred to an oven at the desired temperature and humidity for solvent evaporation. After 24 h aging, the gel pro- duct was dried at 80 C for 24 h. Calcination was carried out by slowly increasing temperature from room temperature to 550 C and heating at 550 C in air for 6 h. The samples were labeled as xCrAZrO2 (xCr), where  denotes the Cr content (Cr:(Cr + Zr) = x:100, molar ratio).
2.2. Catalyst general characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical Empyrean power diffraction system using CuKa radiation (40 kV,30 mA) in the 2h interval 590 for wide angle analysis with a step size of 0.02. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 196 C were recorded using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 porosimeter. The specific surface area was calculated by the BET (BrunauerEmme ttTeller) method; the pore-size distribution was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the BJH (BarettJoy nerHalenda) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope.
To explore the element distribution mapping on the samples, an analytical high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning trans- mission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X- ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrome- ter using MgKa (hv = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.603  1019 J) X-ray source. The fresh catalyst undergoes OPH with CO2 (550 C) for 5 h or exposure to H2 (H2/N2 = 1:9, total flow 5 ml/min) at 550 C for 1 h, denoted as spent and reduced catalyst, respectively.
Temperature-programmed reduction with
H2
(H2
TPR)
and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3 TPD) were car- ried out on a Quantachrome apparatus. H2 and the NH3 desorption signal was monitored by TCD.
2.3. In situ Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectra were obtained using a high-resolution Raman spectrometry system (Renishaw inVia Reflex, excitation wavelength at 532 nm). The sample was mounted in an in situ cell with a quartz window (Xiamen Tops Instrument Co.), which allows treatments at a desired temperature and gas flow. The samples were taken at 550 C for 1 h in 10% O2/Ar. The sample was then cooled to room temperature in O2/Ar for Raman measurement. This process is called pretreatment.
In situ Raman spectra under reduction and oxidation atmo- spheres at 550 C were obtained in sequence as follows. The sam- ples were kept at 550 C under pure Ar after pretreatment.
Subsequently, the gas was switched to 0.1% H2/Ar for the required time as the A step. In the B step, the CO2 gas flow was opened and the 2% H2/4%CO2/Ar gas was kept flowing. Then CO2 gas was closed and the gas flow was switched to 5% H2/Ar for required time as the C step. Finally, in the D step, H2 gas flow was closed and the gas flow was switched to 2% O2/Ar. At every stage (the total flow was 50 ml min1), the spectra were recorded at relevant time intervals.
For further investigation of coke formation of trace CO2 under H2, 5% H2/Ar was continued after pretreatment and small amounts of CO2 were pulsed at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 550 C. We recorded the spectrum at each temperature after 1 h.
For operando Raman spectra under real reaction conditions as a function of time on stream, the samples were purged with O2 and Ar at 550 C for 30 min sequentially. The 2% CO2/1% C3H8/Ar mix- ture gases were introduced into the cell and then held at a constant flow rate during spectral acquisition. To research the elimination of coke under CO2, 5% CO2/Ar and 10% CO2/Ar flows were introduced into the cell with the spent catalysts.
2.4. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic performance of the catalysts was tested in a fixed- bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and at 550 C. The par- ticle size of the catalysts was 6080 mesh. Then 200 mg of the cat- alyst was placed in the reactor tube (internal diameter 6 mm) and pretreated with O2/N2 gas at 550 C for 30 min, followed by purg- ing with pure N2 at the same temperature. The composition of the

207 reactant gas mixture was C3H8/CO2/N2 = 1:2:37, and the total flow was 20 ml min1. The reactants and products were analyzed by on- line gas chromatographs equipped with two flame ionization detectors (FID). A Porapak Q column (3 m) was used for the sepa- ration of acrolein, propanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, C3H6, C3H8, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4. Separation of other components, such as HCHO, CO, and CO2, was carried out in a TDX-01 column, and then in a nickel-based high-temperature furnace (turning the oxide into CH4) before the detector.
3. Results
3.1. Highly dispersed chromium oxide-modified ZrO2 materials with
mesoporous structure The wide-angle XRD patterns of xCrAZrO2 are represented in Fig. 1. Both monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO2) phases were identified in the samples with Cr loading below 5%. However,the increasing chromium content resulted in an increase in the fraction of t-ZrO2, and the only XRD visible phase in 7Cr-ZrO2 was t-ZrO2. Heteroatom oxide dopants in ZrO2 are well known to distinctly improve the stabilization effect of crystallization in sev- eral previous studies [3536]. This is related to the formation of oxygen vacancies for charge compensation or the distortion of the ZrO2 lattice. More Cr species incorporated into ZrO2 lattice may lead to destroying the tetragonal crystalline form and forming disordered ZrO2, which was confirmed by the weakening of the characteristic peak of the t-ZrO2 phase. No diffraction peaks related to separate CrOx-based phase(s) were found in any incorpo- rated samples, which indirectly confirms the incorporation of chro- mium ions into the zirconia lattice, the low quantity of chromium oxide, and/or its high dispersion on the support.
Furthermore, we utilized Raman spectroscopy in combination with the XRD patterns to determine the surface structure and mor- phology of xCrAZrO2 samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the m-ZrO2 pre- sents very well defined peaks compared with t-ZrO2, and the intense peaks for m-ZrO2 are located at 178, 189, and 476 cm1 (characteristic peak of the monoclinic phase), while weak peaks of xCrAZrO2 (x > 3) are located at 146, 262, 313, 459, and 630 cm1, plus one shoulder at ca. 560 cm1, which can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of tetragonal-phase ZrO2. With increasing chromium content, more chromium was incorporated into the ZrO2 phase to form CrZrOx solid solutions, resulting in phase transformation from m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2 [3739]. For the Raman spectra of chromium species on the ZrO2 surface, only two surface Cr6+ species were observed without Cr2O3 crystal clus- ters: a polymeric species (possessing a Cr@O stretching frequency at 1009 cm1 and a CrAOACr bending mode at 885 cm1) and a monomeric species (characterized by a Cr@O stretching frequency at 1033 cm1) [4041]. The peak intensities of these two kinds of Cr6+ species increase with increasing chromium content, but the peak intensities become weaken and move to low Raman shift when the Cr content exceeds 7%, probably indicating the formation of more polymeric Cr6+ species on the disordered ZrO2.
The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms and pore size distribu- tion of the xCrAZrO2 samples are shown in Fig. 3. The isotherms of the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are more similar to a type IV isotherm and exhibit a type H2 hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop shifted to low pressure of the relative pressure range as more doping chro- mium was introduced into the ZrO2. The pore size distribution of xCrAZrO2 samples becomes more concentrated and the average pore size decreases with increasing chromium content. The incor- poration of chromium into zirconia distinctly improves the surface area, pore volume, and pore-size distribution, as summarized in Table 1. Well-developed mesoporous structures with tetragonal crystalline walls and pore necking in the 3D faulted structure are expected to provide enhanced catalytic performance due to high surface area and proper ZrO2 crystallization [30].
The TEM images in Fig. 4 confirm that the xCrAZrO2 (x > 3) sam- ples contains three-dimensional wormhole-like channels. The pore size, as determined from TEM images, is in good agreement with the average pore size from the BJH result. To examine the disper- sion of chromium oxide, TEM images and EDS elemental line and mapping analyses of the 7CrAZrO2 were used (Fig. S1 in the Sup- plementary Material). From these 2D atomic mapping images, we can confirm that the chromium oxide is highly dispersed through- out mesoporous t-ZrO2 structure without the formation of a large bulk state of chromium oxide. This is also consistent with the XRD and Raman results for 7CrAZrO2. As the HR-TEM image (Fig. S2) shows, the dominant exposed planes of the t-ZrO2 support are 111 and 220 facets, which further confirms the single tetrago- nal crystal form [42].
The XPS spectra of xCrAZrO2 are shown in Fig. 5. The Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratios of xCrAZrO2 nanocomposite catalysts were deter- mined by XPS in the near-surface region. It was from 0.05 to 0.21 for xCrAZrO2 and enormously different from the corresponding nominal values of 0.01 to 0.1 (Table 1). The concentration of Cr on the surface of xCrAZrO2 is all higher than that in the bulk phase.
The XPS results indicate the enrichment of Cr on the surface, and some parts of Cr are incorporated into the ZrO2 structure to form 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 ZrO2 + t-ZrO2 * m-ZrO2 + + + * * * * * * * 10Cr-ZrO2 7Cr-ZrO2 5Cr-ZrO2 3Cr-ZrO2 Intensity (a.u.) 2   () 1Cr-ZrO2 * + θ Fig. 1.

a solid solution, which transfers the crystalline phase of ZrO2. Two peaks occurred for Cr2p3/2 spectra on all catalysts, one at 577 eV and the other at 579 eV, which can be assigned to Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively [43]. The binding energy (BE) values of Cr2p3/2 peaks were obtained by applying a peak-fitting program and the peak area ratio of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is given in Table 1. The BE values for Cr3+ and Cr6+ on all catalysts were very similar. The Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of the xCrAZrO2 catalysts increased with the increasing Cr/(Zr + Cr) atomic ratio.
3.2. Redox and acidic/basic properties
Fig. 6 shows the H2 TPR profiles of xCr ZrO2 samples. The tem- perature (TmaxH2) of maximal consumption of hydrogen for each catalyst is listed in Table 1. Bare zirconia [44] demonstrated only a small hydrogen uptake above 620 C. This can be ascribed to hydrogen reaction with lattice oxygen of zirconia. The strong sig- nals of hydrogen consumption are around 330 C and the intensity of the peak increases with chromium content, which should be related to the reduction of Cr6+. There are weak peaks of hydrogen consumption between 400 and 450 C. The position of the peak shifts to lower temperatures with chromium content. Hence, the second peak can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface lattice oxygen of zirconia [26]. Removal of lattice oxygen from zir- conia forms Zrcus.
NH3 TPD experiments were carried out to investigated the acid properties of the series of xCrAZrO2, catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 7. For all the samples, a broad desorption peak of NH3 was observed in a temperature range between 120 and 500 C. The weak, medium, and strong acidic sites characterized by NH3 desorption maxima at 202231, 235304, and 317 403 C, respectively, could be identified for all ZrO2-based materi- als according to several previous studies [45]. Bare ZrO2 had large fractions of strong and medium acidic sites characterized by ammonia desorption above 230 C. With increasing of chromium doping amount, the main peak shifted to lower temperatures. This is because the surface polymerized chromium species covers the strong acid sites of zirconia, generating weak acid sites by itself.
As shown in Fig. S11, the amount of CO2 adsorption increased with the doping of Cr species and with increasing Cr content.
Moreover, the desorption temperature of the CO2 peak shifted to higher temperature. So surface basic sites increased with Cr species doping. From calculated apparent TOF results, TOF(CO2) and TOF (C3O8) both increased with the Cr content (x < 10, xCrAZrO2). The basic site facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2, thereby promoting propane dehydrogenation.
3.3. Catalytic performance
The results of time on stream for propane conversion, CO2 con- version, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield are given in Fig. 8. The propane and CO2 conversion both increased as the chro- mium content (x) of xCrAZrO2 was raised from 1 to 7, but decreased when  increased further from 7 to 10 at the same stream time. All the xCrAZrO2 (x > 1) catalysts gave an initial con- version above 65%. For the 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst, the deactivation rate was lowest and the highest propane conversion was maintained for the entire reaction time.

209 The regenerative cycles of the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are repre- sented in Fig. S3. The propylene yield on the catalyst decreased from 40% to 27% after 300 min on stream in the first cycle. The regeneration step was carried out with an O2 stream at 550 C for 0.5 h to reoxidize the reduced active chromium species and combust deposited carbon. After the second and third regenera- tion, the propylene yield returned to 40%, indicating that the orig- inal activity of the catalyst was fully recovered.
Fig. 8C and Fig. S4A and B show propylene, methane, and CO selectivity versus reaction time for the series of xCrAZrO2 catalysts.
In the same initial reaction time, the selectivity for propylene increased first and then decreased as the chromium species increased, while the methane selectivity was just the opposite. It is interesting that CH4 was the main cracking product over all the xCrAZrO2 catalysts in the DHP reaction with CO2, while the total selectivity for C2H6 and C2H4 was below 2%. The selectivity for CO was almost the same for all xCrAZrO2 catalysts, around 20% at the initial reaction time, and basically did not change with the reaction time.
3.4. In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements
In situ techniques for the characterization of catalysts can pro- vide information on the structure of surface species by probing the vibrational properties of different bonds under in situ conditions.
Therefore, direct correlations can be established between the structures of active sites and active performance under different conditions.33 Fig. S5A gives the Raman spectra of the 7CrAZrO2 sample col- lected at 550 C under 0.1% H2/Ar gas flows. The extent of reduction of the surface chromium species is reflected in the Raman intensity of the Cr@O bonds [46]. The bands at 871 and 1007 cm1 disap- pear more quickly than the bands at 1031 cm1. This indicates that the polymeric Cr6+ species are reduced more easily and rapidly than the monomeric Cr6+ species. This result is consistent with the results reported by Baek et al. that polymeric Cr6+ species, which are more easily reducible to oligomeric Cr3+ species than isolated Cr6+ species, exhibits a higher turnover frequency than isolated Cr3+ sites [16,32,33].3 To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flow- ing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [4648]), and they become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C. These results demonstrate that the trace amount of adsorbed CO2 reacted with abundant adsorbed atomic hydrogen species to become coke species. But the large amount of CO2 reacted with hydrogen spe- cies, and no coke species formed.

The reoxidation of the reduced chromium oxide species and the elimination of coke can easily be realized in the presence of low concentrations of oxygen. As Fig. S5D shows, the intensities of the bands at about 1395 and 1595 cm1 decrease first; then the bands at 871, 1007, and 1031 cm1 appear, and their intensities increase after 7 min at 550 C under 2% O2/Ar gas flows. This indi- cates that the presence of oxygen first eliminates the coke and then regenerates reduced chromium oxide species back to the initial oxidized state, probably because the coke species cover the reduced chromium oxide species. Moreover, the intensity of the bands at 1030 cm1 increases more quickly than that of the bands at 871 and 1007 cm1. Especially at 10 min, the peak area of isolated Cr6+ species is larger than that of polymeric Cr6+ species.
This indicates that some monomeric Cr6+ species are oxidized more easily and rapidly than the polymeric Cr6+ species.
4. Discussion
4.1. The relationship of the structural changes and the catalytic
performance of DHP to CO2 According to the above XPS, BET, Raman, and other characteri- zation results, on one hand, the surface area of xCrAZrO2 and the proportion of tetragonal crystals gradually increase along with the doping Cr content, both of which are favorable for exposing and dispersing reactive sites. On the other hand, more oligomeric Cr6+ species are dispersed on the surface of t-ZrO2, and there are also some isolated chromium species doped into the zirconia lat- tice (change of zirconia crystalline phase) and supported on the surface of t-ZrO2. Jayeon et al. [16] reported that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of the initial isolated Cr6+ species, in accordance with the activity performance of xCrAZrO2. The further increasing of the doping amount of chro- mium species leads to excessive polymerization of chromium spe- cies (fewer active pseudo-Cr2O3 species) on the surface of zirconia,according to Raman characterization analysis. It is also certified by the calculated apparent TOFs for the yield of propylene as function of Cr surface density (Fig. 9). The highest TOF (C3H6) is obtained on 7CrAZrO2.
With chromium species increasing, the strong acid sites of zir- conia carriers were covered, while the numbers of weak acid sites of surface oligochromium species and isolated chromium species are increased, which is beneficial to inhibiting coke and converting propane. For the 1CrAZrO2 catalyst with less chromium doping,the selectivity of propylene increases first and then decreases with the reaction time. This is due to the fact that the chromium species first deactivates for coke and for abundant exposed zirconia with low DHP activity. Moreover, its intrinsic propene selectivity is lower [26]. For all the xCrAZrO2 (x > 1) catalysts, propylene selec- tivity increases with reaction time, because the overactive chro- mium species are gradually covered by coke with time on stream. This is illustrated by the results of the increasing coke selectivity of all xCrAZrO2 catalysts with reaction time in Fig. S4C.
4.2. The main structure of active sites under real reaction condition
and the redox reaction path According to a previous report, this promoting effect can be rationalized by CO2 play some role in three aspects [6]: (1) the con- sumption of H2 produced by the dehydrogenation of propane via a reverse water-gas shift reaction, (2) the direct participation of CO2 in the ODP reaction, and (3) the elimination of coke to stabilize the catalysts. The reactions are as follows:

4 To investigate the role of CO2 in the DHP reaction, the catalytic tests on fresh 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst using C3H8/N2 and C3H8/CO2/N2 feeds were compared. The results, shown in Fig. 10, clearly demon- strate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the conversion of propane, but slightly reduced the selectivity of propylene after 1 h reaction. The catalyst was deactivated more slowly in the pres- ence of CO2, which proves that CO2 plays a promoting role in the ODP reaction over the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst. There are few reports about the structure of chromium species under the real reaction conditions of DHP with CO2 reaction. So we used operando Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations to identify the possible Cr species under real reaction conditions and designed experi- ments to investigate the redox reaction path on the active sites. 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Propylene yield (%) Time on stream (min) 1Cr-ZrO2 3Cr-ZrO2 5Cr-ZrO2 7Cr-ZrO2 10Cr-ZrO2 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 Propylene selectivity (%) Time on stream (min) 1Cr-ZrO2 3Cr-ZrO2 5Cr-ZrO2 7Cr-ZrO2 10Cr-ZrO2 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1Cr-ZrO2 3Cr-ZrO2 5Cr-ZrO2 7Cr-ZrO2 10Cr-ZrO2 Propane conversion (%) Time on stream (min)

4.2.1. Operando Raman spectroscopic studies of Cr species
To investigate the change of the catalyst surface under real reaction conditions with time on stream, the operando Raman spectra were recorded. Fig. 11 shows the in-site Raman spectra of a 7CrAZrO2 sample collected at 550 C under 1% C3H8/2% CO2/ Ar gas flow, which is very similar to the real reaction conditions.
The oligomeric Cr6+ species are more easily reduced during the induction period than the monomeric Cr6+ species, which is consis- tent with the reduction process under 0.1% H2/Ar gas flow (Fig. S5A). Fig. S7 shows the XPS characterization results, con- trasted with the Cr2p(3/2) peak of Cr3+. The binding energy shift from Cr3+ to Cr2+ was 1.0 eV, the peak of the reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst at 575.5 eV can be assigned to the Cr2p(3/2) of Cr2+. So most of the Cr6+ species of the fresh 7Cr-ZrO2 catalyst was reduced to the Cr3+ species during DHP with CO2, but it was not further reduced to the Cr2+ species [49,50]. Michorczyk et al. [27] have shown through in situ UVvis DRS that pure CO2 was able to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ in a wide range of temperatures. So the coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalyt- ically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of the Cr6+ species were detected after the induction period.
Although CO2 can indeed oxidize Cr3+ to Cr6+, it takes a much longer time and a relatively higher concentration of CO2 than the reduction of Cr6+ species under real reaction conditions (Figs. 11 and 12). For the redox of chromium species, the oxidizing ability of CO2 is lower than the reduction ability of propane. Interestingly,some isolated Cr3+ sites are more easily oxidized to Cr6+ sites than oligomeric Cr3+ sites under CO2/Ar, which is consistent with the oxidation process under O2/Ar.
4.2.2. DFT calculations of Cr species
A surface model is built according to the experimental observa- tions and DFT calculations. The most probable structures of Cr spe- cies under real reaction conditions and redox process were researched [51]. Fig. S8 shows side view and top view structures of ZrO2. ZrO2 unit cells can cut out three crystal facets; we used the dominant exposed crystal facet with the lowest surface energy of ZrO2(1 1 1). It can be seen that the surface of ZrO2 (1 1 1) exposes by pentacoordinated Zr atoms, dicoordinated oxygen atoms, and tricoordinated oxygen atoms. Fig. 13 shows ZrO2 doped with a chromium atom (ZrO2ACr, representative of isolated Cr3+ species), ZrO2 loaded with a layer of Cr2O3 (ZrO2ACr2O3, represen- tative of oligomeric Cr3+ species), ZrO2 with an oxygen vacancy, ZrO2ACr with an oxygen vacancy, and ZrO2ACr2O3 with an oxygen vacancy. We found that the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ZrO2 is 5.09 eV, but the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ZrO2- ACr is 1.54 eV, while the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ZrO2ACr2O3 is only 0.42 eV. This shows that doping with chro- mium atoms facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies on ZrO2, because electrons are more easily transferred from chro- mium atoms to oxygen atoms. It is consistent with this the removal of lattice oxygen from zirconia (forming Zrcus) could take place at lower temperatures with chromium doping (Fig. 7).
The above calculation can also explain the different catalytic performance of coordinatively unsaturated isolated Cr3+ species and oligomeric Cr3+ species.
So a fundamental relationship between the physicochemical properties of 7CrAZrO2 catalysts and the catalytic performance for the DHP reaction with CO2 is established on the atomic and molecular level.
To compare the oxygen-getting ability of chromium atoms in ZrO2ACr and ZrO2ACr2O3, the process of oxygen adsorption on the oxygen vacancies (Fig. S9) was calculated. The initial bond length of oxygen is 1.24 Å, and it is 1.34 Å after adsorption, indicat- ing that O2 is reduced to O2 2 by Cr. To analyze the bonding nature of the different states, a crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis was conducted. The bond length of Zr and O is
1.86 Å in ZrO2ACr and 1.93 Å in ZrO2ACr2O3. As the ZrAO bond
strength in ZrO2ACr is greater than that of ZrO2ACr2O3, Zr4+ cus of ZrO2ACr chemically absorbs O2 2 and then oxidizes Cr3+ more easily.
This is consistent with the Raman results for O2 and CO2 oxidation of 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 Time (min) 230min 120min 80min 60min 45min 48min Intensity (a.u.)

213 reduced Cr species. From investigation of the Zrcus in Fig. S7, the Zr3d spectrum of spent/reduced 7CrAZrO2 can be well resolved, as in the fresh counterpart. This may further illustrate that Zr4+ cus can easily be oxidized in the ambient environment.
According to theoretical calculations [24,52], the excess elec- tron density is mainly localized in the anion vacancy. Thus, for the CO2 oxidation process, ZrO2ACr and ZrO2ACr2O3 with oxygen vacancies are likely to adsorb CO2 chemically, and then dissociate CO2 to CO and activated oxygen. Here, the oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are donated as active oxidative chromium species.
4.2.3. Redox reaction at active oxidative chromium sites under real
reaction conditions Propane was excessively oxidized to CO (Fig. S4B), which demonstrates that CO2 not only enhanced the equilibrium conver- sion of propane by removing hydrogen through the RWGS reaction,but also dissociated on the catalyst surface to generate active oxy- gen, which participates in the redox reaction. For the apparent TOF of 7CrAZrO2 in Fig. 9, the apparent TOF (CO2) value is almost the same as TOF (C3H8), meaning that the rate of CO2 consuming H species is comparable to the formation rate of H species from
DHP. So CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chro-
mium species by excessive hydrogen species.
In contrast with the reduced 7CrAZrO2 sample, the extra 30% higher propane conversion of the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst can be attributed to the contribution of active oxidative chromium species (Fig. 10). The corresponding lower propylene selectivity of the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst can also prove that more propylene reacts further on more active oxidative chromium species than on reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst.
It is generally accepted that the acid sites on the surface of the catalyst are the main factors responsible for propane cracking.
Compared with 10CrAZrO2, 7CrAZrO2 possesses a lower total den- sity of acidic sites, but higher selectivity for CH4, which is charac- terized by NH3 TPD (Fig. 7) and Fig. S4A. So methane is not from simple propane cracking. To further investigate the source of CH4 and CO, we designed a catalytic performance evaluation experi- ment in which propane was replaced by propylene under the same reaction conditions. The results are shown in Fig.S6A. CO2 and C3H6 conversion by fresh 7CrAZrO2 is higher than that by reduced 7CrAZrO2 at initial time on-stream. This is due to propylenes easily reacting with active oxygen on active oxidative chromium species. For the reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst, propylene is relatively inert on reduced chromium species; meanwhile, the oxidation of the reduced chromium species by CO2 to the active oxidative state was slow under the reaction conditions, resulting in consumption of less carbon dioxide. The conversion of propane and carbon diox- ide on both the fresh and reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalysts at the later time on stream is very low, mainly due to the coverage of the active sites with coke.
To explore the sources and reaction paths of its byproducts, we analyzed the products distribution of propylene reacted with car- bon dioxide on the fresh and reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6B, the methane and CO selectivity of the reduced 7CrAZrO2 catalyst ARE about 4% and 96%, respectively, but the selectivity FOR methane is as high as 20% on the fresh 7CrAZrO2 catalyst at the initial reaction time. It is confirmed that by- products of methane and CO in the DHP reaction with CO2 are from the reaction of propylene and CO2 on the active oxidative chro- mium sites, as in the equation
C3H6 + 3CO2 $ CH4 + 5CO + H2O.

4.3. The effect of CO2 on the formation and elimination of coke
As we know, alkanes and corresponding alkenes are carbon sources for coke species. We also found that CO2 is a source of coke as well (Fig. S5C). Especially for anaerobic DHP, CO2 is produced in the initial induction period and adsorbed on the surface of the cat- alyst, where it reacts with abundant H species to produce coke spe- cies.
To further investigate the generation temperature of deposited carbonaceous species on the surface of the catalyst, the in situ Raman spectra of 7CrAZrO2 in flowing 5% H2/Ar as a func- tion of different temperatures with CO2 impulse were recorded and the results are shown in Fig. 14. The surface Cr6+ species began to be reduced at 200 C under 5% H2/Ar gas flow and was reduced completely at 300 C. Meanwhile, the peak of coke species appeared at 300 C and their intensity increased remarkably above
500 C.
There are two conditions for the formation of coke from COx.
The first is the reduced Cr species with abundant H species to fix carbon dioxide. The second is the carbon chain growth and arom- atization reaction when temperature exceeds 300 C. But a large amount CO2 in the feed atmosphere can inhabit the formation of coke (Fig. S5B). A large amount of CO2 consumed dissociated Fig. 13. ZrO2 doped with a chromium atom (ZrO2ACr), ZrO2 loaded with a layer of CrO3 (ZrO2ACr2O3), ZrO2 with an oxygen vacancy, ZrO2ACr with an oxygen vacancy, and ZrO2ACr2O3 with an oxygen vacancy. Color scheme: light blue, Zr; red, O; purple, Cr; yellow, oxygen vacancy.

atomic hydrogen species on the surface, so that there are not enough hydrogen species to further deoxygenate the carbonoxy- gen species to form hydrocarbon species for coupling chain growth and aromatization.
The Raman peaks assigned to the coke species appear after the induced reduction period, which is partially responsible for the catalyst deactivation (Fig. 11). Cr6+ species are the main active sites for the propane combustion reaction, whereas the Cr2+ species is active for light alkene polymerization [5356]. So CO2 can main- tain Cr3+ species during DHP to inhabit coke formation on the Cr2+ species (Fig. S7).
The elimination rate of coke under 5% CO2 was very low, which is similar to the real reaction conditions. The intensity of coke spe- cies peaks is almost unchanged after 80 min (Fig. S10). When the flow of CO2 is increased twice, the peaks of coke species disappear slowly and completely disappear after 180 min (Fig. 12). So the existence of CO2 is beneficial for eliminating coke and inhibiting the formation of coke. The latter effect may play a more important role in maintaining high reaction performance for DHP with CO2.
Based on the above discussion, the main reaction networks and the active sites of DHP with CO2 over 7CrAZrO2 sample are pro- posed (Fig. 15). The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric/isolated Cr3+ sites with oxygen vacancies and active oxidative chromium sites are the main catalytically active sites under real reaction con- ditions. The H species from DHP consumed the active oxygen on active oxidative Cr3+ species and created oxygen vacancies; then O species from CO2 dissociation filled the oxygen vacancies to com- plete the redox process. The Cr2+ or Cr6+ species will exist when the 7CrAZrO2 sample is under pure reductive (H2/C3H8) or pure oxida- tive conditions (O2/CO2) at 550 C, respectively.
5. Conclusions
We have demonstrate a novel direct and reproducible method (evaporation-induced self-assembly combined with an acidbase pair pathway) for preparing a highly dispersed chromium oxide species incorporated into mesoporous ZrO2. The resulting materi- als exhibit a mesoporous structure resembling 3D wormholes with doping of chromium species, and the crystalline zirconia support changes from a monoclinic to a tetragonal and disordered crystal.
Catalytic performance for DHP with CO2 is affected by surface area,crystalline structure of ZrO2, dispersity and initial valence of Cr species, and surface acidity and redox property of the catalysts with different Cr doping content (from 1 to 10 mol.%). Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with a large amount of dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species on t-ZrO2 showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied: initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5%. Com- bining catalytic results with in situ Raman spectroscopy results under real reaction conditions with time on stream, we investi- gated the structure of chromium species by DFT calculations, redox reaction path, and the formation of coke and reached the following conclusions: (1) The coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehy- drogenation of propane with CO2, as no Raman peaks of Cr6+ spe- cies were observed after the induction period. (2) The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen from CO2 dissocia- tion under the real reaction condition are donated as active oxida- tive chromium species. (3) CO2 prevents the reduction of Cr3+ species to Cr2+ species. Methane and CO byproducts are mainly generated from the reaction of propylene and CO2 on the active oxidative chromium sites. (4) The foremost effect of the presence of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke, since the rate of CO2 elimination of coke is pretty low. We propose a new coke for- mation route, which is trace CO2 reacting with large H species on the Cr2+ species.
