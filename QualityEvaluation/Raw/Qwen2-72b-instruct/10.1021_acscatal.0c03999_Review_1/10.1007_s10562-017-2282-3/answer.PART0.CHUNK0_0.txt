1.The catalytic performance of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies with the loading of chromium, with the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst showing the highest propane conversion (45%) and propylene selectivity (75%). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the dispersion and inter-convertibility of chromium species, with Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ being crucial for high activity. The TUD-1 support enables high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles, which contributes to the better catalytic performance.
