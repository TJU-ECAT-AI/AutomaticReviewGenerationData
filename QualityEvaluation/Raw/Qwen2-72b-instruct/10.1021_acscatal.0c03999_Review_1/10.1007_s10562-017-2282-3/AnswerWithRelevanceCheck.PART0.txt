          [1] "A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant."
          [2] "Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%)."
          [3] "As revealed by the characterization techniques, the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials."
          [4] "The TUD-1 enables to encapsulate the chromium nanoparticles in the porous silica structure with high dispersion which help in maintaining the better catalytic performance."

          The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst, prepared by microwave irradiation, shows a high propane conversion of 45% and a good propylene product selectivity of 75%. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance.
