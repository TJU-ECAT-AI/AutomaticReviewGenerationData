[1] "A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant."
[2] "Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%)."
[3] "As revealed by the characterization techniques, the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials."
[4] "The TUD-1 enables to encapsulate the chromium nanoparticles in the porous silica structure with high dispersion which help in maintaining the better catalytic performance."

1.The catalytic performance of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies with the loading of chromium, with the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst showing the highest propane conversion (45%) and propylene selectivity (75%). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the dispersion and inter-convertibility of chromium species, with Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ being crucial for high activity. The TUD-1 support enables high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles, which contributes to the better catalytic performance.
