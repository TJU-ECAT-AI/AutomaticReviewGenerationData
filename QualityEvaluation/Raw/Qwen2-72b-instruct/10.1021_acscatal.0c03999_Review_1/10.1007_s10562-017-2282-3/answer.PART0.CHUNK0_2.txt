1.The catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP vary among different metal oxide catalysts. In the study, a series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with different chromium loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared and tested. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst showed the highest propane conversion (45%) and good propylene selectivity (75%). The key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species and the high dispersion of chromium nanoparticles encapsulated in the porous silica structure of TUD-1.
