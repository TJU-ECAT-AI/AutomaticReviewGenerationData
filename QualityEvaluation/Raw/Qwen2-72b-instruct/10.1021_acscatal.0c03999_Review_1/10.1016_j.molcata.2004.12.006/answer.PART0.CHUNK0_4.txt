[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
[2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
[4] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
[5] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
[6] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

1.Among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra are observed. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be explained by the parallel occurrence of direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1.在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，实现了65%的苯乙烯转化率和超过90%的选择性。苯乙烯的形成速率随着Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到1.7 wt.%。在反应过程中，Cr(VI)O4以四面体配位形成活性单铬酸盐物种，并还原为活性较低的Cr(III)O6八面体配位的多铬酸盐物种。失活的催化剂可以通过气体氧气或CO2的处理进行再生，在此过程中，聚合Cr(III)O6八面体的再分配和再氧化为单体Cr(VI)O4四面体被观察到。CO的生成速率随着CO2分压的增加而增加，而H2的生成速率则下降。在Cr-MCM-41上确认发生了逆水煤气变换反应。在Cr-MCM-41上，CO2脱氢乙苯过程中CO的生成速率可以通过假设两种反应的平行发生来很好地解释，即CO2直接氧化脱氢乙苯和由逆水煤气变换反应热力学辅助的简单脱氢乙苯。
