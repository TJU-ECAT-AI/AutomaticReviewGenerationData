[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
[2] "The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
[4] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "It was confirmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a separate experiment."
[7] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

1.Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among the tested M-MCM-41 catalysts, achieving a styrene conversion of 65% and a selectivity of over 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution and reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra is observed. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. The rate of CO formation increased with increasing partial pressure of CO2, while the rate of H2 formation decreased. Reverse water-gas shift reaction was confirmed to take place over Cr-MCM-41. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 can be accounted for by assuming the parallel occurrence of two reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1. Cr-MCM-41在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中表现出最高的活性，实现了65%的苯乙烯转化率和超过90%的选择性。苯乙烯形成速率随Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到1.7 wt.%。Cr(VI)O4以四面体配位形成活性单铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中还原为Cr(III)O6八面体配位的活性较低的多铬酸盐物种。失活的催化剂可以通过气体氧气或CO2的处理进行再生，在此过程中观察到聚合Cr(III)O6八面体的再分配和再氧化为单体Cr(VI)O4四面体。主要存在于Cr-MCM-41上的单铬酸盐物种在脱氢反应过程中还原为聚集的Cr(III)，具有八面体配位。CO2的分压增加时，CO的生成速率增加，而H2的生成速率下降。确认了Cr-MCM-41上发生了逆水煤气变换反应。在Cr-MCM-41上，乙苯与CO2的脱氢过程中CO的生成速率可以通过假设两个反应的并行发生来解释：直接氧化脱氢乙苯与CO2和简单的脱氢乙苯热力学上由逆水煤气变换反应辅助。
