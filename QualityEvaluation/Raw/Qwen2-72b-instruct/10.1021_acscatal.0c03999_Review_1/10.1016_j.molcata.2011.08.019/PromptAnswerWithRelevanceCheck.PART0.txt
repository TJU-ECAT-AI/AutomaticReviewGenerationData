1.Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective for CO2-ODHP. The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point IEP). Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites. When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, which makes it useless as a catalyst.

1.在研究的材料中，含有Cr或Ga的材料被发现是CO2-ODHP中最活跃和最具选择性的。硅胶支撑的铬氧化物材料（Cr/硅胶）的催化活性取决于几个因素，包括氧化态、Cr物种的结构和铬-硅胶的相互作用。这些因素受到Cr前体的类型、制备条件（例如，煅烧温度）、Cr含量和硅胶载体的性质（例如，等电点IEP）的影响。在氧化的Cr/硅胶催化剂的表面，Cr物种在3+、5+和6+氧化态共存。在硅胶的单层覆盖下，Cr物种在较高的氧化态下占主导地位，主要是以单-和多-铬酸盐的形式的Cr6+物种。这些高度分散且对反应物完全可及的物种被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。当Cr含量超过单层覆盖时，形成无定形和结晶的-Cr2O3。结晶的-Cr2O3的形成，即最热力学稳定的铬氧化物相，被高温和过量的水加速。-Cr2O3在硅胶表面的存在对催化活性有负面影响，因为并非所有的Cr原子都能接触到反应物分子。此外，结晶的-Cr2O3对氢和氧高度抵抗，这使得它作为催化剂无用。
