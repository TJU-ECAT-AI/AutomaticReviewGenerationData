1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation. It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one. CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways. CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the redox cycle, and CO2 can play a role in the removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane by the reverse watergas shift reaction. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. The promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry. Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, the character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system. While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances.

1.最近研究了在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢作为平衡控制脱氢的替代途径。在这种新过程中，与商业过程相比，可以以更高的产率获得丙烯。二氧化碳通过两条独立的途径提高了丙烯的产率。二氧化碳可以作为氧化剂参与以下氧化还原循环：C3H8 MeOx C3H6 MeOx1 H2O (1) CO2 MeOx1 CO MeOx (2) 另一方面，二氧化碳可以通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除在丙烷脱氢过程中产生的氢气。氢气分压的降低使脱氢平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。二氧化碳的促进作用被提出以解释在镓氧化物基催化剂上观察到的高丙烯产率。丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢具有生态影响，因为它代表了化学二氧化碳利用的方法。在这个过程中，二氧化碳被还原为一氧化碳，作为化工行业的反应物更有价值。在所有研究的氧化物催化剂中，基于铬氧化物的支撑材料被认为是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。然而，支撑材料的性质强烈影响铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢性能。在商业上用于轻烷脱氢过程的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂中，催化活性受到二氧化碳的抑制。在CrOx/ZrO2系统中也观察到了二氧化碳的不利影响。然而，在CrOx/SiO2或CrOx/(氧化金刚石)上，二氧化碳对催化剂性能产生了促进作用。为了提高铬氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下丙烷脱氢的活性，应尽可能地实现铬氧化物物种的分散。因此，最近更多地关注高表面积材料作为分散铬物种的支撑材料。不同的硅质介孔筛，如：MCM-41，SBA-15或MSU-x，由于其高表面积(6001100 m2 g1)，均匀的孔径和相对较高的热稳定性，已被广泛研究。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品中获得了最佳结果。在这种情况下，丙烯的选择性超过80%，而丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。在所有研究的催化剂中都发现了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用。这种作用基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度编程反应以及用纯二氧化碳再生还原催化剂后的H2-TPR实验进行讨论。建议在二氧化碳存在下观察到的丙烯产率高于在二氧化碳不存在下测量的丙烯产率的原因之一是丙烷脱氢与逆向水煤气变换反应的耦合。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢时丙烯的高产率。铬氧化物基材料在脱氢和RWGS反应中均具有高催化活性，这与分散的铬物种的存在有关。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种(氧化态较低的Cr2+/Cr3+)的前体。
