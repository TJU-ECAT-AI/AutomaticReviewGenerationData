          [1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation."
          [2] "It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
          [3] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
          [4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
          [5] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
          [6] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
          [7] "The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from 1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr."
          [8] "The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD (Fig. 1.) and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements (Fig. 2.)."
          [9] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
          [10] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."
          [11] "CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle: C3H8  MeOx  C3H6  MeOx1  H2O (1) CO2  MeOx1  CO  MeOx (2)"
          [12] "On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the reverse watergas shift reaction (4)."
          [13] "C3H8  C3H6  H2 (3) CO2  H2  CO  H2O (4)"
          [14] "The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy- drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation."
          [15] "Such promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts."
          [16] "The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization."
          [17] "In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry."
          [18] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
          [19] "However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts."
          [20] "Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2."
          [21] "The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system."
          [22] "While over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances."
          [23] "For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
          [24] "Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [68], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (6001100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability."
          [25] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr."
          [26] "In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
          [27] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
          [28] "This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2."
          [29] "It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [30] "The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2."
          [31] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
          [32] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
          [33] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
          [34] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation.

          在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究作为对平衡控制脱氢的替代途径，与商业过程相比，观察到更高的丙烯产量。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品上取得了最佳结果，丙烯的选择性超过80%，丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。对于所有研究的催化剂，都发现了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用。基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度程序反应和H2-TPR实验讨论了二氧化碳的作用。为了在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下提高铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性，应尽可能地实现铬氧化物物种的分散。H2消耗量随Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到6.8 wt% Cr，然后对于Cr含量最高的催化剂，H2消耗量下降。在Cr6.8/MCM-41和Cr13.7/MCM-41样品中，通过XRD检测到a-Cr2O3的形成，并通过UVvis-DRS测量确认。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）的前体。二氧化碳通过两条独立的途径提高了丙烯的产率：涉及二氧化碳作为氧化剂的氧化还原循环和逆水煤气变换反应，该反应去除氢气并使脱氢反应平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。氢气分压的降低使脱氢平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。二氧化碳的促进作用被提出以解释在镓氧化物基催化剂上观察到的高丙烯产率。丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢具有生态影响，因为它代表了化学二氧化碳利用的方法。在这个过程中，二氧化碳被还原为一氧化碳，作为化工行业的反应物更有价值。在所有研究的氧化物催化剂中，基于铬氧化物的支撑材料被认为是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。然而，支撑材料的性质强烈影响铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢性能。在商业上用于轻烷脱氢过程的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂中，催化活性受到二氧化碳的抑制。在CrOx/ZrO2系统中也观察到了二氧化碳的不利影响。然而，在CrOx/SiO2或CrOx/(氧化金刚石)上，二氧化碳对催化剂性能产生了促进作用。因此，最近更多地关注高表面积材料作为分散铬物种的支撑材料。不同的硅质介孔筛，如：MCM-41，SBA-15或MSU-x，由于其高表面积(6001100 m2 g1)，均匀的孔径和相对较高的热稳定性，已被广泛研究。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢时丙烯的高产率。铬氧化物基材料在脱氢和RWGS反应中均具有高催化活性，这与分散的铬物种的存在有关。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种(氧化态较低的Cr2+/Cr3+)的前体。氧化还原机制已被提出用于铬、锰、钒和铁氧化物基催化剂。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在RWGS反应中的高催化活性是观察到的更高丙烯产量的额外原因。
