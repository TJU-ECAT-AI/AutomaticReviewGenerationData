[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation. It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
[4] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
[5] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
[6] "The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from 1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr."
[7] "The formation of a-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD (Fig. 1.) and confirmed by UVvis-DRS measurements (Fig. 2.)."
[8] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."

1.在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢最近被研究为一种替代的平衡控制脱氢途径。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品中取得了最好的结果，丙烯的选择性超过80%，丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。对于所有研究的催化剂，二氧化碳对丙烯产量的促进作用被发现。基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度程序反应和H2-TPR实验讨论了二氧化碳的作用。为了在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下提高铬氧化物基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性，应尽可能地实现铬氧化物物种的分散。H2消耗量随Cr负载量的增加而增加，直到6.8 wt% Cr，然后对于Cr含量最高的催化剂，H2消耗量下降。在Cr6.8/MCM-41和Cr13.7/MCM-41样品中，通过XRD检测到a-Cr2O3的形成，并通过UVvis-DRS测量确认。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）的前体。
