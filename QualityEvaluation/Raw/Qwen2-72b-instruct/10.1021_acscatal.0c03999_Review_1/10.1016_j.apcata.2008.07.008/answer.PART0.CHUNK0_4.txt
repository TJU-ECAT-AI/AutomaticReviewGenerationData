[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."
[4] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
[5] "On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the reverse watergas shift reaction (4)."
[6] "The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy- drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation."
[7] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[8] "However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts."
[9] "Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2 [1,2,6]."
[10] "The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system [5], while over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances."
[11] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
[12] "For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
[13] "Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [68], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (6001100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability."
[14] "In the present paper, we have reported the catalytic activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by the conventional impregnation method in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2."
[15] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
[16] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
[17] "This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2."
[18] "It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[19] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. CO2 improves propene yield through two pathways: a redox mechanism involving chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts, and by facilitating the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. Chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on various materials are highly active, but the support's nature significantly affects their dehydrogenation properties. CO2 has inhibitory effects on CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, but a promoting effect on CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). High dispersion of chromium oxide species enhances activity in the presence and absence of CO2. High surface area materials like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x are used as supports for chromium species. MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts show good activity in propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2. The role of CO2 is explored through temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. CO2 promotes propene yield in all studied catalysts, likely due to coupling with the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The high activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the reverse water-gas shift reaction contributes to the higher propene yield.

1.在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究作为对平衡控制脱氢的替代途径，显示出更高的丙烯产量。二氧化碳通过两种途径提高丙烯产量：涉及铬、锰、钒和铁氧化物基催化剂的氧化还原机制，以及通过促进逆水煤气变换反应，该反应去除氢气并使脱氢反应平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。基于各种材料支持的铬氧化物催化剂具有高度活性，但支持物的性质对它们的脱氢性质有重大影响。二氧化碳对CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2催化剂有抑制作用，但对CrOx/SiO2和CrOx/(氧化金刚石)有促进作用。铬氧化物物种的高分散度在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下增强了活性。高表面积材料如MCM-41、SBA-15和MSU-x被用作铬物种的支持物。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中，无论二氧化碳是否存在，都表现出良好的活性。二氧化碳的作用通过温度编程反应和TPR实验进行探讨。二氧化碳在所有研究的催化剂中都促进了丙烯产量，这可能是由于与逆水煤气变换反应的耦合。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在逆水煤气变换反应中的高活性是观察到的更高丙烯产量的额外原因。
