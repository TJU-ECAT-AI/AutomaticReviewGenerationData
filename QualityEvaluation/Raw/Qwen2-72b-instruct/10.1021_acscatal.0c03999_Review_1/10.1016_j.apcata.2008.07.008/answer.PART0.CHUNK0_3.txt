[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation. It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[2] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
[4] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."
[5] "The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique."
[6] "The UVvis-DR spectra of the calcined MCM-41- supported chromium oxide catalysts. Two main absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm and one shoulder band at about 440 nm appear for all the samples. These peaks were assigned to Cr6+O2 charge transfer transition of chromate species."
[7] "The spectra of the catalysts with the Cr content above 3.4 wt% show additionally two bands at 470 and 600 nm due to the A2g ! T1g and A2g ! T2g transitions of Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry, respectively."
[8] "The temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the cal- cined catalysts and crystalline Cr2O3 (pre-treated in air) are presented."
[9] "The reduction effects measured for the studied catalysts depend on the Cr loading."
[10] "The presence of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species differently interacting with the silica support."
[11] "An increase in the Cr content above 3.4 wt% of Cr results in an appearance of additional low-temperature reduction maximum at about 553 K."
[12] "The location of this maximum coincided well with the low temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined a-Cr2O3, which is assigned to reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ or Cr2+ species dispersed on a-Cr2O3."
[13] "Therefore, the presence of low temperature maximum confirms an existence of a-Cr2O3 in the catalysts with Cr loading above 3.4 wt%."
[14] "The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from 1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr."
[15] "This strong decrease of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr loading is due to the formation of crystalline a-Cr2O3."
[16] "The dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2."

1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, and it has been shown that in this new process, propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The dispersion of Cr is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2. The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique. The UVvis-DR spectra of the calcined MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts show two main absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm and one shoulder band at about 440 nm, which are assigned to Cr6+O2 charge transfer transition of chromate species. The spectra of the catalysts with the Cr content above 3.4 wt% show additionally two bands at 470 and 600 nm due to the A2g ! T1g and A2g !

The temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the calcined catalysts and crystalline Cr2O3 (pre-treated in air) are presented, and the reduction effects measured for the studied catalysts depend on the Cr loading. The presence of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species differently interacting with the silica support. An increase in the Cr content above 3.4 wt% of Cr results in an appearance of additional low-temperature reduction maximum at about 553 K.

1.在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究为一种替代的平衡控制脱氢途径，研究表明在这种新过程中，与商业过程相比，可以以更高的产率获得丙烯。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品上取得了最佳结果，丙烯的选择性超过80%，丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。对于所有研究的催化剂，都发现了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用。Cr的分散是丙烷脱氢在存在和不存在二氧化碳时催化活性的重要因素。在XRD图谱中，较低Cr负载样品中不存在a-Cr2O3相的衍射线，这可能是由于这种相在MCM-41支撑上的高分散或XRD技术的检测限。MCM-41支撑的铬氧化物催化剂的UVvis-DR光谱显示两个主要吸收带在270和365 nm，一个肩带在约440 nm，这些峰被归因于Cr6+O2电荷转移过渡的铬酸盐物种。Cr含量超过3.4 wt%的催化剂的光谱另外显示在470和600 nm的两个带，这是由于Cr3+在八面体对称性中的A2g ! T1g和A2g ! T2g跃迁。展示了煅烧催化剂和预处理在空气中的结晶Cr2O3的温度程序还原曲线，研究催化剂的还原效应取决于Cr负载。两个峰的存在可归因于与二氧化硅支撑相互作用的Cr6+物种的还原。Cr含量超过3.4 wt%时，出现额外的低温还原最大值，约553 K。这个最大值的位置与煅烧a-Cr2O3观察到的低温还原最大值很好地吻合，这被归因于Cr6+到Cr3+或Cr2+物种在a-Cr2O3上分散的还原。因此，低温最大值的存在证实了Cr负载超过3.4 wt%的催化剂中存在a-Cr2O3。H2消耗随着Cr负载的增加直到6.8 wt% Cr，然后对于具有最高Cr含量的催化剂减少，而H2/Crtot的比率从0.7 wt% Cr增加到13.7 wt% Cr时，从1.46急剧下降到0.37。这种随着Cr负载增加而H2/Crtot比率的强烈下降是由于结晶a-Cr2O3的形成。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢中丙烯的高产率。
