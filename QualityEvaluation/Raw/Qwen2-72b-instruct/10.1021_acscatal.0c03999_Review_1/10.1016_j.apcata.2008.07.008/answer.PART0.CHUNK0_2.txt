[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."
[4] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
[5] "The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy- drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation."
[6] "Such promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts [1417]."
[7] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[8] "However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts."
[9] "Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2 [1,2,6]."
[10] "The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system [5], while over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances."
[11] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
[12] "For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
[13] "Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [68], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (6001100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability."
[14] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
[15] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
[16] "The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr."
[17] "In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
[18] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[19] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."

1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, with higher yields of propene observed compared to commercial processes. CO2 improves propene yield through two pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which reduces hydrogen partial pressure, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation. Chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts have been proposed for the redox mechanism, while gallium oxide-based catalysts show high propene yields attributed to CO2's promoting role. Among oxide catalysts, supported chromium oxide materials are considered the most promising due to their high activity, but the support's nature significantly influences dehydrogenation properties. CO2 has inhibitory effects on CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, while promoting activity on CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). To enhance activity, chromium oxide species should be highly dispersed, leading to increased attention on high surface area supports like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x. The role of CO2 is explored through temperature-programmed reactions with H2 and H2-TPR experiments. All studied catalysts exhibit a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, with the best results achieved at 6.8 wt% Cr loading, showing over 80% selectivity to propene and increased propane conversion from 21% to 62% across the studied temperature range. The high catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based materials in dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is attributed to the presence of dispersed chromium species, with Cr6+ species on MCM-41 serving as precursors for catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states.

1.在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究作为对平衡控制脱氢的替代途径，与商业过程相比，观察到更高的丙烯产量。二氧化碳通过两种途径提高丙烯产量：涉及二氧化碳作为氧化剂的氧化还原循环和逆水煤气变换反应，该反应降低了氢气的分压，使平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。已为氧化还原机制提出了基于铬、锰、钒和铁的氧化物催化剂，而基于镓氧化物的催化剂显示出高丙烯产量，归因于二氧化碳的促进作用。在氧化物催化剂中，基于支持的铬氧化物材料被认为是由于其高活性而最有前景的，但支持物的性质对脱氢性质有重大影响。二氧化碳对CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2催化剂有抑制作用，而对CrOx/SiO2和CrOx/(氧化金刚石)有促进作用。为了增强活性，铬氧化物物种应该尽可能地分散，这导致对高表面积支持物如MCM-41、SBA-15和MSU-x的更多关注。二氧化碳的作用是通过与H2的温度编程反应和H2-TPR实验来探讨的。所有研究的催化剂都显示出二氧化碳对丙烯产量的促进作用，最佳结果是在6.8 wt%的Cr负载下实现的，显示出对丙烯超过80%的选择性，丙烷的转化率从21%增加到62%，跨越研究的温度范围。基于铬的氧化物材料在脱氢和RWGS反应中的高催化活性归因于分散的铬物种的存在，MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性的Cr物种在较低氧化态的前体。
