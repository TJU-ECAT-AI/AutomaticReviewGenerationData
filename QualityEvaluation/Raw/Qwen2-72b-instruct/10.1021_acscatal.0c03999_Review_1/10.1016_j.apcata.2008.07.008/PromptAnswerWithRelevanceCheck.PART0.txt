1.最近研究了在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢作为平衡控制脱氢的替代途径。在这种新过程中，与商业过程相比，可以以更高的产率获得丙烯。二氧化碳通过两条独立的途径提高了丙烯的产率。二氧化碳可以作为氧化剂参与以下氧化还原循环：C3H8 MeOx C3H6 MeOx1 H2O (1) CO2 MeOx1 CO MeOx (2) 另一方面，二氧化碳可以通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除在丙烷脱氢过程中产生的氢气。氢气分压的降低使脱氢平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。二氧化碳的促进作用被提出以解释在镓氧化物基催化剂上观察到的高丙烯产率。丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢具有生态影响，因为它代表了化学二氧化碳利用的方法。在这个过程中，二氧化碳被还原为一氧化碳，作为化工行业的反应物更有价值。在所有研究的氧化物催化剂中，基于铬氧化物的支撑材料被认为是最有前景的，因为它们具有高催化活性。然而，支撑材料的性质强烈影响铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢性能。在商业上用于轻烷脱氢过程的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂中，催化活性受到二氧化碳的抑制。在CrOx/ZrO2系统中也观察到了二氧化碳的不利影响。然而，在CrOx/SiO2或CrOx/(氧化金刚石)上，二氧化碳对催化剂性能产生了促进作用。为了提高铬氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下丙烷脱氢的活性，应尽可能地实现铬氧化物物种的分散。因此，最近更多地关注高表面积材料作为分散铬物种的支撑材料。不同的硅质介孔筛，如：MCM-41，SBA-15或MSU-x，由于其高表面积(6001100 m2 g1)，均匀的孔径和相对较高的热稳定性，已被广泛研究。在含有6.8 wt% Cr的样品中获得了最佳结果。在这种情况下，丙烯的选择性超过80%，而丙烷的转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。在所有研究的催化剂中都发现了二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用。这种作用基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度编程反应以及用纯二氧化碳再生还原催化剂后的H2-TPR实验进行讨论。建议在二氧化碳存在下观察到的丙烯产率高于在二氧化碳不存在下测量的丙烯产率的原因之一是丙烷脱氢与逆向水煤气变换反应的耦合。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢时丙烯的高产率。铬氧化物基材料在脱氢和RWGS反应中均具有高催化活性，这与分散的铬物种的存在有关。分散在MCM-41表面的Cr6+物种是催化活性Cr物种(氧化态较低的Cr2+/Cr3+)的前体。

1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, with higher yields of propene observed compared to commercial processes. CO2 improves propene yield through two pathways: a redox cycle involving CO2 as an oxidizing agent and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which reduces hydrogen partial pressure, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation. Chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts have been proposed for the redox mechanism, while gallium oxide-based catalysts show high propene yields attributed to CO2's promoting role. Among oxide catalysts, supported chromium oxide materials are considered the most promising due to their high activity, but the support's nature significantly influences dehydrogenation properties. CO2 has inhibitory effects on CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, while promoting activity on CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). To enhance activity, chromium oxide species should be highly dispersed, leading to increased attention on high surface area supports like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x. The role of CO2 is explored through temperature-programmed reactions with H2 and H2-TPR experiments. All studied catalysts exhibit a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, with the best results achieved at 6.8 wt% Cr loading, showing over 80% selectivity to propene and increased propane conversion from 21% to 62% across the studied temperature range. The high catalytic activity of chromium oxide-based materials in dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is attributed to the presence of dispersed chromium species, with Cr6+ species on MCM-41 serving as precursors for catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states.

The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr, with the selectivity to propene above 80% and the conversion of propane increasing from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. The dispersion of Cr is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2. The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique. The UVvis-DR spectra of the calcined MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts show two main absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm and one shoulder band at about 440 nm, which are assigned to Cr6+O2 charge transfer transition of chromate species. The spectra of the catalysts with the Cr content above 3.4 wt% show additionally two bands at 470 and 600 nm due to the A2g ! T1g and A2g ! T2g transitions of Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry, respectively. The temperature-programmed reduction profiles of the calcined catalysts and crystalline Cr2O3 (pre-treated in air) are presented, and the reduction effects measured for the studied catalysts depend on the Cr loading. The presence of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species differently interacting with the silica support.

This strong decrease of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr loading is due to the formation of crystalline a-Cr2O3.

T1g和A2g ! T2g跃迁。展示了煅烧催化剂和预处理在空气中的结晶Cr2O3的温度程序还原曲线，研究催化剂的还原效应取决于Cr负载。两个峰的存在可归因于与二氧化硅支撑相互作用的Cr6+物种的还原。Cr含量超过3.4 wt%时，出现额外的低温还原最大值，约553 K。这个最大值的位置与煅烧a-Cr2O3观察到的低温还原最大值很好地吻合，这被归因于Cr6+到Cr3+或Cr2+物种在a-Cr2O3上分散的还原。因此，低温最大值的存在证实了Cr负载超过3.4 wt%的催化剂中存在a-Cr2O3。H2消耗随着Cr负载的增加直到6.8 wt% Cr，然后对于具有最高Cr含量的催化剂减少，而H2/Crtot的比率从0.7 wt% Cr增加到13.7 wt% Cr时，从1.46急剧下降到0.37。这种随着Cr负载增加而H2/Crtot比率的强烈下降是由于结晶a-Cr2O3的形成。分散的Cr物种主要负责在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢中丙烯的高产率。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium- controlled dehydrogenation."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."
[4] "Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [19],manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts."
[5] "On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the reverse watergas shift reaction (4)."
[6] "The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy- drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation."
[7] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[8] "However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts."
[9] "Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2 [1,2,6]."
[10] "The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system [5], while over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances."
[11] "It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved."
[12] "For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
[13] "Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [68], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (6001100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability."
[14] "In the present paper, we have reported the catalytic activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by the conventional impregnation method in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2."
[15] "The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments."
[16] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts."
[17] "This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2."
[18] "It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[19] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

1.The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been studied as an alternative to equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation, showing higher yields of propene. CO2 improves propene yield through two pathways: a redox mechanism involving chromium, manganese, vanadium, and iron oxide-based catalysts, and by facilitating the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward propene formation. Chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on various materials are highly active, but the support's nature significantly affects their dehydrogenation properties. CO2 has inhibitory effects on CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, but a promoting effect on CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/(oxidized diamond). High dispersion of chromium oxide species enhances activity in the presence and absence of CO2. High surface area materials like MCM-41, SBA-15, and MSU-x are used as supports for chromium species. MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts show good activity in propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2. The role of CO2 is explored through temperature-programmed reactions and TPR experiments. CO2 promotes propene yield in all studied catalysts, likely due to coupling with the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The high activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the reverse water-gas shift reaction contributes to the higher propene yield.

1.在二氧化碳存在下丙烷的脱氢反应已被研究作为对平衡控制脱氢的替代途径，显示出更高的丙烯产量。二氧化碳通过两种途径提高丙烯产量：涉及铬、锰、钒和铁氧化物基催化剂的氧化还原机制，以及通过促进逆水煤气变换反应，该反应去除氢气并使脱氢反应平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。基于各种材料支持的铬氧化物催化剂具有高度活性，但支持物的性质对它们的脱氢性质有重大影响。二氧化碳对CrOx/Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2催化剂有抑制作用，但对CrOx/SiO2和CrOx/(氧化金刚石)有促进作用。铬氧化物物种的高分散度在二氧化碳存在和不存在的情况下增强了活性。高表面积材料如MCM-41、SBA-15和MSU-x被用作铬物种的支持物。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中，无论二氧化碳是否存在，都表现出良好的活性。二氧化碳的作用通过温度编程反应和TPR实验进行探讨。二氧化碳在所有研究的催化剂中都促进了丙烯产量，这可能是由于与逆水煤气变换反应的耦合。MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在逆水煤气变换反应中的高活性是观察到的更高丙烯产量的额外原因。
