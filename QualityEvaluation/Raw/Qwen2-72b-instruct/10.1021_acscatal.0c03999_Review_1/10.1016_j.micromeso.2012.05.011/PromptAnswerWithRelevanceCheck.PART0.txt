1.The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

1.各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性可能因金属类型、负载量和支撑材料性质等因素而有很大差异。在支撑Cr2O3催化剂的情况下，铬物种的演变在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。在较低的Cr负载量（低于7 wt.%）下，存在分散的Cr5+物种，这些物种对丙烷脱氢为丙烯具有很高的活性。然而，在较高负载量（超过5 wt.%）下，形成结晶Cr2O3，其活性较低。Cr6+物种主要以单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐的形式存在，在反应过程中迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种，这些物种是脱氢的主要活性位点。在7 wt.% Cr负载量下，丙烷转化率（37.7%）达到最大，超过这一负载量，由于形成不活跃的Cr2O3，转化率保持不变。

In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties plays a key role in determining their catalytic performance.

At higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 particles begins, which are less active and can lead to a decrease in propane conversion. The optimal loading of Cr for CO2-ODHP appears to be around 7 wt.%, where the catalyst exhibits maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550 C. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture does not significantly affect the reduction of Cr6+ species to Cr2+/Cr3+ species, which are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

However, at higher Cr loadings (above 5 wt.%), the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 particles becomes more prevalent, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity due to the lower accessibility of the Cr atoms to the reactants. The Cr6+ species, present in all catalysts, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the dehydrogenation process, which are the main active sites for the reaction. The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions are available to the reactants under dehydrogenation conditions, regardless of the presence or absence of CO2. The optimal Cr loading for CO2-ODHP is around 7 wt.%, as this maximizes propane conversion while minimizing the formation of inactive Cr2O3 particles.
