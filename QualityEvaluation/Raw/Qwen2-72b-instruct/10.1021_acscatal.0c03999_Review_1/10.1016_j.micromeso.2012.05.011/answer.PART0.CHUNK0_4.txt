[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
[2] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
[3] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
[4] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
[5] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
[6] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
[7] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

1.The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP depend on factors such as the type of metal oxide, the loading of the active metal, and the properties of the support. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties plays a key role. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are beneficial for catalytic activity. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline a-Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Crx/SBA-1 catalysts show excellent activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation to propene in the presence of CO2, with a maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550 C for 7 wt.% Cr loading. The activity remains constant at higher Cr contents due to the formation of inactive crystalline Cr2O3. Operando UVvis DRS measurements reveal that Cr6+ species, the main redox sites, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the process, and these dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions are the main active sites under dehydrogenation conditions.

1.各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性取决于金属氧化物的类型、活性金属的负载量以及载体的性质。在Cr2O3载体催化剂的情况下，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变起着关键作用。在较低的Cr负载量（低于7 wt.%）下，存在分散的Cr5+物种，这对催化活性有益。然而，在较高负载量（超过5 wt.%）下，形成结晶的a-Cr2O3，其活性较低。Crx/SBA-1催化剂在CO2存在下表现出优异的活性和选择性，用于丙烷脱氢至丙烯，Cr负载量为7 wt.%时，丙烷转化率最高可达37.7%。在更高的Cr含量下，由于形成不活跃的结晶Cr2O3，活性保持不变。原位UVvis DRS测量表明，Cr6+物种，即主要的氧化还原位点，在过程开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种，这些分散的Cr2+/Cr3+离子在所有研究的进料组成下是脱氢条件下主要的活性位点。
