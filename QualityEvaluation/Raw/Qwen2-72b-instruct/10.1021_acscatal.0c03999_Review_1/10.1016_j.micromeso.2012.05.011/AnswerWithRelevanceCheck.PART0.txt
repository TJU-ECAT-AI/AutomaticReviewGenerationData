          [1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
          [2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
          [3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
          [4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
          [5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
          [6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
          [7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
          [8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
          [9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

          The activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal, the loading, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a key role in determining catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), dispersed Cr5+ species are present, which are highly active for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, at higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), crystalline Cr2O3 forms, which is less active. The Cr6+ species, present mainly as mono- and dichromates, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species during the reaction, which are the main active sites for dehydrogenation. The maximum propane conversion (37.7%) was achieved with 7 wt.% Cr loading, beyond which the conversion remained constant due to the formation of inactive Cr2O3.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性可能因金属类型、负载量和支持物性质等因素而有很大差异。在Cr2O3支持催化剂的情况下，铬物种的演变起着关键作用。在较低的Cr负载量（低于7 wt.%）下，存在分散的Cr5+物种，这对催化活性有益。然而，在较高负载量（超过5 wt.%）下，形成结晶的a-Cr2O3，活性较低。Crx/SBA-1催化剂在CO2存在下表现出优异的活性和选择性，用于丙烷脱氢至丙烯，Cr负载量为7 wt.%时，转化率最高（37.7%）。对于更高的Cr含量，由于形成不活跃的Cr2O3，丙烷的转化率保持不变。原位UVvis DRS测量表明，Cr6+物种，即主要的氧化还原位点，在过程开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种，这些分散的Cr2+/Cr3+离子在所有研究的进料组成下是脱氢条件下主要的活性位点。
