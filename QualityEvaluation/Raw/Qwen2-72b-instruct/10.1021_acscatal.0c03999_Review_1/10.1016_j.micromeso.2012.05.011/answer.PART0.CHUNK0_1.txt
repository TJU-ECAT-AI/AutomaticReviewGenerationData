[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
[3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
[4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
[5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
[6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
[7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
[8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
[9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

1.The catalytic activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of metal oxide, the support material, the loading of the active metal, and the reaction conditions. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties plays a key role in determining their catalytic performance. At lower loadings (below 7 wt.%), the catalysts contain dispersed Cr5+ species and Cr6+ species mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, which are highly active and selective for CO2-ODHP. At higher loadings (above 5 wt.%), the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 particles begins, which are less active and can lead to a decrease in propane conversion. The optimal loading of Cr for CO2-ODHP appears to be around 7 wt.%, where the catalyst exhibits maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550 C. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture does not significantly affect the reduction of Cr6+ species to Cr2+/Cr3+ species, which are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

1.各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化活性和选择性可能因金属氧化物的类型、载体材料、活性金属的负载量和反应条件等因素而有很大差异。在负载Cr2O3催化剂的情况下，铬物种随负载量和载体性质的演变对它们的催化性能起着关键作用。在较低负载量（低于7 wt.%）下，催化剂含有分散的Cr5+物种和主要以单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+物种，这些物种对CO2-ODHP具有高活性和高选择性。在较高负载量（高于5 wt.%）下，开始形成结晶Cr2O3颗粒，这些颗粒活性较低，可能导致丙烷转化率下降。对于CO2-ODHP，Cr的最佳负载量似乎约为7 wt.%，此时催化剂在550 C下的丙烷转化率最高，达到37.7%。反应混合物中CO2的存在对Cr6+物种还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种的过程影响不大，Cr2+/Cr3+物种是丙烷脱氢的主要活性位点。
