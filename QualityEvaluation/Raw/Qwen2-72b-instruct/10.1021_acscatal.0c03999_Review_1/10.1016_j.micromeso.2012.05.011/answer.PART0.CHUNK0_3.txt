[1] "A series of Crx/SBA-1 cubic mesoporous catalysts with 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 wt.% content of Cr (Crtotal) were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of SBA-1."
[2] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
[3] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."
[4] "The presence of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content."
[5] "Cr5+ species were found in the samples con- taining below 7 wt.% of Crtotal, while particles of crystalline a-Cr2O3 were detected in the catalyst with Crtotal content above 5 wt.%."
[6] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum pro- pane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
[7] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inac- tive in the test reaction."
[8] "Operando UVvis DRS measurements performed during the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2 at 550 C, indicated that the Cr6+ species (main redox sites) were reduced rapidly to Cr2+/Cr3+ species already at the beginning of the process."
[9] "The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main sites available to the reactants under the dehydrogenation conditions in all of the studied feed compositions."

1.The catalytic activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP can vary significantly depending on factors such as the type of metal oxide, the loading of the active metal, and the properties of the support material. In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties plays a key role in determining their catalytic performance. At lower Cr loadings (below 7 wt.%), the catalysts contain dispersed Cr5+ species and Cr6+ species mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, which are highly active and selective for CO2-ODHP. However, at higher Cr loadings (above 5 wt.%), the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 particles becomes more prevalent, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity due to the lower accessibility of the Cr atoms to the reactants. The Cr6+ species, present in all catalysts, are rapidly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the beginning of the dehydrogenation process, which are the main active sites for the reaction. The dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions are available to the reactants under dehydrogenation conditions, regardless of the presence or absence of CO2. The optimal Cr loading for CO2-ODHP is around 7 wt.%, as this maximizes propane conversion while minimizing the formation of inactive Cr2O3 particles.

1.各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化活性和选择性可能因金属氧化物的类型、活性金属的负载量以及支撑材料的性质等因素而显著不同。在支撑Cr2O3催化剂的情况下，铬物种随负载量和支撑材料性质的演变对它们的催化性能起着关键作用。在较低的Cr负载量（低于7 wt.%）下，催化剂含有分散的Cr5+物种和主要以单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+物种，这些物种对CO2-ODHP具有高活性和高选择性。然而，在较高的Cr负载量（超过5 wt.%）下，结晶Cr2O3颗粒的形成变得更加普遍，由于Cr原子对反应物的可及性降低，导致催化活性下降。Cr6+物种存在于所有催化剂中，在脱氢过程开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种，这些物种是反应的主要活性位点。分散的Cr2+/Cr3+离子在脱氢条件下对反应物可用，无论CO2是否存在。CO2-ODHP的最佳Cr负载量约为7 wt.%，因为这在最大限度地提高丙烷转化率的同时，最小化了非活性Cr2O3颗粒的形成。
