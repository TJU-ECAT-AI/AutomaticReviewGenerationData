1.The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP or a detailed analysis of the factors influencing their catalytic performance. However, it does discuss the preparation and characterization of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts using two different methods: direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The study indicates that the coordination structure and dispersion of chromium species on the support can significantly affect the catalytic properties. For instance, monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by DHT, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by TIE. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, with a selectivity to propylene higher than 90%. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. During the dehydrogenation reactions, the chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination. In contrast, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample prepared by DHT than that by TIE. The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample prepared by DHT.

1.该文件没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细分析影响其催化性能的关键因素。然而，它确实讨论了使用两种不同方法：直接水热合成(DHT)和模板离子交换(TIE)制备Cr-MCM-41催化剂。研究指出，铬物种在支撑物上的配位结构和分散度可以显著影响催化性能。例如，主要存在于DHT制备的Cr-MCM-41上的单铬酸盐物种，而几种类型的铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐，共同存在于TIE制备的Cr-MCM-41上。这两种样品在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中表现出相似的催化性能，丙烯的选择性高于90%。二氧化碳的存在增强了丙烷的转化。在脱氢反应中，两种样品上的铬酸盐物种被还原为具有八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。相比之下，氧气部分氧化甲烷时，DHT制备的样品对甲醛的选择性明显高于TIE制备的样品。在甲烷氧化过程中，铬酸盐物种的结构得以保持，高分散的单铬酸盐物种可能是DHT制备样品选择性更高的原因。
