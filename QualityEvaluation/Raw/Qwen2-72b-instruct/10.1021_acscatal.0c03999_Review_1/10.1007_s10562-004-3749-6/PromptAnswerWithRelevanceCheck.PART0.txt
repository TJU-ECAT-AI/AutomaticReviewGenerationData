1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does discuss the effect of support type (SiO2 vs Al2O3) on the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, while over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidity/basicity of the oxide support is suggested to play a significant role in the catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述Cr2O3负载催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。然而，它确实讨论了支持物类型（SiO2与Al2O3）对CrOx基催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应催化性能的影响。在CrOx/SiO2上，CO2增强了丙烯的产量，而在CrOx/Al2O3上，CO2存在时丙烯的产量和选择性降低。支持物的酸碱性被建议在负载铬催化剂的催化性质中起着重要作用。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP activity and selectivity, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does state that the nature of the support strongly influences the effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

The nature of the support strongly influences the catalytic performance. Over CrOx/SiO2, CO2 enhances propene yield, whereas over CrOx/Al2O3, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 decrease. The acidic/basic nature of the support seems to play a role in the effect of CO2 on the catalytic activity. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is not directly addressed, but the TPR results suggest that the oxygen is more strongly bound in the supported chromium catalysts than in bulk Cr2O3, and the effect of chromium loading on the CO2 poisoning/promoting effect is observed, with the ratio of yield in He to yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) increasing over CrOx/SiO2 with increased chromium loading, and decreasing over CrOx/Al2O3.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。但是，它确实讨论了支撑物对基于铬氧化物的催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢催化性能的影响。支撑物的性质强烈影响催化性能。在CrOx/SiO2上，CO2增强了丙烯的产量，而在CrOx/Al2O3上，CO2存在时丙烯的产量和选择性降低。支撑物的酸性/碱性似乎在CO2对催化活性的影响中起作用。关于支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和支撑物性质的关系，文献没有直接提及，但TPR结果表明，与块体Cr2O3相比，支撑铬催化剂中的氧结合得更牢固，而且观察到铬负载对CO2中毒/促进效果的影响，CrOx/SiO2上He与CO2的产量比(YHe/YCO2)随铬负载的增加而增加，而CrOx/Al2O3上则减少。
