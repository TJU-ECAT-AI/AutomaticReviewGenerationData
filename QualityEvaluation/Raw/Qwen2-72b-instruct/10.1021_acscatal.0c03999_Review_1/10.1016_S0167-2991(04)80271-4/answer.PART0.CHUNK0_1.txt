[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
[3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

1.Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8), and among them, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity and selectivity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 demonstrated a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of Cr-MCM-41 remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species in Cr-MCM-41 changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, forming small Cr3+Ox clusters. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

1.测试了各种金属氧化物催化剂用于CO2脱氢丙烷(C3H8)，其中Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性和选择性，其次是Ga，Ni，V，Fe，Mn和Co。Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41显示出超过15%的产率和高于90%的丙烯选择性。Cr-MCM-41的孔径在Si/Cr比为25时保持在2.7 nm，尽管随着Cr含量的增加，孔体积和表面积有所下降。C3H6的选择性始终高于90%，C3H8的转化率几乎随Cr含量的增加而线性增加，表明Cr是反应的活性位点。Cr-MCM-41中的铬物种在反应后从Cr6+的四面体配位变为Cr3+的八面体配位，形成小的Cr3+Ox簇。Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+Og八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上CO2与C3H8的脱氢中起着关键作用。
