[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
[3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

1.对于二氧化碳脱氢丙烷反应，Cr-MCM-41表现出最高的活性，其次是Ga，Ni，V，Fe，Mn和Co。Si/Cr=50的Cr-MCM-41显示出超过15%的产率和高于90%的丙烯选择性。孔径在Si/Cr比为25时保持在2.7 nm，尽管孔体积和表面积随着Cr含量的增加而减少。C3H6的选择性始终高于90%，C3H8的转化率几乎线性地随着Cr含量的增加而增加，表明Cr是反应的活性位点。在反应过程中，Cr6+的四面体配位被改变为Cr3+的八面体配位。Cr6+C>4四面体和Cr3+Og八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上的C3H8与CO2的脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
