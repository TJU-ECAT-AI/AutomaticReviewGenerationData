[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
[3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
[4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[5] "In the results of Fourier transforms of -weighted CriC-edge EXAFS (Fig. 6, a & b), a single peak was observed before reaction and could be assigned to the bond of Cr-O, consisting of two Cr=O bonds and two Cr-0 bonds in Cr6+O4 tetrahedra. After the reaction, two distinct peaks were observed at 1.60 and 2.63 A (non-phase-shift corrected). Similar two peaks were also Fig. 4. O2 treatment of deactivated catalysts. observed for Cr 2C>3 or Cr/Cab-O-Sil, and as described above in the results of diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of Cr/Cab-O-Sil sample these two peaks could be assigned to the bonds of Cr-0 in Cr3+O6 octahedra and Cr-O-Cr through edge-shared Cr3+O6 octahedra."
[6] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
[7] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
[8] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

The chromium species in the catalyst changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and this change in coordination structure correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation.

1. Cr-MCM-41在CO2脱氢C3H8反应中表现出最高的活性，其次是Ga，Ni，V，Fe，Mn和Co。Si/Cr=50的Cr-MCM-41显示出超过15%的产率和高于90%的丙烯选择性。C3H6的选择性始终高于90%，C3H8的转化率几乎随Cr含量的增加而线性增加，表明Cr是反应的活性位点。催化剂中的铬物种在反应后从四面体配位的Cr6+变为八面体配位的Cr3+，这种配位结构的变化与失活和再活化现象相关。四面体配位的Cr6+在脱氢中起着重要作用。
