          [1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41- DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
          [2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
          [3] "The results of CO2 dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 DHT with various Cr contents at 550 C are shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
          [4] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak,and the edge position shifted to lower energy,suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
          [5] "However, the peak in the vicinity of 3.29 A (non-phase-shift corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium species exist as small Cr3+Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction, although it is difficult to determine the size of the clusters."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."
          [7] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES and the EXAFS spectra showed the preedge peak and the single peak,respectively,suggesting that Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation (Figs. 5 & 6, c)."
          [8] "The curve-fitting results for Cr-0 shell confirmed that the coordination structure of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral even after 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation."
          [9] "These changes in the coordination structure well correlated with the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation shown in Fig. 4. It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

          Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 had a yield above 15% and a high selectivity above 90% for propene. The pore diameter of MCM-41-DHT remained constant at 2.7 nm up to a Si/Cr ratio of 25, despite decreases in pore volume and surface area with increasing Cr content. Chromium species in the synthesized samples exist as small Cr3+ oxide clusters, which transform to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ after calcination. The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90%, and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, indicating that Cr is the active site for the reaction. The chromium species changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, and Cr6+O4 tetrahedra regenerated by the reoxidation after treatment with O2. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

          Cr-MCM-41在CO2脱氢丙烷反应中表现出最高的活性，其次是Ga，Ni，V，Fe，Mn和Co。Si/Cr=50的Cr-MCM-41具有超过15%的产率和高于90%的丙烯选择性。MCM-41-DHT的孔径在Si/Cr比为25时保持在2.7 nm不变，尽管随着Cr含量的增加，孔体积和表面积有所下降。合成样品中的铬物种以小的Cr3+氧化物簇存在，这些簇在煅烧后转变为具有四面体配位Cr6+的铬酸盐物种。C3H6的选择性始终高于90%，C3H8的转化率几乎线性地随着Cr含量的增加而增加，这表明Cr是反应的活性位点。反应后，铬物种从四面体配位的Cr6+变为八面体配位的Cr3+。在O2处理后，Cr6+O4四面体通过再氧化再生。Cr6+C>4四面体和Cr3+Og八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上CO2与C3H8的脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
