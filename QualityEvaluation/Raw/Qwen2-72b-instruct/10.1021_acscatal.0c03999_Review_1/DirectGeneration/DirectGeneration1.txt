The comprehensive evaluation of metal oxide catalysts for the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is a critical area of research, spanning from initial screening to detailed analysis, with a particular emphasis on chromium-based catalysts. This evaluation process begins with a broad screening phase, where a variety of metal oxides are tested for their catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability under CO2-ODHP conditions. From this initial pool, chromium-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates due to their unique ability to activate CO2 and propane molecules. The subsequent in-depth analysis focuses on understanding the performance factors that govern the catalytic activity, such as the effect of metal loading, support type, and reaction conditions. Additionally, the evolution of active species during the reaction is closely monitored, providing insights into the mechanism of CO2-ODHP over chromium oxides. Structure-activity relationships are also explored, linking the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts, such as surface area, acidity, and electronic structure, to their catalytic performance. This systematic approach not only enhances our understanding of chromium-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP but also guides the rational design of more efficient and selective catalysts for this and other important reactions.
