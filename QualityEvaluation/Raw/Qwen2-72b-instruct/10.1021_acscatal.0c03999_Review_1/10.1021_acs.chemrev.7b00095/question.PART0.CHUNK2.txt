In another study, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration. (297) The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv. The utility of these sorbents for natural gas sweetening at higher H2S concentrations needs to be investigated. In yet another study, linear PEI was dispersed inside the meso-channels of a SBA-15 framework, allowing interaction of amine groups in PEI with silanol groups on SBA-15. (298) The breakthrough and saturation capacities increased with inlet H2S concentrations of 2000, 4000, and 6000 ppmv in the ranges 0.68, 1.18, 1.48 and 1.50, 2.06, 2.38 mmol/g, respectively. The saturation value for amine-grafted sorbents at 1000 ppmv is 0.56 mmol/g. (292) So unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA. This is an open question that can be addressed perhaps by molecular simulations. The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence. However, moisture also resulted in a decrease in H2S desorption rates. The same authors also studied the effects of the operating temperature (2275 C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; 3371011 h1), amount of PEI loading, and different molecular sieve supports (MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15). (299) The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity. A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity. The amount of PEI loading has a strong synergetic influence on the sorption performance: 50 wt% PEI on SBA-15 gives the best breakthrough capacity, while 65 wt% PEI on SBA-15 shows the highest saturation capacity. The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. In addition, the developed sorbents can be regenerated easily at mild conditions (75100 C), with sorption capacity maintained over eight cycles.
The studies discussed so far did not involve H2S adsorption in the presence of CO2, which is known to be much more acidic compared to H2S. Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process. (300) These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C. The authors proposed a two-stage process, with the first column being operated at 75 C for CO2 removal and the second column at 22 C for H2S removal (see Figure 13). Yoosuk and co-workers carried out similar two-stage studies for PEI loaded on low-cost fumed silica (fSi) and also investigated regeneration studies over multiple cycles. (301) Although the authors observed high breakthrough capacities for both CO2 and H2S for pure-component adsorption at 80 and 30 C, respectively, in the mixture adsorption with two-column configuration, the working capacity of CO2 was enhanced from 2.2 to about 3.5 mmol/g, while that of H2S decreased from the expected 1.2 to about 0.05 mmol/g. This reduced performance for H2S compared to the system introduced by Ma et al. can be attributed to two factors: (i) the difference in CO2 and H2S pure-component adsorption at 22 C for PEI/SBI-15 is much higher compared to the difference at 30 C for PEI/fSi, and (ii) the mixture feed contained a very high concentration of CO2 (20%) compared to H2S (0.36%) in the work of Yoosuk et al.; these values were 2.4% and 0.40%, respectively, for the work of Ma et al. These differences demonstrate the importance of choice of process conditions in selecting optimal sorbents. Similar to the discovery of novel zeolites for natural gas purification through a combined material screening and process optimization approach, (302) process optimization in materials selection for supported amines can help discover optimal sorbents.

In spite of these exciting properties, the powder nature of ordered mesoporous silica inhibits its direct usage in industrial packed columns due to very high pressure drops. Chen et al. investigated hierarchical porous silica supports for PEI. They can be easily formed as monoliths, which can be directly used in the fixed bed without any shaping process. (303) The largest breakthrough capacity of these sorbents was 1.27 mmol/g, about 60% higher than that of PEI/SBA-15 (0.79 mmol/g) or MCM-41 (0.81 mmol/g), although the test for the former was carried out at a lower inlet H2S concentration and a higher GHSV. (299) A new parameter, polymerization degrees of PEI (423, 600, 15000, 750000), was investigated, and it was found that the sorbent with a PEI molecular weight of 600 had the best sorption property. The authors propose that PEI with higher polymerization degree should have very large steric hindrance and low fluidity, restraining the internal diffusion of H2S and lowering the amine utilization, while PEI (423), a mixture of linear monomers and branch polymers, may be partially consumed or volatilized during the impregnation and drying, resulting in the decrease of efficient amine groups.
Belmabkhout et al. studied triamine-grafted (CH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2) pore-expanded mesoporous silica (TRI-PE-MCM-41) for adsorption of dry CO2, H2S, and CH4 and found a much higher affinity for CO2 and H2S compared to CH4 (see Figure 14). (304) Binary SH2S/CO2 varied from 70 to 10 upon varying the H2S concentrations from 5 to 100 ppm. (305) These materials thus provide a promising solution to single-step H2S and CO2 removal. Such simultaneous removal is desirable if re-injection of concentrated sour gas stream into empty gas fields is preferred over conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur by the Claus process. H2S adsorption isotherms in the temperature range of 2580 C are available from two different studies, and both predict an isosteric heat of adsorption between 40 and 20 kJ/mol with increasing loading; the low-loading heats of adsorption can be as high as 100 kJ/mol.

Another Class 1 adsorbent study employed SBA-15 loaded with hexamethylenetetraamine for H2S removal from a stream containing 9000 ppm H2S in CH4; the highest loading was observed for 50 wt% amine loading with a capacity of 0.75 mmol/g, stable over 10 cycles when overnight regeneration was conducted using N2 at 100 C. (307) In general, all sorbents in this category can be fully regenerated under mild temperature conditions and are shown to maintain a constant capacity for several cycles in most of the studies. Efforts toward reducing the regeneration time will increase the productivity of these sorbents.
3.6.3 Zeolite/Polymer
Bhandari et al. developed hollow fibers with polymer binder, impregnated with high loadings of sulfur-selective zeolite sorbent fillers (see Figure 15). (308) Cellulose acetate formed the binder and zeolite NaY formed the filler for these hollow fibers with high sorbent loadings and good strength. Although the hollow fiber morphology is representative of contact in a membrane process, it should be noted that the fibers here are used as adsorbents. The fibersorbent morphology was characterized using equilibrium sorption, gas permeation, SEM, and EDX. These sorbents were shown to be very effective for low-concentration (30 ppm) H2S removal, especially when compared to a packed-bed process, and were found to be fully regenerable by application of heat (120 C under N2).

3.6.4 MetalOrganic Framework/Graphite Oxide
It was envisioned that the GO and MOF composites would increase the dispersive forces in a highly porous MOF structure via dense nanoporous GO layers (546 wt%). (186) Petit and co-workers studied GO composites with HKUST-1 and found a synergistic effect on sorption capacity (9 mg/g for GO, 92 mg/g for HKUST-1, and 199 mg/g for composite with 5 wt% GO). The breakthrough capacities measured at room temperature using 1000 ppm H2S in moist air were not found to correlate with the measured porosity of the composites, suggesting a mechanism in addition to physisorption contributing to the overall sorption. Indeed the adsorbent bed changed color from light blue (hydrated copper) to black (CuS). Ebrahim et al. found that adsorption capacities increased by 85% for composites with sulfur-doped graphite due to the presence of moisture compared to dry conditions. (309) Those authors suggested that, under moist conditions, water acts as a screening factor, blocking the direct attack of H2S/SO2 on the copper centers and preserving the structure to some degree. They found that the catalytic effect of the modified graphene phase results in the formation of SO2 with a much higher H2S breakthrough capacity of 241  6 mg/g.
In another study, Huang et al. prepared composites using MOF-5 and GO in the presence of glucose. (310) GO enhanced the dispersive forces in MOF-5, as demonstrated by higher H2S uptake, but beyond the optimal loading of 5.25%, GO led to collapse of the MOF crystal structure. At 5.25% GO loading, composites with and without glucose have surface areas of 1062 and 295 m2/g, respectively; the respective breakthrough capacities of these materials using 100 ppm H2S in N2 are 130.1 and 31.9 mg/g. The authors suggest that glucose can restrain the distortion of the composite material due to polymerization of glucose under hydrothermal conditions; these short polymers fill in the structure to support the framework, and some may even react with the functional groups on the GO (see Figure 16). While this approach provides a route to stabilize such composite materials, performance and structural reversibility of these sorbents on regeneration need to be investigated.

3.6.5 Metal (Hydr)oxide/Graphite Oxide
Several studies report on the Claus reaction between H2S and air on composites of metal (hydr)oxide and GO, (312-323) with breakthrough H2S capacities as high as 150 mg/g of adsorbent at 1000 ppm H2S in air. Lonkar et al. demonstrated an easy in situ fabrication of nanostructured graphene/CuO (324) and graphene/ZnO (311) composites without the use of any solvents, toxic-reducing agents, or organic modifiers. The metal oxide particles in the presence of graphene had a size of sub-20 nm, compared to metal oxide particles of 50 nm synthesized by the same method (see Figure 17). At ambient temperature and with a feed composition of 0.15% H2S, 0.41% CO2, and 99.4% CH4, a 50 wt% composite material led to over twice the capacity of pristine ZnO (see Table 10). Regeneration of these high-capacity materials with the advantage of easy synthesis is an important aspect that should be considered in the future.

3.6.6 Metal Oxide/Activated Carbon
Fauteux-Lefebvre et al. embedded iron nanoparticles in carbon nanofilaments and tested these for H2S removal under a wide range of operating conditions. (325) Fe K-edge spectra showed that iron was in its oxidized states (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). Even at higher temperature of 300 C, low breakthrough capacities were observed. Higher metal loadings of 28 wt% could not improve the H2S uptake (see Table 11). Zhang and co-workers studied various loadings of MnO2 on AC under a wide range of synthesis and operating conditions and observed capacities as high as 110 mg/g for a 50 wt% MnO2 loading at only 20 ppm H2S. (326) In another study, sorbents were prepared by finely dispersing mixed ZnO and CuO onto a commercial AC at fixed total metal loading (10 wt%) and Cu:Zn atomic ratios ranging from 0:1 to 1:1. (327) The surface area was hardly affected due to the high dispersion of the metal oxides; moderately high H2S capacities could be achieved. Only 1827% of the capacity could be regenerated at 400 C, and even at a temperature of 620 C, only 4046% of the capacity could be regenerated.

This becomes particularly important for H2S-removal applications, since contact of an improperly disposed adsorbent with air or water may result in a concentrated release into the environment and can have very serious health implications. Some of the spent metal oxides, such as iron sulfide, can be pyrophoric and can release acid gases into the atmosphere. Dissolution of these gases in water bodies can have unacceptable effects on the ecosystem. Some of the methods for treating spent adsorbents include regeneration followed by inert purge, flooding with liquid water, and steam purging. (328) The cost of an adequate spent-adsorbent treatment method may have large bearings on this additional cost. 4 Membrane Separation As natural gas consumption is expected to nearly double in the coming 25 years and the raw natural gas has a varying composition depending on its origin, there is an opportunity for membrane technology to remove impurities including water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfides, and other hydrocarbons. (329) Bhide and Stern investigated the relative economics of cellulose acetate (CA) membrane technology and gas absorption using DEA and found that the membrane process for CO2 removal is more economical to meet the 2% specification over the entire range of CO2 feed concentrations (>5%). (330) Presence of H2S in the feed stream resulted in an increased separation cost for meeting the specifications of both H2S and CO2 (4 ppm and 2%, respectively). Unlike the superior performance of membranes over the entire range of acid gas concentration for CO2 alone, the presence of H2S allowed membranes to be economical only at higher total acid gas (H2S + CO2) concentrations. While this analysis was carried out for CA membranes with SCO2/CH4 = 21 and SH2S/CH4 = 50, (330) it should be noted that the SH2S/CH4 values for such membranes range between only 15 and 30. Membranes with higher selectivities and permeabilities than the CA membranes employed in this economic analysis may significantly expand the regime for superior membrane performance over gas absorption. Additionally, hybrid processes involving membranes for bulk acid gas removal, followed by chemical absorption or adsorption in the polishing step, can drive the overall process toward better economics.
4.1 Polymeric Membranes
Approximating solubility with the Henrys law and diffusivity with the Ficks law, and approximating the concentrations on the permeate side to be negligible compared to that on the feed side, the permselectivity of a polymer membrane, Sij, in differentiating two species, i and j, can be expressed as (7) where Pi, Fi, pi, Di, and Ki are the permeability, flux, partial pressure, Ficks diffusion constant, and Henrys constant for species i. The ratio Di/Dj can be viewed as the transport selectivity indicating the relative speed of the two components and is mainly governed by the molecular shapes and sizes. The ratio Ki/Kj can be viewed as the sorption selectivity and is governed by the relative gas solubilities in the membrane material.
The glass transition temperature, Tg, characterizes the range of temperatures over which a hard and relatively brittle glassy amorphous state of the polymer transitions into a soft and viscous rubbery state. Polymer chains are trapped in a frozen state at T < Tg, but T > Tg allows for significant motion of the chains. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation by virtue of differential diffusivity; in contrast, rubbery polymers suffer reduced size selectivity from increased elasticity of the polymer chains. The kinetic diameters of H2S (3.6 Å) and CO2 (3.3 Å) are smaller than that of CH4 (3.8 Å); this suggests the possibility of a diffusion-based selectivity. The critical temperatures for these gases are 373, 304, and 191 K, respectively, suggesting that, compared to methane, the acid gases will interact more strongly with the polymer and also allow for sorption-based selectivity. Although both rubbery and glassy polymers can separate CO2 and H2S from natural gas, in practice, CO2 is best separated by glassy polymer membranes (maximizing size selectivity), whereas H2S, which is larger and more condensable than CO2, is best separated by rubbery polymer membranes (maximizing sorption selectivity). (331) Although plants based on glassy CA membranes (Tg  110 C) are widely used for CO2 removal from natural gas, these membranes also possess SH2S/CH4  1530. (332-334) The contribution of diffusion and sorption to this overall selectivity is unclear; H2S/CH4 sorption isotherms will help understand the relative proportions of the two factors. Using CA to reduce H2S to pipeline specifications (4 ppm) results in vast over-processing as far as the CO2 concentrations are concerned. Thus, just like liquid absorbents with a higher H2S/CO2 selectivity, there is a need for membranes with higher SH2S/CO2.
Permselectivity can be obtained either from a real mixture experiment or by modeling mixture transport using pure-gas permeabilities and sorption isotherms. While it is most common to report the ideal selectivity (ratio of pure-gas permeabilities), it may be possible to adopt a more sophisticated approach to include the effects of multi-component sorption and diffusion. (335, 336) It is well known in the literature that the assumption of ideality grossly over-predicts selectivity for polymeric membranes if one of the species strongly absorbs/adsorbs onto the polymer. Absorption-induced swelling of the polymer increases chain mobility and gas flux, a phenomenon commonly known as membrane plasticization. Increased chain mobility lowers Tg, potentially transforming a membrane from glassy to rubbery and adversely affecting the size-selective term, Di/Dj. CO2-induced swelling of CA membranes results in a much lower CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity compared to the ideal selectivty (35 vs 50 at 4 atm); the effect is more pronounced at higher CO2 partial pressures (32 vs 80 at 12 atm). (337) Other impurities, such as light hydrocarbons, water, very low concentration of aromatics, etc., can also have a plasticization effect on membrane permeances. In addition to plasticization, glassy materials suffer from physical aging where the polymer chains slowly relax into a preferred high-density form by a reduction in free volume. (338) This type of aging effect can reduce membrane permeabilities significantly over the average 25-year life of a membrane used in natural gas service. (331) Kulprathipanja et al. synthesized two-component membranes comprising of a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) plasticizers, having molecular weights between 200 and 600, cast upon a porous polysulfone (PSf) support that was pre-treated with glycerol. (340, 341) Glycerol alters the pores of the support, thus increasing the permeability of hydrogen-bonding H2S (see Table 12). These membranes are of the asymmetric type; a very thin, dense surface layer or skin is supported upon an integrally attached, much thicker supporting layer. In this case, the selective skin is rubbery, while the support is glassy. The authors reported very high H2S/CH4 ideal selectivities between 115 and 185; however, the mixed gas selectivities measured later are smaller by a factor of 48. (344, 363) Both PDMS and PEG belong to the class of rubbery membranes with Tg = 127 and 67 C, respectively; therefore, it is unlikely that plasticization results in lower mixture selectivities. It is possible, however, that these strongly absorbing membranes are being operated at both feed and permeate pressures in the saturated loading regime. Several studies report ideal and mixture H2S/CH4 selectivities in PDMS membranes of 11, (341, 342, 362) indicating the crucial role of PEG plasticizers in enhancing the selectivity toward H2S. Unlike CA and PDMS membranes, these two-component membranes present high SH2S/CO2 as well, possibly by benefitting from the hydrogen-bonding character of H2S. However, this raises concerns about the influence of H2O impurities on such membranes, and this can be additionally important considering that PEG is soluble in H2O. Molecular simulations can possibly explain the role of PEG and also the influence of impurities on membrane performance.

Various grades of Pebax membranes have been tested for acid gas removal, and these membranes yield ideal and mixture SH2S/CH4 values in the ranges 140190 and 3570, respectively. (333, 343, 344, 359) Similar to PDMS and PEG, the Pebax membranes also belong to the class of rubbery membranes with Tg < 50 C; as mentioned earlier, the drop in mixture selectivity compared to ideal selectivity may be due to operation in the saturated loading regime. These membranes demonstrate SH2S/CO2 between 3.4 and 4.5. The presence of H2O impurities was examined by using a feed gas stream saturated with H2O vapor; no detrimental effect on the selectivities was observed, but the fluxes decreased by 4045%. (364) Chatterjee et al. synthesized two poly(ether urethanes) and two poly(ether urethane ureas) using PEG or poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) for the ether block; the polyurethanes are structurally related to the Pebax polymers. (333) Membranes with PEG blocks yield much higher H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities compared to the ones with PPG blocks, but with no significant difference in the permeabilities; this maybe attributed to the higher mass fraction of polar hydroxyl groups in PEG compared to PPG. Very high selectivities reaching up to 100 for H2S/CH4 and 4.8 for H2S/CO2 were observed by reducing the temperature from 35 to 20 C.Yet another class of rubbery membranes that offer high selectivity for H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 separation (6080 and 49, respectively) are substituted polyphosphazenes (PPZ), where the substituents are predominantly 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (MEE) and 4-methoxyphenol. (349, 350) Orme et al. explained that the flexible backbone of PPZ has a low rotational energy barrier due to pπdπ bonding between nitrogen and phosphorus. Polyether pendant groups, such as MEE, are linear chains of sp3-hybridized atoms which have many degrees of rotational freedom; thus, they do not significantly hinder the inherent flexibility of the backbone. (350) On the other hand, aromatic substituents hinder the backbone flexibility, in turn increasing Tg. This work showed a surprising result that lowering Tg resulted in increased permeabilities and separation factors at the same time. Similar ideal and mixture selectivities suggest that these rubbery membranes are operated in the regime where the polymer is not saturated with the more strongly absorbing gas molecules: the operating pressure is only 2.1 bar as opposed to several tens of atmospheres for previously mentioned mixture experiments. MEE is hydrophilic and makes the PPZ hydrophilic; at 100% MEE substitution, the resulting PPZ is soluble in water. In contrast, aromatic substituents impart hydrophobicity. The effect of moisture in the feed stream on the performance of PPZ membranes remains to be investigated. These 100200 μm thick membranes were supported on ceramic supports with 0.2 μm pores. Permeation properties of thin membranes are very different from those of thick films, and since the selective layer of membranes in industrial use is usually only 0.11.0 μm thick, (365) performance for thinner substituted-PPZ membranes remains to be seen.Quinn and co-workers have explored facilitated transport membranes for selective removal of H2S from natural gas mixtures. (345, 346) These membranes are based on the polyelectrolyte, poly(vinylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium fluoride) (PVBTAF), and show exceptionally high mixture selectivity for selective removal of H2S and CO2 from CH4 (>800 and >400, respectively). Using NMR data, the authors show that CO2 reacts with hydrated fluoride ions to form mobile bicarbonate ions, HCO3. The permeance of both CO2 and H2S increased with decreasing feed partial pressure of the respective gases, a phenomenon observed for membranes operated in the saturated loading regime; permselectivity data imply that both CO2 and H2S compete for the same reaction sites, hydrated fluoride ions. (345) The authors also report that the membranes show no deterioration after 30 days of continuous operation but react irreversibly with trace levels of sulfur-containing contaminants, such as CS2 and COS, that are common to cylinder H2S. The permselectivity of these membranes was increased by 34 times without reduction in selectivity by using fluoride-containing salts such as cesium fluoride. (346) The performance of these membranes is very sensitive to the relative humidity of the feed stream.Unlike conventional microporous materials such as zeolites and activated carbon, polymeric materials possess advantageous properties, such as solution-processability and precise control over chemical functionality. However, polymeric membranes suffer from large inherent densities and, as a result, low permeabilities in general. Budd and co-workers developed a new class of polymeric membranes that not only are solution-processable but also possess intrinsic microporosity. (366) This new class of materials, known as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), are a result of contorted shape and extreme rigidity of planar units fused together by rigid spirocyclic linkers. These kinks at the spiro-centers prevent efficient packing to form a dense polymer matrix, which in turn results in a material with intrinsic microporosity. (367) These materials are microporous (pores smaller than 2 nm) and possess a considerable fraction of pores that are below 7 Å. (368) Hydroxyl-functionalized PIMs (PIM-6FDA-OH) demonstrated higher permeabilities than most traditional polyimides for sour gas sweetening application. (360, 369) Annealed PIM-6FDA-OH films were shown to resist plasticization up to much higher pressures compared to unannealed films and other 6FDA-based polyimide materials. These films were dried under vacuum at 100 C to remove any moisture prior to testing. However, since processed natural gas, although with low dew point temperatures, may contain finite moisture levels, future research for these very promising, but hydrophilic, membranes should consider the effects of moisture on gas sweetening.Several other research groups have been investigating polymeric membranes for H2S removal, from the 1950s right up until today, (334, 339, 347, 348, 351-359, 361, 370-373) and the data from some of these papers is also presented in Table 12. To maximize the membrane area per unit volume, two main configurations are widely used: hollow fibers and flat sheets in the form of spiral-wound modules. Both these module types are commercially applied for CO2 removal from natural gas. (331)
4.2 Membranes for GasLiquid Contact
In general, synthesizing highly selective gas membranes that also offer high flux is an active area of industrial and academic research. An alternative technology that combines the advantages of high surface area per unit volume of membrane contactors with the selective absorption in amine-based liquid solutions was first developed for CO2 capture in 1985 by Qi and Cussler. (375, 376) Such gasliquid interfaces may be achieved by flowing a gas on the outside of a membrane configuration such as a hollow fiber and with liquid flowing within its lumen (see Figure 18). These gasliquid membrane contactors offer several advantages over conventional contacting devices, such as high surface area per unit contactor volume; independent control of gas and liquid flow rates without any flooding, loading, weeping, foaming, or entrainment problems; small size; known gasliquid interfacial area; and being modular and easy to scale up or down. (377) Important aspects of membrane contactors for acid gas removal, including liquid absorbents, membrane characteristics, combination of membrane and absorbent, mass transfer, and membrane modules, are critically discussed elsewhere by Mansourizadeh and Ismail. (377) Figure 18 Figure 18. Cross section of a hollow fiber (gas on the shell side and liquid on the tube side). P and C are the gas partial pressure and liquid concentration, respectively. The subscripts gb, gm, lm, and lb represent gas bulk, gasmembrane interface, liquidmembrane interface, and liquid bulk, respectively. Reprinted with permission from ref 374. Copyright 2016 Elsevier.Asymmetric hollow-fiber membrane modules made of PSf and PESf, coupled with a concentrated alkaline NaOH solution, were investigated both experimentally and theoretically for the removal of H2S (see Table 13). (378) In general, the gas-phase diffusivity is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the liquid-phase diffusivity. As a result, in the case of non-reactive absorption, the additional mass-transfer resistance contributed by a non-wetted membrane is significantly smaller than the resistance in the liquid phase. Thus, addition of a non-wetting membrane to a non-reactive gasliquid system results in a negligible decrease in the overall mass-transfer coefficient. A non-wetting solventmembrane combination can therefore greatly enhance the overall mass transfer (Koverall × ) of the soluble species from the gas phase to the liquid phase by virtue of higher surface area per unit volume (). Since reactive absorption in many cases shifts the rate-limiting step to the gas phase, having a wetted membrane can be beneficial over a non-wetted membrane in such cases. These are general guidelines and may vary from case to case, depending on the extent of equilibrium between a gasliquid pair. In a subsequent study, Li et al. developed a PVDF membrane, and due to its excellent chemical resistance, much higher H2S feed concentration could be investigated. (379) Unlike other membrane-based processes such as ultra-filtration or molecular sieving, very small pressure gradients need to be maintained across the gasliquid interface, just enough to prevent bubbling of the gas in the liquid phase, since the driving force for mass transfer is the chemical potential (concentration) gradient. The effect of an alternate alkaline medium such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was also investigated, and complete removal of H2S could be achieved with short residence times (<0.1 s). (380) H2S removal in the presence of CO2 showed SH2S/CO2 = 180200, about 1 order of magnitude higher than that reported for packed towers (1030). (381) Note that here the selectivity is defined as the ratio of overall mass-transfer coefficients for H2S and CO2 and may vary with the operating conditions of the packed tower and the membrane module. With the hollow fibers, the selectivity increased by 33% for a 6-fold increase in gas/liquid ratio and by 50% for a 3-fold increase in gas pressure, and was insensitive to the inlet concentration of CO2 over a wide range (525%).

Marzouk et al. explored expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) hollow fibers for removal of high-concentration H2S from a binary gas mixture (2% H2S in CH4) at high pressures (up to 50 bar). (382, 384) PTFE is a highly non-reactive polymer, mainly due to the strong strength of carbonfluorine bonds; this non-reactivity allows the polymer to withstand highly corrosive H2S environments. Additionally, fluorocarbons are known to be very hydrophobic, thus repelling water or water-containing solutions and in turn preventing wetting of the hollow fibers. It was observed that the ratio of flux in the case of NaOH solution to that in the case of distilled water (a physical absorbent) decreases from 4.5 at 1 bar to 1.35 at 50 bar. This seemingly small effect of alkaline solution at higher pressure amounts to 75% H2S removal for water and 100% H2S removal for 2 M NaOH solution. Performance for MEA was observed to be vey similar to that for NaOH. H2S flux rates were obtained with three different amines, i.e., MEA, DEA, and triethylenetetraamine (TETA), and it was shown that the flux followed the order TETA > MEA > DEA. TETA has four amino (Lewis base) sites, explaining its having the largest H2S flux. The steric hindrance in MEA is lower compared to that in DEA, allowing better interaction of the Lewis base site with H2S. The effect of simultaneous absorption of CO2 and H2S from a pressurized CO2H2SCH4 gas mixture was investigated using ePTFE and a commercially available diblock polymer, poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluorinated alkyl vinyl ether) (PFA). (384) The results proved that the PFA fibers are superior to the more common ePTFE mainly because of their smaller dimensions, higher porosity, and higher hydrophobicity. Utilizing PFA fibers in the future would lead to substantial reduction in the membrane area (10 times) and/or significant enhancement in the acid gas removal efficiency. Since the contact angles for ePTFE and PFA are 111.3 and 118.6, respectively, it is quite possible that a polymer with even higher hydrophobicity may further increase the membrane flux.
While liquid-phase resistance dominates mass transfer in the case of physisorption, (384) the gas-phase resistance dominates for reactive absorption in the liquid phase. (383) An increase in amine concentration in the absence of CO2 resulted in a decrease in the mass-transfer coefficient, and this was attributed to the enhanced wetting of the membrane resulting from reduced surface tension due to organic amines. (383) In the presence of CO2, however, MDEA concentration enhanced the removal efficiency of H2S as well as CO2; since MDEA is a tertiary amine, the CO2 molecules are not absorbed and stay in the gasliquid interface within the membrane, hindering the wetting of the membrane. The effect of temperature on the H2S removal efficiency was small, but it substantially decreased the CO2 removal efficiency and consequently enhanced the H2S selectivity. (383) Absorbent mixtures as well as acid gas mixtures affect the H2S and CO2 removal efficiencies in complex ways. While the logic presented in the paper by Hedayat et al. makes sense, there are multiple phenomena going on in this system at the same time, and it is hard to deconvolute the problem; insights from molecular simulations, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium, can play a role in improving the understanding of the underlying phenomena.
Recently, Esquiroz-Molina et al. studied the effect of pH for alkaline NaOH solution on the mass transfer of H2S in commercially available hollow-fiber membrane contactors made of hydrophobic polypropylene. (386) Theoretical gas side residence times were varied between 0.37 and 17 s, while the liquid side residence time was about 12 s. The authors determined a threshold pH of 10 (104 M), above which the reaction could be described as pseudo-first order with respect to H2S due to an excess of reactive hydroxide ions. At pH > 10, the reactive absorption in the liquid phase increases the liquid-side mass-transfer coefficient enough to make the reaction gas-phase controlled. The authors propose a NaOH pH of 11 (0.001 M) to be economically attractive; this value is several orders of magnitude smaller than the concentrations previously investigated in the literature. It should be noted, however, that dilute solvents can reduce the cost of solvents but will greatly increase the regeneration cost of the spent absorbent. Such a reduction in concentration may be justifiable only for a very high value solvent.
Several groups have modeled H2S removal using gasliquid contact over hollow-fiber membrane modules. (387-394) Some of the models considered non-wetting and partial wetting conditions, where the gas mixture and the solvent, respectively, fill the membrane pores. (388, 394) Axial and radial diffusion were considered inside the fiber, through the membrane, and within the shell using a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model. (388) This 2D model was modified to account for the reversible reactions of all species involved in the chemical absorption of H2S in aqueous carbonate solution (389) and then further extended to systems involving the presence of CO2. (390) Amrei et al. presented a comprehensive model considering the entrance regions of momentum, energy, and mass transfers; compressibility of the gas phase as a function of gas-phase temperature, pressure, and composition; and variation of physical solubility of CO2 and H2S as a function of gasliquid interface temperature, pressure, and compositions. (393) Dynamic response of the membrane reactor to various types of pulses on the feed and solvent showed that the system was dynamically stable and reverted back to its previous operating point. It is worth noting that the modeling of flow in hollow-fiber contactors is not trivial. Inside the fiber, the assumption of a fully developed laminar parabolic velocity profile in a tube geometry works very well. However, due to poor knowledge of the shell-side geometry, the models for what happens on the outside of the hollow fibers may correlate one set of data but are rarely effective in general. (395, 396) Another issue about hollow-fiber membranes that is not addressed in many studies is the unstable gasliquid interface. To overcome this, Prasad and Sirkar put a higher static pressure on the phase which did not wet the membrane, pushing the interface back to a more stable location. (397) However, this may not work as well for polydisperse pores, and it is an issue that, if not addressed at the design stage, may lead to considerable performance problems in actual practice.
In conclusion, hollow-fiber membrane contactors have shown some promise for selective H2S removal; especially the uncommon H2S/CO2 selectivities are promising. A better understanding of the flow patterns may be obtained from reactive computational fluid dynamics. This will enable further insights into whether operating and design parameters such as wettability of the membrane have positive or detrimental effects in optimizing not only H2S capacity but also H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities.
4.3 Ceramic Membranes
Ceramic membranes have the potential to precisely control transport properties of molecules with different sizes, shapes, and interaction strength, in turn allowing sieving at molecular length scales. Maghsoudi and Soltanieh investigated the simultaneous separation of H2S and CO2 from CH4 using a ceramic membrane of CHA-type zeolite. (398) Since polar impurities such as H2O, due to their large permanent dipole moments, may affect membrane performance, there is a considerable value attached to exploring high-silica zeolite membranes. An approximately 20 μm thick silica membrane was synthesized on a porous α-alumina disk, with repeating the crystallization process thrice to seal defects as judged from N2 permeability tests. The elemental profiles for Al and Si along the cross section by EDX line scanning view showed that the zeolite layer has Si/Al  5. Before the actual permeance measurement, the feed and permeate sides were purged for 1 h with the desired feed and Ar, respectively, and Ar was also used as a carrier gas during the permeation measurements. Ternary mixture (2.13% CO2, 0.30% H2S in CH4) permeance was measured at room temperature, and the ratios of permeances for H2S/CH4 and CO2/CH4 were observed to be 3.24 and 5.3, respectively. When normalized by the ratio of feed concentrations, these values are 1050 and 240, respectively, suggesting that the potential for acid gas separation using zeolite membranes should be further explored.
4.4 Carbon-Based Membranes
Pristine graphene is a two-dimensional, single-atomic-layer, hexagonal lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that is completely impervious to liquids and gases, including atoms as small as helium (2.6 Å). (399) Perforated graphene membranes with sub-nanometer micropores, also known as porous graphene membranes, have shown promise for numerous separation applications. (400-408) Nanoporous defect formation in single-atomic layers of graphene using high-resolution TEM was reported by Hashimoto et al. (409) In another approach, bottom-up synthesis has also been demonstrated using phenylene rings as building units to form porous graphene. (410) Although porous graphene membranes have been explored for the selective molecular sieving of He, H2, CO2, Ar, O2, N2, CO, and CH4, there is no experimental measurement for H2S, which should be explored in the future.
It is important to note here that a successful gas separation using a single-layer graphene membrane has not been reported. Most measurements are for a few-layers-thick graphene oxide membranes. This is likely to have strong implications on separations involving polar species such as H2S due to the different binding affinities of polar species toward pristine graphene surface compared to the functionalized surface of graphene oxide. Lei et al. carried out MD simulations to probe the effect of the charges around the pore on the separation of a H2S/CH4 mixture using a porous graphene membrane. (411) The pore was formed by deleting 12 C atoms from the center of the sheet in the simulation box, and partial charges of 0.241 and +0.241 e were assigned to the carbon atoms in the first and second 12-carbon shells. For the charged-pore membrane, the flux nearly doubled for H2S and nearly halved for CH4, resulting in a 4-fold increase in selectivity compared to the uncharged-pore membrane. In another simulation study, Sun et al. investigated different pore sizes and shapes for graphene membranes and found H2S/CH4 selectivities in excess of 100 at reasonably high permeances. (412) Another class of carbon-based membranes, carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes, which are prepared by the carbonization of polymeric precursors, have shown promising CO2/CH4 selectivity (35190) at high CO2 flux of 106108 mol/(m2·s·Pa). (413, 414) The utility of such membranes for selective H2S removal from natural gas streams remains to be explored.
Very recently, Wenz and Koros introduced a postsynthetic modification method using aromatic amines to bridge the sp2 domains in CMS membranes with the goal to prevent relaxation of the CMS to suppress physical aging (see Figure 19). (415) However, the modifications were found insufficient to yield aging-resistant membranes. This is an emerging field, and hopefully new synthetic techniques to prevent collapsing of CMS will emerge in the future.

Gilani and co-workers used vertically aligned CNT (VACNT) membranes, (416) functionalized with different amine groups, for separation of binary H2S/CH4 mixtures (see Figure 20). (417) Permselectivity values between 2.5 and 3 and H2S permeabilities between 3 × 107 and 8 × 107 mol/(m2·s·Pa) were observed, depending on the choice of functional groups. Linear amines with a short carbon chain length lead to a higher selectivity and H2S permeability; the order of selectivity and H2S permeability of membranes was obtained as butylamine > dodecylamine > sec-butylamine > octadecylamine.

Controlling aggregation of individual carbon membrane units, ensuring uniformity of thickness, and tuning precise distribution of defects are important challenges in the area of carbon-based membranes that are still not fully mature. Goh et al. have recently reviewed carbon-based membranes with a focus on water purification and identified five strategic areas for future research, namely, concentration polarization, fouling, stability, scalability, and cost. (252) Stacked graphene and surface-modified graphene are much more stable and scalable compared to single-layer graphene. Similarly, randomly aligned CNTs are more scalable compared to VACNT. Like in most research fields, even in carbon-based membranes, the pursuit of advanced performance faces competing characteristics such as scalability, stability, and cost-effectiveness.
4.5 Composite Membranes
Supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) consist of an IL embedded in a solid polymer matrix (support). SILMs with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the IL for its superior affinity to acidic gases, and PVDF as the polymer matrix for its hydrophobicity as well as stable physical and chemical properties, were tried for selective H2S removal. (418, 419) The permeability coefficients increased dramatically, especially for H2S, with an increase in the IL content of the membrane. This increase may be due to enhancement in diffusion, since solubility does not vary much with IL loading.
Wang et al. computationally studied the separation of an H2S/CH4 mixture in the UiO-66(Zr)-(COOH)2 MOF membrane and the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) composed of polymer as the continuous phase and MOF as the dispersed phase. (420) GCMC simulations using generic force fields that are known to show reasonable adsorption estimates for MOFs were used to obtain equilibrium loading at the conditions of interest. MD simulations were then employed to calculate diffusivities considering framework flexibility, and equivalent results were obtained from simulations in the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles. With a combination of atomistic simulations and the MaxwellStefan formulation for permeation, (421) H2S/CH4 permselectivities of 200 for UiO-66(Zr)-(COOH)2, 250 for the different polymers, and between 2 and 60 for MMMs were estimated. Note that, for modeling the separation performance of MMMs, the permeability values of H2S/CH4 mixtures through polymeric membranes were taken from the experimental data available in the literature, while those through the MOF phase were taken from the simulation results. It was found that, for polymers with much lower H2S permeabilities compared to the MOF, MOF addition into its matrix increases the permeability by about an order of magnitude for 50% volume fraction of the MOF and the selectivity remains almost unchanged at the polymer permselectivity. However, for polymers with H2S permeabilities not lower than 2 orders of magnitude compared to the MOF permeability, both selectivity and permeability of the polymer increase upon MOF addition. In a subsequent study, Li et al. carried out molecular simulations using generic MOF force fields (shown to have worked reasonably accurately in many previous studies) to study the adsorption and membrane performance of UiO-66(Zr) and its functionalized derivatives for H2S removal from binary mixtures with CH4 and CO2. (422) UiO-66-(COOH)2 and UiO-66-COOH performed better than other functionalized derivatives; however, the performance of these adsorbents/membranes containing hydrophilic functional groups, in the presence of moisture, remains to be seen. 5 Cryogenic Distillation Although the phase behavior of the CH4/H2S system was studied extensively in the 1950s, (423-425) there has been renewed interest in the study of these systems at additional state points, especially at higher pressures, in the past couple of years. (426-428) Coquelet et al. investigated phase equilibria from 87 to 40 C up to 140 bar, (426) and Perez et al. measured the mixture densities between 20 and 20 C and up to pressures of 300 bar. (428) Lange et al. also explored the complete pT diagram of the methanehydrogen sulfide system down 70 K and for pressures up to 2500 bar by tuning the parameters within a solidliquidvapor equation of state and validating against the available experimental data. (427) Total, Institut Francais du Petrole, and its fully owned subsidiary, Prosernat, have developed a cryogenic process for bulk H2S removal from very sour gases, the SPREX (Special PRe-Extraction) process. (429) The pre-treatment step reduces the H2S content in the gas by producing a partially sweetened gas which can then be processed by a smaller sized amine sweetening unit; it also produces high-pressure liquid H2S (5065 bar) that can be easily re-injected into a geological reservoir. The minimum overhead temperature is limited to about 30 C, so as to remain above the hydrate formation temperature, ruling out the necessity of installing a dehydration unit upstream of the Sprex column. This temperature of 30 C limits the H2S concentration in the distillate to about 10%. However, the authors also describe an enhanced version, where the temperature can be reduced to 65 C without crystallizing CO2 or H2S, thereby reducing the H2S content in the overhead stream to 23%. The triple point of H2S is about 85 C, suggesting that the process is very close to where it can practically be, even if pre-drying is carried out to completely remove the moisture.
For many chemical separations, distillation has been the most straightforward and often long-lasting choice, unless an obvious better choice of separation was available. It is intriguing that, in the development of separation processes for gas sweetening, distillation has come into the picture only in the past decade or so. Distillation, in general, is a very energy-intensive process that requires boiling and condensing of the entire feed stream (a number of times for systems with low relative volatilities). However, for a raw gas stream (4.5 million S·m3/day) containing 35% H2S and 7% CO2, the capital expenditure, power consumption, and steam consumption of the amine process and the SPREX + amine process were reported to be 153 and 128 MM US$, 52 and 30 MW, and 46 and 34 MW, respectively. (429) This shows that distillation can indeed be more cost-effective and energy-efficient as a pre-treatment step, compared to amine absorption, for bulk acid gas removal. (429) 6 Outlook and Perspectives Considering the wide range of hydrogen sulfide concentrations in different natural gas reservoirs, a need for a portfolio of efficient (multi-step) separation processes is evident. In addition to H2S removal, other competing goals such as CO2 removal, removal of other organic sulfur compounds, and moisture removal need to be considered where necessary. Before one can quantitatively compare many of the emerging materials described in this Review, further detailed investigations of these materials under conditions of interest (as discussed at appropriate places throughout the Review) are essential.
As far as liquid absorbents are concerned, processes based on alkanolamines have matured and been perfected over the past several decades. New research on amines for acid gas capture is evolving around developing solid supports, such as mesoporous silica, to uniformly disperse the amine functionalities, either physically or chemically bonded by silane chemistry, and to benefit from the advantages of adsorptive separations over absorptive separations. Since CO2 is more acidic than H2S, developing H2S-selective alkanolamines was a big challenge that was overcome for liquid absorbents. Similar breakthroughs for supported amines will be essential for efficient H2S capture. One such promising attempt employs variations in the operating conditions for a two-column setup: the first column at high temperature for absorption of CO2, and the second column at low temperature for removal of H2S without over-processing for CO2. (300) Adsorbents where aminopolymers are polymerized in situ on a porous support have not yet been tried for H2S capture, and this could constitute an important future investigation.
Ionic liquids are an emerging class of absorbents for selective acid gas removal; emphasis on understanding their structure and performance should remain the focus of fundamental investigations, and cost comparisons with commercial liquid solvents will help understand the true potential of these new liquids for sweetening applications. Deep eutectic solvents are another new class of absorbents; although these are explored only for CO2 capture as of today, future studies may investigate H2S removal using these solvents. In addition to the performance metrics of capacity and selectivity, operational aspects, such as lowering the viscosity and aquatic toxicity of these new classes of solvents, are also likely to play an important role in the development of these new technologies.
Mixed metal oxides for reactive H2S removal have evolved empirically in most cases, and very little is known in the literature about the fundamental mechanisms governing improved performance. Some progress has been shown in the ZnO and CuZnO mixed oxide sulfidation mechanisms using TEM and in situ synchrotron XRD. An even better understanding of these reaction mechanisms may assist in designing mixed oxides with not only a high degree of regenerability but also structural reversibility on regeneration. The latter is more important for a stable bed performance over the life of the adsorbent. Some of the MOFs investigated in the literature have shown very high H2S capacities. Knowledge of thermal conductivities and specific heats of these materials becomes essential in the design of adsorption beds involving high exothermicity. In case of cation-exchanged zeolites, structural characterization of metallic species to elucidate whether these are located at catalytic ion-exchange sites or just as extra-framework metal oxides should help in understanding the performance on more fundamental grounds. Most literature studies on utilizing solids for mass separation focus on designing sorbents with higher selectivities and capacities; emphasis should also be levied on factors such as structural and performance regenerability, stability in the presence of strongly adsorbing/reacting impurities, heats of adsorption, specific heat capacities, and thermal conductivities. Future adsorbent screening should try to incorporate these diverse properties in the selection criteria.
Significant development has occurred in the scientific and technological improvement of polymeric membranes for sour gas sweetening. Synthesis and performance studies of thin membranes made from some of the promising polymeric materials should be undertaken in order to asses the potential of these membranes for commercial application. There is only one report in the literature using zeolitic membranes for H2S separation; (398) the results from this study seem to be promising and should be explored further. Use of porous graphene and carbon molecular sieve membranes for H2S capture also constitute an area of future investigation in the field. Mixed-matrix membranes composed of MOFs dispersed in polymeric materials have been modeled using theory and simulations. Experimental and theoretical development of these next-generation membranes for gas sweetening will remain the research focus for the next decade or so.
Sulfur is mainly used in the production of sulfuric acid. Other uses of sulfur include manufacture of vulcanized rubber, building materials, inorganic chemicals, dyes, skin treatment ointments, matches, explosives, fertilizers, agrochemicals, fungicides, and fumigants. It is also useful in the bleaching of paper, extraction of minerals, and processing of wastewater. In recent years, increased processing of highly sour gas fields in the Middle East regions has resulted in a large surplus of sulfur, and research is being focused on developing new commercial applications of sulfur, such as battery materials and increased sulfur content of common plastics and building materials. Thus, the overall economics of highly sour gas wells may depend not only on the economics of acid gas removal but also on what one decides to do with the sulfur. Whether one can find high-value applications for sulfur, or store mountains of sulfur as inventory for future increase in demand, or maybe even re-inject the H2S gas into depleted wells are the different aspects that may influence the choice of an H2S-removal process. Detailed economic analysis of competing bulk H2S removal processes, such as polymeric membrane separations, cryogenic distillation, all-silica zeolitic adsorbents, and combinations thereof, may help researchers arrive at the commercially optimal solution.
