The
 effect
 of  CO2 on  the activity  for  the  dehydrogenation
 of  C3H8 over  Cr/SiO2 and  Cr/Al2O3 prepared
 by
impregnation
 method
 was  investigated.
 The
 activity
 of  Cr/SiO2 was  enhanced
 with  increasing
 the partial
pressure
 of  CO2,  while  the activity
 of  Cr/Al2O3 was  remarkably
 reduced
 by  the  addition
 of  a  small
 amount
of
 CO2.  Kinetic
 analysis
 suggested
 that  CO2 adsorbed
 on  Al2O3 inhibited
 the  adsorption
 of  C3H8,  and  that
CO2 reduced
 the  activity
 of  Cr/Al2O3.  Cr  K-edge
 XAFS  spectra
 and  TPR  proﬁles
 indicated
 that
 the  redox
cycle
 between
 Cr(III)O6 and  Cr(VI)O4 had  an  important
 role  in  the dehydrogenation
 of  C3H6 over
 both
Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 regardless
 of  the  support.
 CO2 could  oxidize
 a  part  of
 Cr(III) species
 to  Cr(VI)  species
under
 the  reaction
 condition.
 As  a result,  in  the  case  of Cr/SiO2,  the oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of  C3H8
over  Cr(VI)
 species
 took  place
 in  addition
 to  the  simple
 dehydrogenation
 over  Cr(III)
 species.

 Introduction
Catalytic
 conversions
 of
 alkanes
 into
 the
 corresponding
 alkenes
are
 of
 increasing
 importance
 because
 of
 the
 growing
 demand
 for
alkenes.
 Silica-
 and
 alumina-supported
 chromium
 oxides
 were
industrially
 used
 for
 the
 productions
 of
 lower
 alkenes
 such
 as
ethene,
 propene,
 and
 isobutene
 through
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
the
 corresponding
 alkanes
 [1,2].
 The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 alkanes
is
 endothermic
 and
 inevitably
 controlled
 by
 the
 thermodynamic
equilibrium,
 requiring
 substantial
 energy
 consumption.
 Cr-based
catalysts
 have
 also
 been
 investigated
 for
 the
 oxidative
 dehydro-
genation
 of
 lower
 alkanes
 [3–9],
 or
 oxidation
 of
 other
 organic
compounds
 with
 oxygen
 [10],
 however,
 the
 use
 of
 oxygen
 as
 an
oxidant
 is
 frequently
 accompanied
 by
 deep
 oxidation,
 resulting
 in
a
 decrease
 in
 product
 selectivity.
Recently,
 CO2 has
 received
 much
 attention
 as
 a
 co-feed
 gas
for
 the
 dehydrogenation,
 because
 CO2 can
 also
 act
 as
 a
 mild
 oxi-
dant,
 and
 utilization
 of
 carbon
 dioxide
 in
 some
 partial
 oxidation
reactions,
 such
 as
 CO2 reforming
 of
 methane
 [11–13]
 and
 oxida-
tive
 coupling
 of
 methane
 [14],
 has
 been
 reported.
 CO2 was
 found
to
 enhance
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 lower
 alkanes
 and
 ethylben-
zene
 over
 Cr-based
 catalysts
 [15–25]. However,
 the
 role
 of
 CO2
in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 and
 the
 mechanism
 of
 this
 reaction
 are
still
 under
 discussion.
 In
 this
 study,
 we
 investigated
 (1)
 the
 kinetic
analysis
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2 over
 Cr/SiO2

Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 prepared
 by
 impregnation
 of
 SiO2
(700
 m2 g−1),
 which
 was
 prepared
 from
 TEOS
 (tetraethyl

(Cr(NO3)3·6H2O)
 and
 calcined
 at

 with
 about
 350–380

 In
order
 to
 estimate
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
 formed
 on
 the
 catalyst
 dur-
ing
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8,
 TG–DTA
 analysis
 were
 done
 by
using
 Rigaku
 Thermo
 plus
 TG

 The
 catalysts
 after
 the
 dehydro-
genation
 of
 C3H8 with
 CO2 and
 without
 CO2 at
 823
 K
 for
 5
 h
 were
analyzed
 at
 a
 heating
 rate
 of
 5
 K
 min−1 using
 a
 mixture
 of
 20
 vol.%
O2/N2 as
 oxidizing
 gas
 (50

2.2.
 Catalytic
 properties
The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 with
 CO2 and
 reverse
 water–gas
shift
 (RWGS)
 reaction
 was
 examined
 to
 gain
 the
 information
 of
 cat-
alytic
 properties
 of
 Cr-based
 catalysts.
 These
 reactions
 were
 carried
out
 using
 a
 ﬁxed-bed
 ﬂow
 reactor
 (quartz
 tube
 with
 inner
 diameter
of
 6
 mm)
 operated
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure.
 In
 the
 dehydrogenation
and
 reverse
 water–gas
 shift
 reactions,
 typically
 0.2
 g
 of
 sample
 was
loaded
 into
 the
 reactor
 and
 pretreated
 in
 a
 gas
 ﬂow
 containing
 N2
(10
 ml
 min−1)
 and
 O2 (10
 ml
 min−1)
 at
 823
 K
 for
 1
 h
 and
 then
 purged
with
 He
 (purity,
 99.99%).
 The
 products
 in
 each
 reaction
 were
 ana-
lyzed
 by
 on-line
 gas
 chromatographs
 (FID:
 Shimadzu
 GC14B
 and
TCD:
 Shimadzu

 Results
3.1.
 Catalytic
 properties
 of
 Cr-based
 catalysts
In
 order
 to
 clarify
 the
 contribution
 of
 CO2 to
 the
 reaction,
 the
effect
 of
 the
 partial
 pressure
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 catalytic
 activities
 of
Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 investigated
 and
 the
 results
 are
 shown
 in
Fig.
 1.
 Although
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 also
 took
 place
 in
 the
absence
 of
 CO2,
 the
 conversion
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr/SiO2 was
 enhanced
with
 an
 increase
 of
 the
 partial
 pressure
 of
 CO2.
 The
 presence
 of
CO2 also
 slightly
 improved
 the
 selectivity
 to
 C3H6.
 On
 the
 contrary,
the
 activity
 of
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 remarkably
 reduced
 by
 the
 addition
 of
a
 small
 amount
 of
 CO2.
 The
 reaction
 orders
 of
 partial
 pressure
 of
CO2 over
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 were
 estimated
 to
 0.14
 and
 −0.16,
respectively.
 Therefore,
 the
 active
 species
 of
 Cr/SiO2 seems
 to
 be
basically
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 Cr/Al2O3,
 however,
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
the
 catalytic
 activity
 was
 contrastive.
Fig.
 2
 shows
 the
 effect
 of
 partial
 pressure
 of
 C3H8 over
 the
 cat-
alytic
 activities
 of
 Cr/SiO2.
 The
 conversion
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr/SiO2 was
enhanced
 with
 an
 increase
 of
 the
 partial
 pressure
 of
 C3H8.
 The
 con-
version
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 also
 improved
 with
 an
 increase
of
 the
 partial
 pressure
 of
 C3H8.
 The
 reaction
 orders
 of
 partial
 pres-
sure
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 were
 estimated
 to
 0.65
and
 0.59,
 respectively.
 These
 results
 suggest
 that
 CO2 and
 C3H8
competitively
 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 catalysts
 and
 that
CO2 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/Al2O3 remarkably
 inhibited
 the
 adsorption
 of
propane.
 Al2O3 is
 generally
 regarded
 as
 acidic
 rather
 than
 basic.
However,
 participation
 of
 basic
 sites
 in
 the
 catalytic
 behavior
 of
Al2O3 is
 often
 indispensable
 [26–28].  CO2–TPD
 proﬁles
 of
 Cr/SiO2
and
 Cr/Al2O3 showed
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 CO2 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/Al2O3
was
 larger
 than
 that
 on
 Cr/SiO2 (see
 supporting
 information
 Fig.
 S1).
This
 supports
 that
 the
 interaction
 between
 CO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 was
stronger
 than
 that
 between
 CO2 and
 Cr/SiO2.
3.2.
 Coordination
 structure
 of
 chromium
The
 change
 in
 valence
 and
 coordination
 environment
 of
chromium
 during
 the
 reaction
 was
 investigated
 by
 Cr
 K-edge
 XAFS
spectra.
 Fig.

 shows
 the
 Cr
 K-edge
 XANES
 spectra
 of
 reference
compounds,
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3.
 Chromium
 atoms
 in
 Na2CrO4,
K2Cr2O7,
 and
 CrO3 with
 Cr(VI)
 are
 all
 in
 tetrahedral
 coordination
whereas
 those
 in
 Cr2O3 with
 Cr(III)
 are
 octahedrally
 coordinated
with
 oxygen.
 The
 pre-edge
 peak
 at
 ca.
 5991

 is
 attributed
 to
 the

 transition
 is
 principally
 allowed
 when
 the
 chromium
center
 is
 in
 a
 noncentral
 symmetric
 environment
 or
 through

of
 3d
 and
 4p
 orbitals
 caused
 by
 the
 breakdown
 of
 inversion
 sym-
metry
 due
 to
 structure
 distortion
 [29].
 Since
 the
 local
 symmetry
around
 the
 metal
 center
 is
 lowered
 from
 octahedral
 to
 tetrahedral
coordination,
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 pre-edge
 peak
 tends
 to
 increase
simultaneously,
 i.e.,
 Ioctahedral <
 Isquare
 pyramidal <
 Itetrahedral [30].
 Fig.
 3
clearly
 shows
 that
 the
 compounds
 with
 tetrahedrally
 coordinated
chromium
 exhibit
 remarkably
 higher
 intensity
 of
 the
 pre-edge
peak.
 Cr
 K-edge
 XANES
 spectra
 of
 these
 reference
 compounds
 also
reveals
 that
 the
 edge
 position
 shifts
 with
 the
 change
 in
 oxidation
state;
 the
 edge
 position
 for
 Cr2O3 with
 Cr(III)
 is
 at
 5997.6
 eV,
 while
those
 for
 CrO3,
 K2Cr2O7,
 and
 Na2CrO4 with
 Cr(VI)
 shift
 to
 6006.0,
6006.3,
 and
 6004.6
 eV.
 The
 XANES
 results
 for
 these
 reference
 com-
pounds
 shown
 here
 are
 very
 similar
 to
 those
 previously
 reported
[20,21,31,32].
 According
 to
 Cr
 K-edge
 XANES
 spectra
 of
 Cr/SiO2,
the
 pre-edge
 peak
 was
 clearly
 observed
 before
 the
 reaction,
 while
this
 pre-edge
 was
 signiﬁcantly
 weakened
 after
 the
 reaction
 and
 the
edge
 position
 shifted
 to
 lower
 energy.
 These
 results
 indicated
 that
the
 Cr(VI)
 in
 CrO4 tetrahedron
 were
 reduced
 to
 Cr(III)
 in
 CrO6 octa-
hedron
 during
 the
 reaction.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 Cr/Al2O3,
 the
 pre-edge
peak
 was
 clearly
 observed
 before
 the
 reaction,
 while
 this
 pre-edge
was
 signiﬁcantly
 weakened
 after
 the
 reaction
 and
 the
 edge
 position
shifted
 to
 lower
 energy,
 indicating
 that
 the
 Cr(VI)
 in
 CrO4 tetrahe-
dron
 over
 Cr/Al2O3 were
 also
 reduced
 to
 Cr(III)
 in
 CrO6 octahedron
during
 the
 reaction
 as
 well
 as
 Cr/SiO2.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 feature
of
 the
 oscillation
 in
 the
 region
 higher
 than
 absorption
 edge
 (around
6010–6040
 eV)
 was
 different
 from
 that
 of
 Cr/SiO2,
 suggesting
 that
the
 local
 symmetry
 of
 chromium
 atom
 over
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 slightly
different
 from
 that
 over
 Cr/SiO2.
The
 Fourier
 transforms
 of
 k3-weighted
 Cr
 K-edge
 EXAFS
 spec-
tra
 of
 the
 reference
 compounds
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 are
 shown
in
 Fig.
 4.
 Three
 main
 peaks
 at
 1.6,
 2.6,
 and
 3.3 ˚
A
 (non-phase-shift
corrected)
 were
 observed
 for
 Cr2O3,
 and
 these
 three
 peaks
 corre-
sponded
 to
 the
 bonds
 of
 Cr–O
 in
 CrO6 octahedron,
 Cr–O–Cr
 through
edge-shared
 CrO6 octahedron,
 and
 Cr–O–Cr
 through
 corner-shared
CrO6 octahedron,
 respectively
 [33].
 For
 CrO3,
 K2Cr2O7,
 and
 NaCrO4
with
 Cr(VI)
 in
 CrO4 tetrahedron,
 the
 main
 peak
 for
 the
 Cr–O
 bond
was
 observed
 at
 1.20–1.35 ˚
A (non-phase-shift
 corrected),
 coincid-
ing
 with
 the
 shortened
 bond
 distance
 of
 Cr–O
 in
 CrO4 tetrahedron.
The
 intensity
 of
 the
 EXAFS
 oscillation
 for
 CrO3 was
 quite
 weaker
than
 those
 for
 Na2CrO4,
 K2Cr2O7,
 and
 Cr2O3 (data
 not
 shown),
 sug-
gesting
 the
 disorder
 of
 the
 CrO4 tetrahedron
 in
 CrO3.
 The
 peak
 of
the
 Cr–O
 bond
 was
 observed
 at
 1.23 ˚
A
 (non-phase-shift
 corrected)
in
 the
 Fourier
 transforms
 of
 k3-weighted
 Cr
 K-edge
 EXAFS
 spec-
tra
 of
 Cr/SiO2 before
 the
 reaction.
 This
 peak
 was
 assignable
 to
 the
bond
 of
 Cr–O
 in
 CrO4 tetrahedron.
 After
 the
 reaction
 (0.5
 h,
 Fig.
 4(A)
(a)),
 two
 distinct
 peaks
 appeared
 at
 1.6
 and
 2.6 ˚
A.
 These
 two
 peaks
are
 assignable
 to
 the
 bond
 of
 Cr–O
 in
 CrO6 octahedron
 and
 Cr–O–Cr
through
 edge-shared
 CrO6 octahedron.
 The
 increase
 in
 the
 intensity
of
 the
 latter
 peak
 indicates
 that
 aggregation
 of
 Cr
 species
 took
 place
during
 the
 reaction.
 However,
 the
 peak
 in
 the
 vicinity
 of
 3.3 ˚
A
 was
relatively
 weak
 as
 compared
 with
 that
 for
 Cr2O3.
 Thus,
 it
 is
 reason-
able
 to
 consider
 that
 the
 chromium
 species
 exist
 as
 small
 Cr(III)O6
clusters
 after
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 These
 XAFS
 results
suggests
 that
 Cr(VI)O4 species
 were
 rapidly
 reduced
 to
 Cr(III)O6
species
 and
 then
 converted
 to
 an
 aggregated
 form
 of
 the
 CrO6 octa-
hedron
 slowly
 during
 the
 reaction.
 Similar
 to
 the
 XANES
 results,
the
 change
 in
 the
 Fourier
 transforms

 This
suggests
 that
 the
 local

 of
 chromium
 atom
 over
 Cr/Al2O3
changed
 in
 the
 same
 way
 as
 the
 Cr/SiO2 regardless
 the

Since

 this

 suggests
 that
 all
 of

 When

 after

 at

 a
 H2

 in
 the

 to

 These
 temperatures
 of
 H2

 peaks
 were
 about
 100
 K
 lower
 than
 that
 of
 Cr/SiO2.
This
 indicates
 that
 Cr(III)
 species
 over

 be
 oxidized
easier
 than
 those
 over
 Cr/SiO2.
 The
 H2 consumption
 evaluated
 from
the
 area
 of

 was
 about
 40%
 of
 that

Therefore,
 it
 seems
 that
 the
 redox
 cycle
 between
 Cr(III)
 and
 Cr(VI)
was
 involved
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 with
 CO2 regardless
of
 the

 although
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 activities
 of
 Cr/SiO2
and
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 contrastive.

 Discussion
Up
 to
 now,
 two
 possibilities
 have
 been
 mainly
 proposed
 for
explaining
 the
 promoting
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
lower
 alkanes
 such
 as
 C2H6 and
 C3H8 over
 several
 catalysts.
 The
presence
 of
 CO2 was
 found
 to
 reduce
 the
 carbon
 deposition
 and
 to
assist
 in
 the
 rapid
 desorption
 of
 C2H4 from
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 in
the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C2H6 over
 a
 Ga2O3/TiO2 [34].
 Wang
 et
 al.
identiﬁed
 that
 CO2 could
 act
 as
 oxidant
 for
 the
 coupling
 of
 CH4
to
 C2 hydrocarbons
 over
 a
 variety
 of
 binary
 oxides
 [35–37].  It
 has
been
 reported
 that
 CO2 may
 provide
 oxygen
 species
 for
 the
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 C2H6 over
 a
 supported
 Cr2O3 [38]
 and
 C3H8 over
 a
NiMoO4 [39].
 One
 of
 the
 present
 authors
 found
 that
 HCHO
 could
be
 produced
 with
 signiﬁcant
 amounts
 on
 Cr-MCM-41
 in
 the
 par-
tial
 oxidation
 of
 CH4 with
 oxygen,
 although
 the
 oxidation
 of
 CH4
over
 the
 supported
 chromium
 oxide
 such
 as
 CrOx/SiO2 resulted
 in
complete
 combustion
 of
 CH4 [20].
 Based
 on
 this
 result,
 one
 of
 the
present
 authors
 proposed
 that
 the
 enhancement
 of
 dehydrogena-
tion
 of
 C3H8 to
 C3H6 over
 Cr-MCM-41
 was
 caused
 by
 the
 donation
of
 oxygen
 species
 by
 CO2.

The

 for

 of

 Proposed

 and
 presence
 of
 CO2 (B).
Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 under
 CO2 atmosphere
 than
 under
 N2 atmo-
sphere.
 This
 result
 strongly
 suggests
 that
 the
 suppression
 of
 coke
formation
 was
 not
 main
 role
 of
 CO2 over
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3.
 Coke
can
 be
 formed
 more
 intensively
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 from
 C3H6
than
 from
 C3H8,
 and
 therefore
 the
 enhanced
 formation
 of
 C3H6 over
Cr/SiO2 reasonably
 resulted
 in
 a
 larger
 amount
 of
 coke
 formation.
It
 was
 clearly
 observed
 that
 CO
 was
 produced
 from
 CO2 during
the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3.
 It
 must
be
 noticed
 that
 CO2 can
 be
 converted
 to
 CO
 via
 reverse
 water–gas
shift
 reaction
 by
 consuming
 H2 (Eq.
 (1))  or
 via
 Boudouard
 reaction
by
 consuming
 coke
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 (Eq.
 (2)):
H2 +
 CO2 =
 CO
 +
 H2O
 
(1)
C
 +
 CO2 =

(2)
The
 behavior
 of
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 is
 similar
 to
 those
 of
V2O5/MgO
 [40]
 and
 Cr-MCM-41
 [20],
 on
 which
 CO2 could
 not
 sup-
press
 the
 coke
 formation.
 It
 is
 likely
 that
 coke
 formed
 from
 C3H6,
the
 formation
 of
 which
 in
 high
 concentration
 possibly
 resulted
 in
enhanced
 coke
 formation.
The
 CO2 conversion
 in
 reverse
 water–gas
 shift
 reaction
 on
Cr/Al2O3 was
 slightly
 higher
 than
 that
 on
 Cr/SiO2 (see
 supporting
information
 Fig.
 S2).  On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
activity
 for
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 on
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 negative,
whereas
 that
 on
 Cr/SiO2 was
 positive
 (Fig.
 1).
 H2O–TPD
 proﬁles
 of
Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 (see
 supporting
 information
 Fig.
 S3)  showed
that
 water
 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/Al2O3 more
 strongly
 than
 Cr/SiO2.
 These
results
 suggest
 that
 (1)
 water
 strongly
 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/Al2O3,
 and
that
 (2)
 the
 activity
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 was
 reduced
 by
the
 competitive
 adsorption
 of
 C3H8 and
 water
 (and/or
 CO2).
 On
 the
other
 hand,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Cr/SiO2,
 it
 seems
 that
 a
 part
 of
 hydrogen
was
 eliminated
 by
 reverse
 water
 gas
 shift
 reaction.
4.2.
 Redox
 cycle
 of
 Cr
 species
 and
 effect
 of
 support
The
 activity
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 in
 the
 absence
 of
CO2 over
 Cr/SiO2 catalyst
 remarkably
 decreased
 within
 0.5
 h,
 and
then
 the
 decay
 of
 deactivation
 rate
 became
 gradual
 as
 shown
 in
Fig.
 1.
 The
 activity
 in
 the
 initial
 stage
 (within
 5
 min)
 was
 much
higher
 than
 that
 after
 the
 0.5
 h
 of
 the
 reaction.
 The
 fast
 reduc-
tion
 of
 Cr(VI)
 to
 Cr(III)
 over
 alumina-supported
 chromia
 under
 a
C3H8 stream
 has
 been
 detected
 by
 Weckhuysen
 et
 al.
 [41]
 using
in
 situ
 UV–vis
 diffuse
 reﬂectance
 spectroscopy
 through
 an
 opti-
cal
 ﬁber
 placed
 in
 the
 catalyst
 bed.
 In
 our
 cases,
 combined
 with
the
 Cr
 K-edge
 XAFS
 results,
 it
 can
 be
 thought
 that
 the
 oxidative
dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(VI)
 took
 place
 in
 the
 initial
 stage,
 while
the
 (simple)
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(III)
 mainly
 proceeded
 after
5
 min
 of
 the
 reaction.
 This
 result
 also
 clearly
 indicates
 that
 the
 rate
of
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(VI)
 was
 much
 larger
 than
that
 of
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(III).
 Weckhuysen
 and
 co-workers
conﬁrmed
 that
 the
 turnover
 frequency
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
C3H8 was
 higher
 for
 multinuclear
 Cr(III)
 than
 for
 isolated
 Cr(III)
sites
 [42].
 Cr
 K-edge
 XAFS
 spectra
 of
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 showed
that
 the
 Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedron
 were
 reduced
 to
 Cr(III)O6 octahe-
dron
 and
 then
 converted
 to
 an
 aggregated
 form
 of
 the
 Cr(III)O6
octahedron
 during
 the
 reaction.
 It
 appears
 that
 the
 aggregation
 of
Cr(III)O6 species
 can
 cause
 the
 decrease
 in
 the
 activity.
 After
 the
treatment
 with
 O2 or
 CO2,
 the
 Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedron
 were
 regener-
ated
 by
 the
 reoxidation
 of
 the
 Cr(III)O6 octahedron
 over
 Cr/SiO2 and
Cr/Al2O3,
 indicating
 that
 the
 reduction–oxidation
 cycle
 between
Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedron
 and
 Cr(III)O6 octahedron
 proceeded
 regard-
less
 of
 support.
 Although
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 activities
 of
Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 contrastive,
 the
 redox
 cycle
 of
 active
site
 (Cr(III)
 and
 Cr(VI))
 was
 involved
 in
 the
 reaction
 mechanism
regardless
 of
 support.
 We  also
 examined
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
activity
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 and
 Pt–Sn/Al2O3 (data
 not
 shown).
 In
 the
case
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2,
 no
 change
 in
 the
 activity
 was
 observed
 by
 the
addition
 of
 CO2. On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 activity
 of
 Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was
remarkably
 decreased
 by
 the
 addition
 of
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 CO2.
 In
these
 cases,
 the
 redox
 cycle
 of
 active
 site
 seems
 to
 be
 not
 involved
 in
the
 reaction
 mechanism.
 Therefore,
 these
 results
 strongly
 suggest
that
 the
 redox
 cycle
 of
 active
 site
 had
 an
 important
 role
 in
 the
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 C3H6 over
 Cr-based
 catalysts
 regardless
 of
 support.
However,
 the
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 activity
 was
 contrastive,
 although
the
 active
 sites
 of
 these
 catalysts
 were
 fundamentally
 same.
 The
promotion
 effect
 of
 CO2 was
 observed
 over
 Cr/SiO2,
 while
 negative
effect
 was
 clearly
 observed
 over
 Cr/Al2O3 and
 Pt–Sn/Al2O3,
 indicat-
ing
 that
 the
 support
 has
 also
 important.
 Kinetic
 analysis
 indicates
that
 CO2 and
 C3H8 competitively
 adsorbed
 on
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3
and
 that
 CO2 strongly
 adsorbed
 on
 Al2O3 support
 remarkably
 inhib-
ited
 the
 adsorption
 of
 C3H8 on
 the
 Cr/Al2O3.
 This
 inhibition
 of
 C3H8
adsorption
 may
 be
 resulted
 in
 negative
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 activ-
ity
 of
 Cr/Al2O3.
 On
 the
 basis
 of
 these
 results,
 we
 conclude
 that
the
 adsorption
 of
 C3H8 and
 CO2 on
 “support”
 has
 an
 effect
 on
 the
activity
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 adsorption
 on
 active
 sites.
4.3.
 Proposed
 reaction
 mechanism
 of
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
C3H8 over
 Cr-based
 catalysts
The
 proposed
 reaction
 mechanism
 of
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8
in
 the
 absence
 of
 CO2 is
 shown
 in
 Scheme
 1(A).
 In
 the
 initial
 stage
of
 the
 reaction,
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 proceeds
 through
 the
reduction
 of
 Cr(VI)
 to
 Cr(III).
 However,
 since
 the
 oxidation
 of
 Cr(III)
to
 Cr(VI)
 cannot
 proceed,
 after
 this
 stage,
 only
 dehydrogenation
156

proceeds
 over
 Cr(III).
 The
 aggregation
 of
 Cr(III)O6 species
 takes
place
 slowly,
 resulting
 in
 the
 decreasing
 in
 the
 activity.
On
 the
 other
 hand,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 in
the
 presence
 of
 carbon
 dioxide
 (Scheme
 1(B)),
 even
 after
 the
 ini-
tial
 stage
 of
 the
 reaction,
 a
 part
 of
 Cr(III)
 is
 oxidized
 to
 Cr(VI)
 with
CO2. As
 a
 result,
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 which
 reaction
 rate
is
 faster
 than
 that
 of
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(III)
 takes
 place
 in
addition
 to
 the
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Cr(III).
5.
 Conclusions
We
 found
 that
 the
 activity
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 with
CO2 over
 Cr/SiO2 was
 enhanced
 with
 increasing
 the
 partial
 pres-
sure
 of
 CO2,
 while
 the
 activity
 of
 Cr/Al2O3 was
 remarkably
 reduced
by
 the
 addition
 of
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 CO2.
 Cr
 K-edge
 XAFS
 spectra
and
 TPR
 proﬁles
 indicate
 that
 the
 redox
 cycle
 between
 Cr(III)O6 and
Cr(VI)O4 has
 an
 important
 role
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H6 over
both
 Cr/SiO2 and
 Cr/Al2O3 regardless
 of
 the
 catalyst
 support.
 CO2
could
 oxidize
 Cr(III)
 species
 to
 Cr(VI)
 species
 and
 provided
 the
 reac-
tion
 path
 of
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 over
 Cr(VI)
 species.
We
 conclude
 that
 the
 promotion
 effect
 of
 CO2 on
 the
 activity
 of
Cr/SiO2 is
 caused
 by
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 C3H8 over
Cr(VI)
 regenerated
 by
 the
 oxidation
 of
 Cr(III)
 to
 Cr(VI)
 with
 CO2.
 In
the
 case
 of
 Cr/Al2O3,
 although
 CO2 could
 oxidize
 Cr(III)
 to
 Cr(VI),
strongly
 adsorbed
 CO2 on
 Al2O3 inhibited
 the
 adsorption
 of
 C3H8,
resulting
 in
 the
 reducing
 the
 activity.
