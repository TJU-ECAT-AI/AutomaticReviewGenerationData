Abstract
M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Fe, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) have been tested for dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene with CO2. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), and diffuse
reﬂectance UV–vis spectroscopic measurements. Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in
the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing
Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced
to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction. Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a
treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric
Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed. The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation
decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2. It was conﬁrmed that reverse water-gas shift reaction took place over Cr-MCM-41 by a
separate experiment. The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for
by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1. Introduction
Styrene is one of the most important basic chemicals as
a monomer of synthetic polymers. It is commercially pro-
duced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene on the pro-
moted iron oxide catalysts in the presence of a large quantity
of steam at high temperatures of 600–700 ◦C, just below the
temperature where the thermal cracking becomes signiﬁcant.
Due to its high endothermic and volume increasing charac-
ter, a large amount of superheated steam is used to supply
heat, lower the partial pressure of the reactants to shift the
equilibrium to styrene, and avoid the formation of carbona-

ceous deposits to preserve the catalytic activity [1]. How-
ever, it has been pointed out that the preset commercial pro-
cesses waste a large amount of latent heat of steam conden-
sation at a liquid–gas separator following a reactor. Recently,
CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the
dehydrogenation, because it is always gaseous throughout
the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, reaction coupling
is an effective approach to improve the equilibrium conver-
sion in the dehydrogenation reactions [2]. Several investiga-
tions on reaction coupling were carried out in the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide
instead of steam [1,3–15], namely processes combined the
ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with reverse water-gas shift
reaction. It is estimated that the energy required for produc-
ing styrene is 6.3 × 108 cal/t in the coupling processes, only

42% of 1.5 × 109 cal/t in the current commercial process [3].
Therefore, such new processes that could be energy saving
and environmentally friendly have been attracting more and
more attention. Since Fe K based catalysts used for present
commercial dehydrogenation processes do not work effec-
tively in the presence of CO2, high performance catalysts
have been screened extensively and some new catalysts were
reported for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the pres-
ence of CO2 [3–15]. An Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by
co-precipitation [3,4], activated carbon-supported iron oxide
[5,6,10], and mixed oxide catalysts prepared from hydrotal-
cite precursors, i.e., Mg Al Fe oxide [7], Li Fe (Al) ox-
ide [8], and Mg Zn Al Fe oxide [9], have been proposed
as active iron catalysts, whereas activated carbon-supported
vanadium oxide [10], MgO-supported vanadium oxide [12],
Al2O3 supported V Sb mixed oxide [13,14], and Mg V Al
mixedoxidespreparedfromhydrotalciteprecursors[15]have
been tested as vanadium catalysts.
Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were in-
dustrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as
ethene, propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation
of the corresponding alkanes [16,17]. Carbon dioxide was
found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane [18–20],
propane [21–26] or isobutane [27] over supported chromium
oxide. The reduction–oxidation property and the appropriate
dispersion of chromium species on the support are impor-
tant in these catalytic reactions [28,29]. MCM-41, a typical
mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-
ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size
from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g−1)
[30], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst sup-
port. Studies of chromium species introduced into MCM-41
would thus be useful in developing Cr-containing catalysts
with desirable catalytic properties. There exist several stud-
ies on the synthesis and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41
[31–35].
In the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41 cat-
alysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT),
the selectivity to propene was higher than 90% with the
yield of 30% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhanced
propane conversion [36,37]. We have carefully studied on
the structures of Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrother-
mal synthesis by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, diffuse re-
ﬂectance UV–vis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS),
and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements. It was sug-
gested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-
MCM-41 and are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with oc-
tahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions
[38].
In the present paper, we report the catalytic behavior of Cr-
MCM-41 in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by carbon
dioxide. The catalytic activities for both dehydrogenation and
reverse water-gas shift reaction were tested and, moreover,
regeneration of the deactivated catalyst by oxygen or carbon
dioxide was investigated to elucidate the structure–activity
relationships for the Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.
2. Experiment
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Various metals (M = Cr, Ga, V, and Fe) were introduced
into MCM-41 by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Metal ni-
trate, sodium silicate, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide were used as the sources of chromium and silicon,
and the template, respectively. The molar ratio of the template
tothesiliconwaskeptat0.5inthesynthesisgel.Thesynthesis
gel was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then trans-
ferred to a Teﬂon bottle, which was placed in a stainless-steel
autoclave after the adjustment of the pH value of the mixed
gel to 10.5 with 4 M HCl. The hydrothermal synthesis was
carried out at 150 ◦C for 48 h, and then the resultant solid
was recovered by ﬁltration, washed thoroughly with deion-
ized water, and dried at 40 ◦C in vacuum for ca. 24 h. After
calcination at 550 ◦C for 6 h in a ﬂow of dry air, M-MCM-41
was obtained. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by chang-
ing the ratio of Cr to Si. As a control, Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalyst
was prepared by impregnation of nonporous Cab-O-Sil (M5,
Acros Organics) with Cr(III) nitrate.
2.2. Characterizations of catalysts
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spec-
troscopy was used for the determination of the metal content
in each sample synthesized above. The measurements were
performed with a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000, and the sam-
ple was dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3 before the
measurements.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous
properties of each sample. The measurements were carried
out on a Belsorp 18SP equipment (volumetric), and all the
samples were pretreated in vacuum at 200 ◦C for 12 h before
the measurements. The pore-size distribution was evaluated
fromtheadsorptionisothermbytheDollimoreandHeal(DH)
method [39].
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a SRA
M18XHF diffractometer (MAC Science Co., Ltd., Japan)
with Cu K radiation (40 kV, 300 mA). Small divergent and
scattering slits (0.05 mm) were selected to avoid a high back-
ground at low diffraction angles.
X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were per-
formed with synchrotron radiation at a beam line BL7C sta-
tion of Photon Factory, at the High Energy Accelerator Re-
search Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at 2.5 GeV
with about 350–380 mA of ring current. The data were
recorded in the X-ray ﬂuorescence mode at room temperature
using a Si(1 1 1) double crystal monochromator. Energy was
calibratedwithCuK-edgeabsorption(8981.0 eV),andtheen-
ergy step of measurement in the XANES region was 0.3 eV.
The absorption was normalized to 1.0 at an energy position of
30 eV higher than the absorption edge. Data reductions were
performed with the FACOM M1800 computer system of the
Data Processing Center of Kyoto University [40].

Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectroscopic measurements
were recorded on a JASCO UV/VIS/NIR (V-570) spec-
trophotometer. The spectra were collected in the range of
200–700 nm referenced to BaSO4. The sample was loaded in
an in situ cell and was treated in a pure N2 gas ﬂow at 200 ◦C
for dehydration before the measurement.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the cata-
lysts was carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor. One hun-
dred and ﬁfty milligrams of the catalyst after the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene at 550 ◦C for 1 h was used to deter-
mine the amount of carbon deposit on the catalyst. The tem-
perature was increased up to 800 ◦C at a rate of 2.5 ◦C min−1
in a mixture of O2 (5 ml min−1) and N2 (20 ml min−1).
2.3. Catalytic reaction
The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was conducted us-
ing a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. A quartz
glass tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm was used as a re-
actor. In the dehydrogenation reactions, typically 0.15 g of
catalyst, which had been pelletized and crushed to the par-
ticles 250–417 m in diameter, was loaded into the reactor
and treated in a gas ﬂow containing N2 (10 ml min−1) and O2
(10 ml min−1) at 550 ◦C for 1 h and then purged with N2. The
reaction was started by introducing a gas mixture of ethylben-
zene, N2 and either CO2 or Ar to the reactor. Ethylbenzene
(0.6 ml min−1; ca. 1.5 mmol h−1) was fed by bubbling a gas
mixture of CO2 or Ar (30 ml min−1) and N2 (10 ml min−1)
through liquid ethylbenzene held at 28.3 ◦C in a thermostat.
Ethylbenzene and the reaction products (styrene, toluene, and
benzene) were liqueﬁed with a cold trap of n-heptane and
acetone at 0 ◦C, and analyzed by an FID gas chromatograph
using a packed ID-BPX 5 column and cyclohexanone as an
internal standard. Analyses of gaseous products (CO, CO2,
N2, and H2) were performed by a TCD gas chromatograph
using a packed Molecular Sieve-5A column and Porapak Q.
All the lines and valves between the cold trap and the reac-
tor were heated to 150 ◦C to prevent the condensation of the
partial oxidation products. The other hydrocarbons and the
oxygenates were checked by a GC with FID using a packed
FFAP column, but were not detected. All data of the reactions
were collected after the reaction for 1 h and used for the cal-
culation of the reaction rates unless speciﬁcally mentioned,
since the activity of the catalyst gradually decreased during
the reaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties of various M-MCM-41
Physical properties of supported metal catalysts are shown
in Table 1. Metal contents determined by ICP analyses indi-
cated that all the metals in starting gel were not fully incor-
porated in silica structure. V, Ga, and Fe-MCM-41 showed
slightly larger surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter
than Cr-MCM-41. When the Cr loading was changed, pore
diameter was kept constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of
50, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased
with increasing Cr content. Cr/Cab-O-Sil showed a smaller
surface area compared with Cr-MCM-41 and the pore vol-
umes of both Cab-O-Sil and Cr/Cab-O-Sil were negligibly
small. While MCM-41 was white, as synthesized the color
of Cr-MCM-41 was pale green and changed to pale yellow or
yellow after the calcination at 550 ◦C for 6 h. XRD patterns at
low diffraction angles showed four diffraction lines at 2θ of
ca. 2.2◦, 3.6◦, 4.3◦, and 5.7◦indexed to (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0),
and (2 1 0) of the regularity of hexagonal array of mesopores
of MCM-41 for all the samples. The peak intensities for the
Cr-MCM-41 samples were not signiﬁcantly lowered as com-
pared with those for the purely silicious MCM-41, suggesting
that the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of meso-
pores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of
chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt.% (Si/Cr = 50). However,
as Si/Cr ratio decreased to 25 (3.4 wt.% of the Cr content),
these diffraction peaks signiﬁcantly decreased, indicating a
decrease in the structural regularity of the mesoporous struc-
ture at higher Cr contents. This was clearly seen also in the
drop in pore volume and surface area at the Si/Cr ratio of 25
(Table 1).

3.2. Activities of various M-MCM-41
Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), V
(40), Ga (46), and Fe (51) on MCM-41 prepared by direct
hydrothermal synthesis (number in the parenthesis shows the
Si/M ratio determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41
showed the highest activity, followed by V, Ga, and Fe sup-
ported on MCM-41 in the CO2 dehydrogenation of ethylben-
zene (Fig. 1). Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high
selectivity above 90% of styrene. The order of the activities of
these metals almost coincided with those observed over both
M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts
[22] in the propane dehydrogenation.
The selectivity to styrene is shown in Table 2 together with
those to toluene and benzene as by-products. Higher selectiv-
ity to styrene together with higher conversion of ethylbenzene
was observed over Cr-MCM-41 under the CO2 atmosphere
compared with Ar atmosphere. Under Ar atmosphere, ben-
zene formation was enhanced in particular, whereas styrene
formation was suppressed, suggesting that cracking of ethyl-
benzene was accelerated. Over Cr/Cab-O-Sil, styrene selec-
tivity was always high above 95% under both CO2 and Ar, but
ethylbenzene conversion was lower than over Cr-MCM-41.
3.3. Behaviors of Cr-MCM-41
Effect of the Cr loading on Cr-MCM-41 on the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene with CO2 is shown in Fig. 2. Ethyl-

benzene conversion increased with increasing Cr content up
to 1.7 wt.% (Si/Cr = 50), where the long-range regularity of
hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained af-
ter the introduction of chromium. Further increase in the Cr
content resulted in a gradual increase in the activity, which
is probably related to a change in the structure around Cr
species. It is considered that, at higher Cr contents, the dis-
persion of Cr species decreased by the aggregation (vide in-
fra) partly due to the decrease in the structural regularity of
the mesoporous structure. The selectivity to styrene was low
on MCM-41 without Cr and showed almost constant values
above 90% over all Cr-MCM-41 irrespective of the Cr con-
tent.
Inﬂuence of the reaction temperature on the ethylbenzene
dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) is shown in
Fig. 3. With increasing the temperature up to 600 ◦C, ethyl-
benzene conversion linearly increased, while the selectivity
to styrene gradually decreased. Further increase in the tem-
perature caused a clear decrease in the selectivity to styrene.
Benzene formation was signiﬁcantly enhanced above 600 ◦C,
suggesting that cracking of ethylbenzene was accelerated at
the high temperature. Effect of contact time on the rates of
both benzene and toluene formations in the ethylbenzene
dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) at 550 ◦C is
shown in Fig. 4. When the contact time was decreased to zero,
the rate of toluene formation linearly decreased and closed
to zero, whereas the rate of benzene formation still showed

a certain positive value even at zero contact time, i.e., in the
absence of the catalyst. With decreasing contact time, the
selectivity to benzene increased to reach 53.4% while that
to toluene decreased to 0% at zero contact time. No signif-
icant effect of the contact time on the selectivity to styrene
was observed; the high values above 90% were always held
except for the value of 46.6% at zero contact time. These re-
sults strongly suggest that the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst is indis-
pensable for the styrene formation and, moreover, benzene
is produced by thermal cracking reaction, whereas toluene
forms by catalytic cracking over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50).
The thermal cracking to benzene was supported by the result
that the formation of benzene was more signiﬁcantly acceler-
ated than that of toluene with increasing reaction temperature
(Fig. 3). Sugino et al. [6] reported that cracking of ethylben-
zene to benzene and toluene occurred with a low selectivity of

0.5–1.0% in the CO2 dehydrogenation over an active carbon-
supported iron catalyst (Fe 17 wt.%) at 500–700 ◦C. How-
ever, the amounts of these products were not large enough to
account for the decrease in the selectivity to styrene. These
results indicate that the decrease in the selectivity to styrene
could be accounted for by thermal decomposition of ethyl-
benzene and styrene to coke over the Fe catalyst. Over the
Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) catalyst in the present work, on the
other hand, the formations of both benzene and toluene were
more evident, whereas coke formation was negligibly small,
compared with the reaction on the Fe catalyst. Benzene and
toluene formed with the selectivity above 5 and 1%, respec-
tively, suggesting that dehydrogenation to styrene was ac-
companied by thermal and catalytic cracking of ethylben-
zene or reaction intermediates. It is likely that a part of ben-
zene forms directly from ethylbenzene by thermal cracking,
whereas toluene mainly forms via catalytic C C bond ﬁssion
from ethylbenzene or styrene over the catalyst.
3.4. Role of reverse water-gas shift reaction
Inﬂuence of partial pressure of CO2 on the dehydrogena-
tion of ethylbenzene over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) is shown
in Figs. 5 and 6. As seen in Fig. 5, both conversion of ethyl-
benzene and selectivity to styrene increased whereas selectiv-
ity to both benzene and toluene decreased by co-feeding CO2
even at 2 kPa in the ethylbenzene/N2 system. Further increase
in the CO2 pressure caused a slow increase in the ethylben-
zene conversion, while the selectivities to styrene, benzene,
and toluene showed no signiﬁcant change. Rate of styrene
formation revealed almost similar behavior to the ethylben-
zene conversion, i.e., a quick increase by co-feeding CO2 at
2 kPa followed by a gradual increase with further increase in
the CO2 pressure (Fig. 6). In the absence of CO2, the produc-
tion rate of H2 and that of styrene coincided well with each
other, suggesting that simple dehydrogenation of ethylben-

took place over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50). By co-feeding
CO2, the rate of H2 production decreased whereas the rate of
CO production increased, suggesting that reverse water-gas
shift reaction (2) simultaneously took place over the catalyst.
Actually, the
CO2 + H2 →CO + H2O

occurrence of the shift reaction (2) was conﬁrmed by feeding
a mixed gas of CO2 and H2 over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50)
(Table 3). The amount of H2 consumed well coincided with
that of CO formed during the reaction, indicating that the
shift reaction (2) occurred over Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50).

zwiak et al. [41] reported that, when Cr(VI)O3 was sup-
ported on SiO2 by an incipient-wetness method, a thermally
stable chromate-like species Cr(VI)O42−formed on the sur-
face of the sample with the low Cr loading less than 3.0 wt.%
after the calcination at 500 ◦C. These molecularly dispersed
chromate species form in high population on silica surface
and are anchored to silica substrate in the form of chromate
esters (Fig. 7). The increase in Cr content leads gradually
to di- or polychromate species, amorphous and ﬁnally crys-
talline -chromia phases. These results well coincide with
those observed for the surface structure of chromium oxides
on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts by the authors [37,38]. We have pre-

pared Cr-MCM-41 starting from Cr(III) nitrate and observed
the formation of Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra after the calcination at
550 ◦C. The isolated chromate species may lose two termi-
nally bonded oxygen atoms by the recombination leading to
the evolution of oxygen molecule as well as the formation of
Cr(II)O22−species (Fig. 7, Scheme I) [41]. In the presence of
water, coordination of an extra OH group takes place, result-
ing in the Cr(II) oxidation to Cr(III) species (Fig. 7, Scheme
II). On the CrOx/silica with low Cr loading, reversible inter-
conversions Cr(VI) ↔Cr(III) and Cr(VI) ↔Cr(II) seem to
occur when hydrogen or carbon monoxide are used as the
reducing agent [41].
It is frequently reported that water-gas shift reaction pro-
ceeds via a mechanism of reduction–oxidation of active metal
species as seen in the behavior of CeO2 in ceria-supported
Pt, Pd, and Rh catalysts [42] and Cu- and Ni-loaded cerium
oxide catalysts [43]. In these studies, a co-operative redox
reaction mechanism, involving oxidation of CO adsorbed on
the metal cluster by oxygen supplied to the metal interface
by ceria, followed by H2O capping the oxygen vacancy on
ceria, well explained the results obtained by the kinetic stud-
ies. The Cr(II) and Cr(III) oxo species are often regarded as
the catalytic sites on silica surface in many reactions [44–46].
Also in the present work, it is considered that reverse water-
gas shift reaction may proceed through a coupling of Cr(III)
reduction to Cr(II) by H2 (3) and, inversely, Cr(II) oxidation
to Cr(III) by CO2 (4) over Cr-MCM-41:
Cr(III) O−+ H2 →Cr(II) + H2O
(3)
Cr(II) + CO2 →Cr(III) O−+ CO
(4)
3.5. Direct contribution of CO2
When this catalyst was applied in the system of
ethylbenzene CO2, H2 produced by the dehydrogenation (1)
could be consumed by reverse water-gas shift reaction (2) and

the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation (1)
would shift toward styrene formation, resulting in an increase
in the rate of styrene formation. Assuming that CO forms by
reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), the rate of CO formation
would be equal to a decrease in the rate of H2 formation. The
decrease in the rate of H2 formation was calculated based on
the rate obtained by simple dehydrogenation in the absence
of CO2 (Fig. 6A). As a result, the value was always ca. 45%
of the rate of CO formation regardless of the CO2 pressure
up to 52 kPa. This suggests that the remaining part of CO (ca.
55%) evolved from reactions other than the reverse water-gas
shift reaction. The sum of an increase in the rate of styrene
formation (Fig. 6B) and a decrease in the rate of H2 formation
(Fig. 6A) is plotted against the partial pressure of CO2. The
sum value of A and B almost coincided with the rate of CO
formation throughout all partial pressure of CO2, indicating
that the remaining part of CO mainly evolved accompanied
by styrene formation. Moreover, judging from the logarith-
mic plot, the rate of ethylbenzene consumption showed a
ﬁrst order dependency on the partial pressure of CO2, sug-
gesting that CO2 directly contributed to the dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene. A plausible mechanism of such direct con-
tribution of CO2 is that CO2 works as the oxidizing agent of
ethylbenzene to styrene (5):
-CH2CH3 + CO2 →-CH CH2 + CO + H2O
(5)
As shown in the results of CO2 dehydrogenation of ethylben-
zene over Cr-MCM-41 with various Cr loadings at 550 ◦C
(Fig. 2), the selectivity to styrene was always higher than
90% and the conversion of ethylbenzene increased almost
linearly with an increase in the Cr loading. Even though
the BET surface area and pore volume greatly decreased as
the Cr loading increased to 3.4 wt.% (Si/Cr = 25) (Table 1),
the conversion of ethylbenzene and the yield of styrene in-
creased with increasing Cr loading, indicating such change
in the porous structure did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
catalytic behavior. It has been clearly seen that the sim-
ple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene took place over Cr-
MCM-41 even in the absence of CO2 (Fig. 5). The rate
of styrene formation remarkably increased together with
that of CO formation with increasing partial pressure of
CO2. According to thermodynamic equilibrium of dehy-
drogenation of ethylbenzene (1) at 550 ◦C in the gas mix-
ture of ethylbenzene Ar at the molar ratio of 1:2.5 and at
WHSV = 0.2 h−1, ethylbenzene conversion was calculated as
44.7% [47], almost coinciding with the value obtained in
Fig. 5. According to the thermodynamic considerations [10],
ethylbenzene conversion can be improved by coupling the
reaction with reverse water-gas shift reaction (2). Moreover,
the direct contribution of CO2 (5) possibly shifts the dehy-
drogenation equilibrium towards products under CO2 atmo-
sphere. The results obtained in the present work, i.e., the
increases in both ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield
in the presence of CO2, are well explained by these conside-
rations.

3.6. Deactivation and regeneration of Cr-MCM-41
Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) showed the ethylbenzene con-
version of 64.1% with the styrene yield of 59.1% with a
gas mixture of N2 CO2-ethylbenzene at the molar ratio of
27/80/1.5 and at GHSV = 6800 ml gcat−1 h−1 at the reaction
time of 0.5 h (Fig. 8). The activity gradually decreased during
the reaction over Cr-MCM-41, indicating the occurrence of
catalyst deactivation. After the reaction for 3 h, the gas-ﬂow
of the mixture of ethylbenzene and CO2 was replaced by the
mixed gas-ﬂow of O2/N2 at the ratio of 10/10 ml min−1. After
the treatment with O2 for 1 h, the reaction was restarted by
replacing the gas ﬂow with the mixture of ethylbenzene and
CO2. The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was recovered; both ethyl-
benzene conversion and styrene yield returned to the original
values of 63.3 and 58.3%, respectively, after the treatment
with O2 (Fig. 8). When the catalyst was again put in the re-
action conditions after the O2 treatment, the conversion of
ethylbenzene decreased in an almost similar way to the ﬁrst
reaction step.
In the XRD patterns for Cr-MCM-41 after the reactions,
the peak intensities at the low diffraction angles signiﬁcantly
decreasedunderAratmosphereascomparedwiththoseunder
CO2 atmosphere, suggesting that the long-range regularity of
hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was weakened
after the reaction in Ar. Both surface area and pore volume
were also signiﬁcantly decreased under Ar atmosphere, but
were stable under CO2 atmosphere. These suggest that lattice
oxygen in Cr-MCM-41 was consumed during the dehydro-
genation under Ar atmosphere, resulting in the collapse or the
weakening of the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays.
On the other hand, the defect formed by the lattice oxygen
uptake can be reﬁlled by oxygen from gas phase CO2, re-
sulting in no substantial change in the structure under CO2
atmosphere. XRD measurements showed no diffraction line
assigned to any chromium species during all processes, i.e.,
the dehydrogenation reaction and the O2 treatment.

In the Cr K-edge XANES spectra of Cr-MCM-41, the
change in the local symmetry around the chromium center
from CrO4 tetrahedral coordination to CrO6 octahedral co-
ordination was observed during the ethylbenzene dehydro-
genation. Moreover, the results of Fourier transforms of k3-
weighted Cr K-edge EXAFS indicated that CrO4 tetrahedra
consists of two Cr O bonds and two Cr O bonds before
the reaction, whereas both CrO6 octahedra and Cr O Cr
through corner-shared CrO6 octahedra appeared to form
small Cr(III)Ox clusters after the dehydrogenation reaction.
After the treatment with O2, both XANES and EXAFS spec-
tra showed that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated
by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra. These results
obtained by both XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopic
measurements were almost similar to those observed in the
dehydrogenation of propane [37,38].
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra of Cr-MCM-41
(Si/Cr = 50) with the Si/Cr ratio of 50 during the reaction are
shown in Fig. 9. UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be
assigned to O Cr(VI) charge transfer of chromates species
[37,38,48],weremainlyobservedtogetherwithaweakshoul-
der around 450 nm assigned to Cr(VI) polychromate for a
fresh sample of Cr-MCM-41 (Fig. 9a). The bands at ca. 450
and 600 nm appeared after the dehydrogenation reaction with
CO2 for 1 h could be assigned to octahedral Cr(III) in Cr2O3
or CrOx clusters, whereas the Cr(VI) species observed at 280
and 370 nm could be in tetrahedral coordination (Fig. 9b).
No diffraction line of Cr2O3 was observed in XRD patterns
of Cr-MCM-41 after the reaction, suggesting that Cr species
are still well dispersed on Cr-MCM-41. It is concluded that
tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41
before the reaction (Fig. 9a) and reduced to octahedrally co-
ordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction (Fig. 9b). It is also
noteworthy that the latter species appeared as polychromates
on Cr-MCM-41, the sizes of which are too small to be ob-
served in XRD. Such change in both the coordination struc-
ture and valence state of chromium caused the deactivation of
Cr-MCM-41. After the CO2 treatment of the deactivated Cr-
MCM-41 at 650 ◦C (Fig. 9c), the bands at 280 and 370 nm
assigned to O Cr(VI) charge transfer of tetrahedral CrO4
were regenerated, whereas those at ca. 450 and 600 nm as-
signed to octahedral Cr(III) in Cr2O3 or CrOx clusters disap-
peared even though a peak around 450 nm assigned to Cr(VI)
polychromate was still observed as a shoulder. After the O2
treatment at 550 ◦C, the latter shoulder was almost weakened
and the original spectra observed for the fresh sample were
regenerated, indicating that the O2 treatment was effective in
recovering the original coordination structure of the active
chromium species (Fig. 9d).
3.7. Coke formation on Cr-MCM-41-DHT
Table 4 shows the coke amounts estimated by TPO mea-
surement of the catalysts after the dehydrogenation reaction
of ethylbenzene under CO2 and Ar atmosphere at 550 ◦C
for 1 h. On Cr-MCM-41 and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts (both
Si/Cr = 50), 0.60 and 0.31 wt.% of coke was formed under
CO2 atmosphere, respectively, while 0.38 and 0.13 wt.% of
coke under Ar atmosphere, respectively; larger amounts of
coke deposited on both catalysts under CO2 atmosphere than
under Ar atmosphere. Coke can be formed more intensively
on the catalyst surface from styrene than from ethylbenzene,
and therefore the enhanced formation of styrene over Cr-
MCM-41 reasonably resulted in a larger amount of coke
formation. It was clearly observed that CO was produced
from CO2 during the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation over Cr-
MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) (Fig. 6). It must be noticed that CO2
can be converted to CO via reverse water-gas shift reaction by
consuming H2 or via Boudouard reaction by consuming coke
on the catalyst surface. The behavior of Cr-MCM-41 catalyst
is similar to that of V2O5/MgO [12], on which CO2 could
not suppress the coke formation. It is likely that coke formed
from styrene as a main product, the formation of which in
high concentration possibly resulted in enhanced coke for-
mation. The activity was quickly regenerated on Cr-MCM-
41 even after the oxidation treatment for a short time, i.e.,
1 h, during which, however, coke elimination was not com-
pleted. Such non-completed coke elimination was conﬁrmed
by GC analyses during the oxidation treatment, indicating

that the catalyst deactivation was not caused by the coke
formation.
It seems that the tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) plays
an important role in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
with CO2. However, the reaction proceeded under CO2 at-
mosphere even after the deactivation, where Cr(VI) tetrahe-
dra almost disappeared and moreover its quick regeneration
was not easy. It is most likely that molecularly dispersed
chromium species possess an important role in the catalysis
for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 probably by
the redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) as suggested in
the water-gas shift reaction.
4. Conclusion
Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal
synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide, resulting in the produc-
tion of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selec-
tivity above 90%. It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral
coordination formed as an active monochromate species and
reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active
polychromate species during the reaction. The deactivated
catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxy-
gen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to
the Cr(VI) species was observed. Not only gaseous oxygen
but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra
from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efﬁciency
of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen. However the
reaction still proceeded under CO2 atmosphere even after the
deactivation, where Cr(VI) tetrahedra almost disappeared.
Moreover, reverse water-gas shift reaction was catalyzed over
Cr-MCM-41, and the catalytic cycle is probably composed of
the reduction–oxidation between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species.
Hydrogen formed by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
was consumed by reverse water-gas shift reaction, resulting
intheaccelerationofethylbenzenedehydrogenation.Therate
of CO formation was well accounted for by two origins, i.e.,
one from the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the other
from the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by
CO2. It is suggested that ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to
styrene directly with CO2 and also coupled by reverse water-
gas shift reaction and that both reactions were catalyzed by
the reduction–oxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II).
