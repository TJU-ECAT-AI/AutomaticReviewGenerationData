1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

1.该文件没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较，也没有讨论支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载和支撑性质的关系。该文件主要关注CO2对SiO2支撑Cr2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的促进作用。Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下的活性远低于CO2不存在时的活性。Cr2O3/AC的活性与CO2的存在无关。另一方面，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下的活性令人惊讶地比CO2不存在时高40%。Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂对CO和H2的选择性在C3H6产量变化时没有改变。在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中，Cr2O3含量增加时，CO2存在下C3H6产量与CO2不存在下C3H6产量的比值降低。Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界可能在CO2的促进作用中起重要作用。CO2的添加可以抑制催化剂的失活。CO2可以氧化催化剂表面的一部分Cr2O3。Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的Cr2O3表面在没有CO2的情况下进行脱氢时可以被还原，而在CO2存在下进行反应时，Cr2O3表面可能保持部分氧化。
