1.The document does not provide a comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2. The surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

1.文件没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的比较，也没有讨论负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变与负载量和支持物性质的关系。文件主要关注CO2对SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的促进作用。Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下的活性远低于CO2不存在时的活性。Cr2O3/AC的活性与CO2的存在无关。另一方面，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下的活性令人惊讶地比CO2不存在时高40%。在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中，Cr2O3含量增加时，C3H6产量在CO2存在下的反应与CO2不存在时的反应的比率降低。这表明Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界可能在CO2的促进作用中起重要作用。Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的Cr2O3表面在CO2不存在的情况下，可以在C3H8脱氢过程中被还原，而在CO2存在的情况下，Cr2O3表面可能保持部分氧化。
