[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[4] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

1.The study prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts with Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range by direct hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high specific surface area. These catalysts were tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants. The chromium species found were surface chromates, accompanied by Brnsted acid centers. All catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation, with propene yields as high as 40% achieved. The role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and its tentative correlation with propene selectivity were rationalized.

1.该研究通过直接水热合成制备了Cr/SiO2催化剂，Cr负载量在0.25-2.0 wt%范围内，以实现高比表面积。这些催化剂在使用CO2或CO2+O2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中进行了测试。发现的铬物种是表面铬酸盐，伴有Brnsted酸中心。所有催化剂都表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，实现了高达40%的丙烯产率。不同氧化剂在定义铬氧化态及其与丙烯选择性的初步相关性方面的作用得到了合理化。
