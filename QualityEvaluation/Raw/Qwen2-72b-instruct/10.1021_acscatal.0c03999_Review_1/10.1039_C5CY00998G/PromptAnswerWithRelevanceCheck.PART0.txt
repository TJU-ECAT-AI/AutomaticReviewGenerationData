Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
[2] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[3] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[5] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

1.该研究通过直接水热合成制备了Cr/SiO2催化剂，Cr负载量在0.25-2.0 wt%范围内，以实现高比表面积。这些催化剂在使用CO2或CO2+O2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中进行了测试。随着Cr含量的增加，介孔的范围和规则性显著降低，但这并未影响高Cr负载量催化剂的催化性能。所有催化剂仅含有表面铬酸盐和Brnsted酸中心，并且即使在测试900分钟后，它们也对不可逆失活保持稳定，实现了高达40%的丙烯产率。不同的氧化剂在定义铬氧化态以及其与丙烯选择性之间的初步相关性方面的作用得到了合理化。
