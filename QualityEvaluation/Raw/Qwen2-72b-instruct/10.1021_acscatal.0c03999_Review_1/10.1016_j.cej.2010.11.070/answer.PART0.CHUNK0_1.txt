[1] "Catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."
[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
[4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[5] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
[6] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

1.The study compares the catalytic performance of Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The catalysts with chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only contain chromate species, which exhibit high catalytic activity with a yield of propene up to 69%. The MVS technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings. The catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% results in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the investigated process.

1.该研究比较了通过金属蒸汽合成(MVS)制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。铬负载量高达6.0 wt%的催化剂仅含有铬酸盐物种,表现出高达69%的丙烯产率。MVS技术允许在Cr原子活性和高(6.0 wt%)铬负载量下在二氧化硅表面分散铬物种方面优化系统。催化活性归因于各种核性铬酸盐物种在二氧化硅表面的接枝。铬负载量超过6.0 wt%会导致- Cr2O3颗粒的出现,这些颗粒在研究过程中不活跃。
