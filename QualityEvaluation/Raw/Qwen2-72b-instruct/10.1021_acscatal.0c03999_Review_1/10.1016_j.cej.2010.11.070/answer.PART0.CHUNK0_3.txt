[1] "Catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."

[5] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
[6] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

1.The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a mild oxidant. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading of the active metal, and the properties of the support material. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is crucial for optimizing activity and selectivity. At chromium loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species are present on the catalyst surface, which results in high catalytic activity and selectivity. However, increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% leads to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the process. The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings. The catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface.

1.该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在使用CO2作为温和氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的催化性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、活性金属的负载量以及支撑材料的性质。在支撑Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种随负载量和支撑材料性质的演变对于优化活性和选择性至关重要。在铬负载量高达6.0 wt%时，催化剂表面仅存在铬酸盐物种，这导致了高催化活性和选择性。然而，将铬负载量提高到6.0 wt%以上会导致- Cr2O3颗粒的形成，这些颗粒在该过程中不活跃。使用金属蒸汽合成(MVS)技术允许在每Cr原子的活性方面优化系统，并在高铬负载量下在二氧化硅表面分散铬物种。催化活性归因于在二氧化硅表面接枝的具有各种核性的铬酸盐物种的存在。
