          [1] "Catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
          [2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."
          [3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
          [4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
          [5] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
          [6] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."
          [7] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

          The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process. The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.

          该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应(CO2-ODHP)中的催化性能，特别关注了负载和载体性质变化时，支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。通过金属蒸汽合成(MVS)制备的催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出高活性和选择性。丙烯的选择性超过80%，所有铬负载高于0.5 wt%的催化剂的丙烯产量约为40%或更高。MVS技术使系统在每Cr原子的活性方面得以优化，并使铬物种在高达6.0 wt%的高铬负载下分散在二氧化硅表面。催化活性归因于各种核性铬酸盐物种在二氧化硅表面的接枝。将铬负载增加到6.0 wt%以上不会导致单-或聚-铬酸盐物种的进一步增加，而是在催化剂表面出现-Cr2O3颗粒，这些颗粒在该过程中不活跃。表面铬酸盐物种的形成伴随着Brnsted酸位点的出现，这些位点负责焦炭的产生，并且对于更高的Cr含量相对更丰富。
