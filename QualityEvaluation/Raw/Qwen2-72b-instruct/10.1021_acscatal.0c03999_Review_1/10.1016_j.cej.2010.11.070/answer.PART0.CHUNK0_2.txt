[1] "Catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."
[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
[4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[5] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."
[6] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

1.The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading of the metal, and the properties of the support. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties shows that up to 6.0 wt% chromium loading, only chromate species are present on the catalyst surface, which results in high catalytic activity and selectivity. Beyond 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the -Cr2O3 particles appear, which are not active in the process. The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings. The formation of surface chromate species is accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, which are responsible for coke production and are more abundant for higher Cr contents.

1.该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中在二氧化碳存在下的催化性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、金属的负载量以及载体的性质。负载量和载体性质对负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变表明，直到6.0 wt%的铬负载量，催化剂表面仅存在铬酸盐物种，这导致了高催化活性和选择性。超过6.0 wt%的铬负载量，-Cr2O3颗粒出现，它们在该过程中不活跃。使用金属蒸汽合成(MVS)技术允许在Cr原子的活性方面优化系统，并在高铬负载量下在二氧化硅表面分散铬物种。表面铬酸盐物种的形成伴随着Brnsted酸位点的出现，这些位点负责焦炭的产生，并且对于更高的Cr含量相对更丰富。
