1.The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (CO2-ODHP), with a focus on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) showed high activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction. The selectivity to propylene was over 80%, and the yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for all catalysts with chromium loading above 0.5 wt%. The MVS technique enabled the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and facilitated the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings of 6.0 wt%. The catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% did not lead to further increases in mono- or poly-chromate species but resulted in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface, which were not active in the process.

1.该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应(CO2-ODHP)中的催化性能，特别关注了负载和载体性质变化时，支撑Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。通过金属蒸汽合成(MVS)制备的催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出高活性和选择性。丙烯的选择性超过80%，所有铬负载高于0.5 wt%的催化剂的丙烯产量约为40%或更高。MVS技术使系统在每Cr原子的活性方面得以优化，并使铬物种在高达6.0 wt%的高铬负载下分散在二氧化硅表面。催化活性归因于各种核性铬酸盐物种在二氧化硅表面的接枝。将铬负载增加到6.0 wt%以上不会导致单-或聚-铬酸盐物种的进一步增加，而是在催化剂表面出现-Cr2O3颗粒，这些颗粒在该过程中不活跃。

1.The study compares the catalytic performance of Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis (MVS) in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The catalysts with chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only contain chromate species, which exhibit high catalytic activity with a yield of propene up to 69%. The MVS technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings. The catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface.

1.The study compares the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading of the metal, and the properties of the support. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties shows that up to 6.0 wt% chromium loading, only chromate species are present on the catalyst surface, which results in high catalytic activity and selectivity. Beyond 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the -Cr2O3 particles appear, which are not active in the process. The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings.

1.该研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中在二氧化碳存在下的催化性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、金属的负载量以及载体的性质。负载量和载体性质对负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变表明，直到6.0 wt%的铬负载量，催化剂表面仅存在铬酸盐物种，这导致了高催化活性和选择性。超过6.0 wt%的铬负载量，-Cr2O3颗粒出现，它们在该过程中不活跃。使用金属蒸汽合成(MVS)技术允许在Cr原子的活性方面优化系统，并在高铬负载量下在二氧化硅表面分散铬物种。表面铬酸盐物种的形成伴随着Brnsted酸位点的出现，这些位点负责焦炭的产生，并且对于更高的Cr含量相对更丰富。

The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading of the active metal, and the properties of the support material. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is crucial for optimizing activity and selectivity. At chromium loadings up to 6.0 wt%, only chromate species are present on the catalyst surface, which results in high catalytic activity and selectivity. However, increasing the chromium loading beyond 6.0 wt% leads to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the process.
