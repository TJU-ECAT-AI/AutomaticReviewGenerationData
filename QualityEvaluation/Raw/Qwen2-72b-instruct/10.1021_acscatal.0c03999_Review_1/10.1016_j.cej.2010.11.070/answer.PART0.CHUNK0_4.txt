1.The study compares the catalytic performance of Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by metal vapour synthesis in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The catalysts with chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only have chromate species on their surface, while higher loadings result in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles. The catalyst with 6.0 wt% chromium loading demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with a yield of propene of 69%. The use of metal vapor synthesis technique allows for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high chromium loadings. The catalytic activity is related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface. Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% does not result in further increase of mono- or poly- chromate species but in the appearance of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the process.

1.该研究比较了通过金属蒸汽合成制备的Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。铬负载量高达6.0 wt%的催化剂表面仅存在铬酸盐物种，而更高负载量则导致-Cr2O3颗粒的出现。6.0 wt%铬负载量的催化剂表现出最高的催化活性，丙烯产率为69%。使用金属蒸汽合成技术可以优化系统在每Cr原子活性方面的性能，并使铬物种在高铬负载量下在二氧化硅表面高度分散。催化活性与各种核性铬酸盐物种在二氧化硅表面的接枝有关。铬负载量超过6.0 wt%不会导致单-或聚-铬酸盐物种的进一步增加，而是导致-Cr2O3颗粒在催化剂表面的出现，这些颗粒在该过程中不活跃。
