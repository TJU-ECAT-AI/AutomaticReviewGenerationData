Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that CO2 has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能，也没有详细描述负载和载体性质变化时，支撑的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变。然而，它确实提到CO2在促进丙烷脱氢反应中，对硅胶支撑的Cr2O3催化剂有促进作用，提高了丙烯的产量，抑制了催化剂的失活。部分氧化的Cr2O3在SiO2上的支撑对丙烷脱氢反应是活性的。在CO2的存在下，Cr2O3/SiO2的表面可能在反应中保持部分氧化。
