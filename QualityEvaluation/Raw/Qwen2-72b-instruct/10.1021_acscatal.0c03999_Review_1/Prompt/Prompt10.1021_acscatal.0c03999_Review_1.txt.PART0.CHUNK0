3. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Carbon Dioxide
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To To verify the feasibility of CO2ODHP, early screening tests were conducted on metal oxides that are active for DHP and O2ODHP, including transition metal oxides (Fe2O3 and Cr2O3) and main-group metal oxides (Ga2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2). (51,52) Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none. For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2). Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.).

Of note, deactivation is rapid on individual metal oxides, especially on Ga2O3 (75% from 0.17 to 0.75 h on stream) and Cr2O3 (78% within the same time range). (52) Carbon deposition and reduction in active sites might be responsible for such rapid deactivation, the dominance of which depends on the nature of metal oxide, roles of CO2, and reaction mechanisms. Hence, unraveling the deactivation mechanisms and seeking solutions for catalyst regeneration are another area that has been extensively studied. In addition, there are other challenges to be addressed, such as the competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H6 and elusive reaction mechanisms.
On the basis of the achievements in these areas, this section mainly covers the progress in (i) developing fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and activity with representative redox-active and nonredox metal oxide catalysts (i.e., loading-dependent evolution of active sites during reaction, support/promoter nature), (ii) catalyst deactivation and regeneration, and (iii) the roles of CO2 in affecting reaction paths, modifying catalyst surfaces, and coke removal.
3.1. Redox-Type Catalysts
3.1.1. Chromium (Cr)-Based Catalysts
3.1.1.1. Identification of Active Cr Sites and Redox Cycles
Cr Content-Dependent Evolution of Cr Sites For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. (5)Table 3 summarizes the surface density of commonly used redox-active metal oxides on supports. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+  dispersed Cr6+ oxide  microcrystalline Cr3+  crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. (76) α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, yet inactive for catalysis because of its high resistance to reduction and oxidation. (54) Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity. (54) An analogous monolayer threshold is also known for supported VOx catalysts for the O2ODHP reaction. (77) Table 3.

Nb 4.8 5.8 5.8   0.3 Reproduced with the permission from ref (78). Copyright 1996 Elsevier B.V The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). (55) (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both (Table 2). Diffuse reflectance UVvis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %). The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active.
Redox Cycle As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP. (22) However, the redox cycles are not unambiguously established. There are two major types of redox cycles that have been proposed, namely, Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+  Cr2+. The former redox cycle is proposed on MCM-41- (Figure 5), TUD-1-, (11) and Al2O3-supported Cr catalysts, (8082) while the latter is known on Ni-promoted (56) (Figure 5) and unpromoted CrOx/SiO2. (57) On the basis of these supported Cr catalysts, one can postulate a potential correlation of the nature of the support with Cr reducibility, as well as with Cr loading-dependent dispersion. Major progress has been made in unveiling the later correlation. However, the support effect has been scarcely studied.
On Cr-MCM-41 with high Cr dispersion, CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by reoxidizing the reduced Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4, though the oxidation efficiency is not comparable to O2 (Figure 5). (58) In contrast, Michorczyk et al. reported a redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr2+ on CrOx/SiO2 below a monolayer Cr coverage (0.34 Cr nm2, see Table 3). (57) As shown in Table 2, C3H8 conversion increases with the rise of reaction temperatures, and C3H6 selectivity is higher than 94%. Meanwhile, CO2 conversion is evident, yet the values are not comparable to those of C3H8 conversion. In situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra reveal that the reoxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ (eq 3-1) hardly occurs during regeneration, even if the catalyst is exposed to an excess of CO2. Hence, the redox-property scenario in O2ODHP (i.e., Cr6+  Cr3+/Cr2+) is unlikely replicated in CO2ODHP (eq 3-2). Given their capability to catalyze both DHP and RWGS reactions, (83) CrOx might take part in the reaction through the redox cycle of Cr3+  Cr2+ with H2, formed via RWGS (eq 3-3), as the reducing agent, followed by reoxidation of Cr2+ to Cr3+ by CO2 (eq 3-4). Of note, such a case might only happen below a monolayer coverage, because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, giving rise to the further reduction of Cr3+  Cr2+.
(3-1) (3-2) (3-3) (3-4) Comprehensive reaction paths have been proposed by incorporating both redox and nonredox sites. (59) As illustrated in Figure 5, the oxidized CrOx and reduced CrOx1 sites are proposed as the major active sites responsible for C3H8 dehydrogenation. Generally, the C3H6 yield increases with the concentration of Cr6+ species, indicative of their crucial role as precursors to form active species. At the initial stage, the reduction of Cr6+ species leads to the generation of Cr2+/Cr3+ species (i.e., CrOx1), which triggers the C3H6 formation through a nonoxidative pathway. Also, the nonredox Cr3+ sites (CrOy), formed through Cr3+ oxide agglomeration, may contribute to the nonoxidative pathway, though insignificantly. Alternatively, the presence of CO2 contributes to the completion of the redox cycle, namely, CrOx  CrOx1, enabling C3H6 formation through the oxidative pathway. The presence of a redox cycle can boost the H2 consumption via RWGS and therefore promote C3H6 formation by shifting the equilibrium of the ODHP to the product side.
3.1.1.2. Effects of Support
The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metalsupport interaction, (ii) acidbase properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.
Metal Oxides In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2). (51) Relatively weak metalsupport interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. (60) In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield. (74,75) Although high CO2 conversion can be achieved on the ZrO2-supported counterpart, its strong basicity leads to lower C3H6 selectivity but higher selectivity toward CO and CH4. (51,60,61) Competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H8 occurs on supports with amphoteric property, such as γ-Al2O3, leading to decreased catalytic performance (Table 2), especially at higher CO2 partial pressures. (62,82) MCM-41-supported Cr catalysts exhibit comparable activity to the SiO2-supported counterpart, which is associated with its ordered mesoporous structure with large surface area and pore volume. (51) Such prominence is also evident on SBA-15 and SBA-1 (Table 2). (54) The ordered mesoporous structure and large surface area not only helps to improve Cr surface density but also the dispersion of the Cr6+ species, thereby benefiting C3H6 formation.
Because of the high activity of Ga2O3 in CO2ODHP (discussed in section 3.2.1), it has been applied as support for Cr catalysts with expectation of synergistic effect. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr2O3/β-Ga2O3 with various loadings for CO2ODHP. (63) The CO2-promoting effect is observed on Cr6.8/β-Ga2O3 at temperatures higher than 570 C (Table 2). Adding Cr neutralizes the acid sites on β-Ga2O3, leading to coking resistance through a CO2-induced reverse Boudouard reaction.
Ordered, Mesoporous Silica (MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1) As mentioned above, the redox properties and appropriate dispersion of Cr species on the surface are important for CO2ODHP. To achieve high activity and selectivity, introducing mesoporous silica as a support offers avenues to tune these factors. The materials that have been explored include MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1.
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, features well-ordered channels, controllable uniform pore size (210 nm), and large surface area, and can be incorporated by heteroatoms, such as Cr, into the wall substituting Si4+ and forming isolated active centers. (84) Direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods are effective in tuning the locations and coordination environments of the incorporated metal cations. (8486) Wang et al. have prepared Cr-incorporated MCM-41 catalysts by both DHT and TIE methods, and found different Cr species in the calcined forms. (58) DHT results in monochromate species on the wall surface of MCM-41, while TIE produces a large quantity of polychromate species other than monochromate. Despite such differences, both catalysts are reduced from Cr6+ to Cr3+ oxide clusters during reaction, which explains their analogous activity and selectivity (Table 2). X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements reveal the reduction of Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination in the formed monochromate species to Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction, in which Cr(VI)O4 is more active than Cr(III)O6. (80,81) CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by participating in the reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 in Cr-MCM-41 (Figure 5). In a later work, Piotr et al. have also found prominent activity and selectivity on MCM-41-supported CrOx catalysts with optimal Cr loading at 6.8 wt. % (Table 2). (64) Similarly, well-dispersed Cr species play a pivotal role in promoting the catalytic performance; yet differently, a redox cycle of Cr2+  Cr3+ is proposed (Figure 5), analogous to the scenario reported by Yun et al. (56) and Ohishi et al. (87) MSU-x features high surface area (6001000 m2 g1 and 35 nm pore size) and 3D wormlike channels, which can potentially improve the dispersion of Cr species and facilitate the diffusion of reagent molecules. (88) For these reasons, Liu et al. have prepared Cr-MSU-x catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (i.e., 120 wt. %) for CO2ODHP. (65) C3H8 conversion reaches the highest at Cr = 5 wt. % at 550 C (Table 2). At 600 C, C3H8 conversion is as high as 50%, and C3H6 selectivity is 83.5%. A Cr loading-dependent transformation of Cr sites has been evident in the calcined catalysts, such as Cr(VI) in monochromate  V(VI) in di/trichromates  crystalline/amorphous α-Cr2O3. The trade-off between active Cr(VI) and α-Cr2O3 with elevated Cr loading determines the optimized Cr loading at 5 wt. %, and coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) ions are active sites responsible for dehydrogenation.
A comparative study, led by Zhang et al., finds that a SBA-15-supported Cr catalyst exerts better catalytic performance and stability than γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2-supported counterparts for CO2ODHP (Table 2). (60) Such prominent activity and coking resistance are associated with the preservation of active Cr(III) species in the presence of CO2, weak metalsupport interactions, and the high surface area of the support. Similarly, SBA-1 is also a promising candidate not only because of its high surface area, narrowed pore size, and 3D channels but also due to its characteristic cubic mesoporous phase, which is mechanically more stable than materials with hexagonal mesopores. (89,90) This is valuable for industrial applications where catalyst shaping processes are necessary. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-SBA-1 catalysts via a direct synthesis method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonium dichromate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as surfactant, Cr precursor, and Si source, respectively. (66) The as-prepared catalysts present characteristic 3D pore structures, though the incorporation of Cr results in limited perturbation of the structural order. The catalytic performance varies depending on the Cr/Si molar ratios and reaches optimal performance at Cr/Si = 0.04 (Table 2). The same group has also continued their work by exploring the Cr loading-dependent evolution of Cr species on Cr/SBA-1 catalysts. (59) Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is used to prepare the catalysts because this allows a higher density of active sites, while preserving the pore structure. Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 have been observed on Cr/SBA-15 catalysts in the calcined form, with Cr loading increasing from 1 to 15 wt. %. Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and dichromates present in all catalysts, regardless of Cr loadings; Cr5+ species exist at Cr loading below 7 wt. %; inactive α-Cr2O3 species can be detected at a Cr loadings higher than 5 wt. %. As compared in Table 2, the catalytic performance reaches maximum at Cr = 7 wt. % and barely changes with elevated Cr loadings, which is associated with the dominance of inactive α-Cr2O3 species. Similarly, activity performance is a function of well-dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ sites and the redox cycle, the formation of which stems from the rapid reduction of Cr6+ species upon contact with C3H8.
To better disperse CrOx species and facilitate mass transfer within the pores, TUD-1, with high surface area and unique 3D mesoporous network structure, has been introduced as support. (11) To ascertain the formation of CrOx with small, uniform crystals, a microwave irradiation method is used to prepare the catalysts. 5%Cr/TUD-1 exhibits higher C3H8 conversion at 24% and C3H6 selectivity at 90% at 550 C (Table 2), while good stability at 8 h on stream is observed on 7%Cr/TUD-1. High catalytic performance can be attributed to the unique 3D mesoporous structure enabling the encapsulation of CrOx particles with high dispersion.
Activated Carbons (ACs) ACs are also promising support materials because of their high surface area and abundant surface oxygen functional groups (OFGs) with tunable acidbase properties. Kutrowski et al. have introduced HNO3-activated AC with high surface area support for Cr catalysts and obtained optimal catalytic performance at Cr = 5 wt. % (Table 2). (67) Carbonyl and carboxyl species, known as respective basic and acid OFGs on the surface of AC, are identified as additional active sites in the reaction. Their gradual reduction with time on stream (TOS) is linked with the fast deactivation other than coking.
