1.Among the M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. In the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-MCM-41-DHT, the selectivity to propene was higher than 90% with a yield of 30%, and the presence of carbon dioxide enhanced propane conversion. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction.

1.在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中，Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性，导致丙烯的转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。通过DHT方法制备的Cr-MCM-41主要存在单铬酸盐物种，而通过TIE方法制备的Cr-MCM-41存在几种类型的铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。在Cr-MCM-41-DHT上丙烷的脱氢反应中，丙烯的选择性高于90%，产量为30%，二氧化碳的存在增强了丙烷的转化。两种样品上的铬酸盐物种在脱氢反应中被还原为聚集的Cr(III)，具有八面体配位。在反应前，样品显示铬的四面体配位（总配位数=3.9）。在CO2气氛下反应0.5小时后，结构完全变为八面体配位（总配位数=6.1）。结论是，Cr-MCM-41-DHT在反应前存在四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4，在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6。
