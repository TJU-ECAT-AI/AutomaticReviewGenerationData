[1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
[3] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (to- tal coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
[4] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahe- dral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by car- bon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an impor- tant role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

1.Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested for the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the type of metal incorporated, the method of preparation, and the properties of the support. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties plays a crucial role. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis method, while several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the template-ion exchange method. The chromium species in the as-synthesized samples by both methods exist in small Cr(III) oxide clusters with octahedrally coordinated chromium, and these species are transformed to chromate species with tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) after calcination. During the reaction, Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination is reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination. The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra is important in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

1.Cr-MCM-41催化剂在测试的M-MCM-41催化剂中显示出最高的活性，用于丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应，导致丙烯的转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。影响它们催化性能的关键因素包括所掺入金属的类型、制备方法和支持物的性质。在Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数起着关键作用。在直接水热合成方法制备的Cr-MCM-41上，主要存在单铬酸盐物种，而在模板离子交换方法制备的Cr-MCM-41上，存在几种类型的铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。两种方法制备的样品中的铬物种最初以小Cr(III)氧化物簇的形式存在，其中铬以八面体配位，这些物种在煅烧后转化为Cr(VI)的四面体配位的铬酸盐。在反应过程中，四面体配位的Cr(VI)被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)。Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
