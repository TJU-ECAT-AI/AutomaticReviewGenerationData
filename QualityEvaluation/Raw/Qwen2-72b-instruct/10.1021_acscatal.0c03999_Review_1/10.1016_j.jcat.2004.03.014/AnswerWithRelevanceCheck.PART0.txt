          [1] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
          [3] "The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The results obtained by curve fitting of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS are shown in Table 3,which confirm the tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for the sample before the reaction."
          [5] "After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1)."
          [6] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
          [7] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

          Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%. Monochromate species mainly exist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. Before the reaction, the sample shows tetrahedral coordination of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9). After the reaction for 0.5 h under a CO2 atmosphere, the structure was totally changed to the octahedral coordination (total coordination number = 6.1). It is concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 exists on Cr-MCM-41-DHT before the reaction and is reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III)O6 during the reaction. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

          Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳脱氢反应中表现出最高的活性，丙烯的转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。DHT方法制备的Cr-MCM-41主要存在单铬酸盐物种，而TIE方法制备的Cr-MCM-41存在几种类型的铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。两种样品上的铬酸盐物种在脱氢反应中被还原为聚集的Cr(III)，具有八面体配位。在反应前，样品显示铬的四面体配位（总配位数=3.9）。在CO2气氛下反应0.5小时后，结构完全变为八面体配位（总配位数=6.1）。结论是，Cr-MCM-41-DHT在反应前存在四面体配位的Cr(VI)O4，在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的Cr(III)O6。还原的Cr(III)O6八面体可以通过二氧化碳氧化为Cr(VI)O4四面体，因此Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上丙烷与二氧化碳脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
