1.Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳脱氢反应中表现出最高的活性，丙烯的转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。DHT方法制备的Cr-MCM-41主要存在单铬酸盐物种，而TIE方法制备的样品中存在包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐在内的多种铬酸盐物种。两种样品中的铬酸盐物种在脱氢反应中被还原为具有八面体配位的聚集Cr(III)。通过k3加权Cr-K边EXAFS的傅里叶变换曲线拟合结果证实，反应前样品中铬的配位数为3.9，呈四面体配位。在CO2气氛下反应0.5 h后，结构完全变为八面体配位(总配位数=6.1)。结论是，在反应过程中，丙烷被Cr(IV)O4四面体脱氢为丙烯，同时被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。还原的Cr(III)O6八面体可以通过二氧化碳重新氧化为Cr(VI)O4四面体，因此Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原氧化循环在Cr-MCM-41上丙烷与二氧化碳脱氢反应中起着重要作用。
