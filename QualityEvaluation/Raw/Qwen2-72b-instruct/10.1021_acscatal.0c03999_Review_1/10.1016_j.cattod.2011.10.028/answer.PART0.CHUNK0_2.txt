1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that the activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support. CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。然而，它确实提到Cr/SiO2的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢中起着重要作用，与支持物无关。CO2可以在反应条件下将Cr(III)物种的一部分氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
