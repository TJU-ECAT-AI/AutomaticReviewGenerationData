I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

The activity of  Cr/SiO2 was  enhanced with  increasing the partial pressure of  CO2,  while  the activity of  Cr/Al2O3 was  remarkably reduced by  the  addition of  a  small amount of
CO2.  Kinetic
analysis suggested that  CO2 adsorbed on  Al2O3 inhibited the  adsorption of  C3H8,  and  that CO2 reduced the  activity of  Cr/Al2O3.  Cr  K-edge XAFS  spectra and  TPR  profiles indicated that the  redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and  Cr(VI)O4 had  an  important role  in  the dehydrogenation of  C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of  the  support.
CO2 could  oxidize a  part  of Cr(III) species to  Cr(VI)  species under the  reaction condition.
As  a result,  in  the  case  of Cr/SiO2,  the oxidative dehydrogenation of  C3H8 over  Cr(VI) species took  place in  addition to  the  simple dehydrogenation over  Cr(III) species. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction Catalytic conversions of alkanes into the corresponding alkenes are of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes.
Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene,propene,and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2].
The dehydrogenation of alkanes is endothermic and inevitably controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium,requiring substantial energy consumption.
Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydro- genation of lower alkanes [39],or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10],however,the use of oxygen as an oxidant is frequently accompanied by deep oxidation,resulting in a decrease in product selectivity.
Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation,because CO2 can also act as a mild oxi- dant,and utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,such as CO2 reforming of methane [1113] and oxida- tive coupling of methane [14],has been reported.
CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylben- zene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]. However,the role of
CO2
in the dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction are still under discussion.
In this study,we investigated (1) the kinetic analysis for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr/SiO2 Corresponding author.

<questions>


How do various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, and what are the key factors influencing their catalytic performance, with particular emphasis on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
