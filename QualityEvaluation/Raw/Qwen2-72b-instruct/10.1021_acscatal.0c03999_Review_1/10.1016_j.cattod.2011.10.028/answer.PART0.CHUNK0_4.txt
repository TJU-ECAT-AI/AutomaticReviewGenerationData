1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP in terms of activity and selectivity. However, it does mention that the activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the support properties and the evolution of chromium species. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support. CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性。但是，它确实提到Cr/SiO2的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。影响催化性能的关键因素是载体性质和铬物种的演变。Cr K-edge XAFS光谱和TPR剖面表明，无论载体如何，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上C3H6的脱氢中起着重要作用。CO2可以在反应条件下将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
