If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, nor does it detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. However, it does mention that the activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support. CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition.

1.文献没有直接比较各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性，也没有详细描述负载Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载量和支持物性质的函数。然而，它确实提到Cr/SiO2的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢中起着重要作用，与支持物无关。CO2可以在反应条件下将Cr(III)物种的一部分氧化为Cr(VI)物种。

However, it does mention that the activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. The key factors influencing the catalytic performance are the support properties and the evolution of chromium species. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support. CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition.
