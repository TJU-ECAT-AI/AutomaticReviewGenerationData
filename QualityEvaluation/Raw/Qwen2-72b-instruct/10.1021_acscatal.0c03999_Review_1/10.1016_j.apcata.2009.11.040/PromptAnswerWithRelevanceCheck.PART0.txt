Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."
[2] "In the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities."
[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+),whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading,the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[4] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

1.Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the process with CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in chromium oxide-based catalysts is due to its oxidative abilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts requires redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+), whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium, and the nature of the support. In SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates or polychromates) dominate at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected. At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion, nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.

1.铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在与CO2的反应中是最活跃、最选择性和最稳定的。在铬氧化物基催化剂中，CO2对丙烯产量的促进作用是由于其氧化能力。在铬氧化物基催化剂中，需要Cr的氧化还原物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+），其浓度主要取决于铬的负载量、制备条件、铬的前体化合物和支撑物的性质。在SiO2支撑的铬氧化物催化剂中，氧化还原Cr物种（主要是以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+）在低Cr负载量下占主导地位，此时预期Cr的分散度较高。在高Cr负载量和低分散度下，非氧化还原的聚合Cr3+物种和结晶Cr2O3也存在。
