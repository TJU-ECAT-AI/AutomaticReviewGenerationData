The hydroxyl anchoring method represents a novel and controllable strategy for enhancing metal-support interactions in heterogeneous catalysts, leading to the fabrication of well-tuned catalytic materials with significantly improved performance. This method involves the strategic placement of hydroxyl groups on the support surface, which act as anchoring sites for metal nanoparticles. By precisely controlling the density and distribution of these hydroxyl groups, researchers can fine-tune the strength of metal-support interactions, thereby optimizing the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst. This level of control over the catalyst structure not only enhances the stability and dispersion of the active metal nanoparticles but also promotes stronger metal-support electronic interactions, which are crucial for catalytic activity and selectivity. Consequently, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the creation of heterogeneous catalysts with tailored properties, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in various chemical transformations.
