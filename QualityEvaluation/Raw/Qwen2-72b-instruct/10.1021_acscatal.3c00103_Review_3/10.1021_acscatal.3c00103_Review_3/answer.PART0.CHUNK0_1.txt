1.The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds. This is achieved through the use of hydroxyl groups on crystal materials, which can be utilized to graft metal active sites onto the support via the formation of strong covalent MO bonds. The method allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support by anchoring them on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests. This approach, known as surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), enables the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures, resulting in the generation of highly dispersed metal oxide species. The SOMC approach can achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, leading to the construction of strong metal-support interactions. This method has implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.羟基锚定方法通过在晶体材料上提供微妙的环境来固定金属位点或锚定金属化合物，从而实现对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这通过利用晶体材料上的羟基来在支撑上固定金属活性位点，形成强共价MO键来实现。该方法通过在孤立的羟基和/或羟基巢上锚定活性化合物，实现对支撑上活性化合物的可控掺入。这种被称为表面有机金属化学（SOMC）的方法，使定制支撑上的羟基与特定的热解分子前体在高温下进行选择性反应，生成高度分散的金属氧化物物种。SOMC方法可以在原子水平上实现对金属支撑催化剂的精确调整，从而构建强金属-支撑相互作用。该方法对增强金属-支撑相互作用、提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性具有重要意义。
