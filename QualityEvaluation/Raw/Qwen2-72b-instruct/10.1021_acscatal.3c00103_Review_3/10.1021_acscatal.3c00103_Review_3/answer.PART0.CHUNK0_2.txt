1.The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds. This is achieved through the use of hydroxyl groups on crystal materials, which can be utilized to graft metal active sites onto the support via strong covalent MO bonds. The method allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support by anchoring them on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach, which is a precise molecular method, can be used to graft metal active sites onto the support by reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors under high temperatures. This results in the generation of highly dispersed metal oxide species. The SOMC approach can also achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, which is beneficial for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.羟基锚定方法通过在晶体材料上提供微妙的环境来固定金属位点或锚定金属化合物，从而实现对活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这可以通过利用晶体材料上的羟基来实现，这些羟基可以用于通过形成强共价MO键将金属活性位点固定在支撑上。该方法通过在孤立的羟基和/或羟基巢上锚定活性化合物，实现了对支撑上活性化合物的可控掺入。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法是一种精确的分子方法，可以利用支撑上的有机基团（通常是羟基）将金属活性位点固定在支撑上。通过在高温下将定制支撑上的羟基与特定的热解分子前体（如金属烃基、硅氧烷和醇盐）进行选择性反应，可以生成高度分散的金属氧化物物种。SOMC方法还可以在原子水平上实现对金属支撑催化剂的精确调整，这对增强金属支撑相互作用和提高固体气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性有益。
