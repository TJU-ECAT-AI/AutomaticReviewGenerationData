1.The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds on hydroxyl groups. This approach allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support, either by grafting or confining them on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method, which utilizes the organic groups on the support, can graft metal active sites on the support by forming strong covalent MO bonds. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. The SOMC approach can achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, leading to the construction of strong metal-support interactions and the improvement of activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.羟基锚定方法通过在晶体材料上提供微妙的环境来固定金属位点或锚定金属化合物，从而实现对活性金属化合物的可控掺入。该方法允许通过在孤立的羟基或羟基巢上进行嫁接或限制，实现对支撑上的活性化合物的可控掺入。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法利用支撑上的有机基团，通过形成强共价MO键将金属活性位点嫁接到支撑上。通过在高温下选择性地使定制支撑上的羟基与特定的热解分子前体（TMPs）反应，可以生成高度分散的金属氧化物物种。SOMC方法可以在原子水平上实现对金属支撑催化剂的精确调整，从而构建强金属-支撑相互作用，提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
