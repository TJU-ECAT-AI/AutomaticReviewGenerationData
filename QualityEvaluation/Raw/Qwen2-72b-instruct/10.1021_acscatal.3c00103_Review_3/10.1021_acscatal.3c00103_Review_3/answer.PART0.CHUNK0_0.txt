1.The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds on hydroxyl groups. This method allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support, which can be accomplished through grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach, which utilizes the organic groups on the support to form strong covalent MO bonds, can be used to graft metal active sites on the support. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. The SOMC approach can also achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, which is effective for constructing strong metal-support interactions. This method has implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.羟基锚定方法通过在晶体材料上提供一个微妙的环境来固定金属位点或锚定金属化合物，从而实现对活性金属化合物的可控掺入。该方法允许通过在孤立的羟基和/或羟基巢上嫁接或限制活性位点来在载体上可控地掺入活性化合物。表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法，利用载体上的有机基团形成强共价MO键，可用于在载体上嫁接金属活性位点。通过在高温下选择性地使定制载体上的羟基与特定的热解分子前体（TMPs）反应，可以生成高度分散的金属氧化物物种。SOMC方法还可以在原子水平上实现对金属载体催化剂的精确调整，这对于构建强金属-载体相互作用是有效的。该方法对增强金属-载体相互作用，提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性具有重要意义。
