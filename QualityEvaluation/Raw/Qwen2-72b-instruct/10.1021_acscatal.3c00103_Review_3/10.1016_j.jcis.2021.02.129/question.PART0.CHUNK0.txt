Regular Article Enhanced performances of bimetallic Ga-Pt nanoclusters confined within silicalite-1 zeolite in propane dehydrogenation Abstract Ga-based catalysts are promising for use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of the relatively superior activity, but the conventional Ga-based catalysts usually suffer from serious deactivation and unsatisfactory propene selectivity. Here, ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) were synthesized by a facile ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method. It is indicated that this catalyst is composed of confined ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters and a part of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species. The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propene formation rate of 20.5 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over GaPt@S-1 catalyst even after 24 h on stream at 600 C, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h1, which is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts. Notably, the restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.
Graphical abstract The electronic effect in GaPt@S-1 catalyst hinders the adsorption of products on metal surfaces, and contributes to the migration of coke precursors from active sites to external channels, thus this catalyst achieves excellent PDH performance.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important feedstocks employed in the production of high valued chemical products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] . Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas. In recent years, Pt-Sn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH processes, but the former is expensive and the latter is toxic [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] . Moreover, both of them are easily deactivated and require frequent regeneration. These factors limit the further development of PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent.Alternatively, among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] , zinc oxide [13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] , gallium oxide [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] , etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process. However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application. The preparation of Ga-based catalysts with superior catalytic performance is very important from both industrial and academic points of view.
Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26] . Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds. In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products [6] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] . However, the surface Pt species of this catalyst usually suffer from poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop platinum-modified gallium catalysts with outstanding durability.
Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications [26] ,[34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] . Nevertheless, there is no report on the zeolite-encaged Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst applied for PDH with excellent catalytic activity and stability, not mention to the study of the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst within zeolite for PDH reaction.
Herein, highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters encapsulated within a purely siliceous silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were prepared by an in situ method of hydrothermal process and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction. Monometallic Pt and Ga catalysts within S-1 zeolites were also synthesized for comparison purposes. Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH. Furthermore, the active sites of GaPt@S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of XRD, DR UVvis, XPS and the calculation of turnover rate (TOR). The electronic effect of GaPt alloy as well as the influence of electronic effect on the desorption of products were investigated in detail. Besides, the influence of acidity on the reaction and the confinement effect of zeolites were also studied and discussed.

Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [38] . The GaPt@S-1 catalyst was prepared with the weight composition of 1.0 SiO2: 1.4 TPAOH: 10.5 H2O: 0.046 x [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3: 0.025 y [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 (x and y are the weight ratio of Ga and Pt in the mixture, respectively) under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 C for 4 d. The detailed preparation of [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 and [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3 solution is shown in
