1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the literature discusses the Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach, which facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by exploiting the formation of covalent bonds between molecular species and supports through grafting. This method allows for the generation of uniform supported, isolated species and supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for heterogeneous catalysts include improved activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions due to the precise molecular control and explicit study of the interplay between structure and activity.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提到羟基锚定方法，但讨论了表面有机金属化学（SOMC）方法，该方法通过在分子物种和支撑物之间形成共价键来实现活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许生成均匀的支撑、孤立物种和具有窄粒径分布的支撑金属纳米颗粒，从而增强金属-支撑物相互作用。对于多相催化剂而言，其在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性得到提高，这是由于精确的分子控制和结构与活性之间相互作用的明确研究。
