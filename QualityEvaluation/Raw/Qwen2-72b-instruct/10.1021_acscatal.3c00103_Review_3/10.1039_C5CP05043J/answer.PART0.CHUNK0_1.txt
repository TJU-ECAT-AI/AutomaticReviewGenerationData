1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction that ensures uniform film uniformity on almost any substrate, including zeolites. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant. ALD allows for the precise tailoring of the size and structure of metal clusters, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. The high dispersion of metal species and the prevention of aggregation can enhance the accessibility of reactants to active sites, leading to higher activity and selectivity. Additionally, the strong metal-support interactions resulting from ALD can improve the stability of the catalysts by preventing metal leaching or sintering under reaction conditions.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提到羟基锚定方法，但原子层沉积（ALD）技术通过允许对活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的分散和形式进行精确控制，促进了活性金属化合物的受控掺入。这是通过自限制表面反应实现的，该反应确保了几乎任何基底（包括沸石）上的薄膜均匀性。对于增强金属-支撑物相互作用以及提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的影响是显著的。ALD允许精确调整金属簇的大小和结构，这可以导致催化性能的提高。金属物种的高分散和防止聚集可以增强反应物对活性位点的可及性，从而导致更高的活性和选择性。此外，ALD产生的强金属-支撑物相互作用可以提高催化剂的稳定性，防止在反应条件下金属的流失或烧结。
