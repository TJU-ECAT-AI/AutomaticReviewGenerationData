1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique used in the study allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds, such as ZnO, into crystal materials like ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The ALD process involves the alternate exposure of precursors to the substrate, leading to the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species during the first cycle of deposition. These species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite. Subsequent cycles result in the growth of ZnO clusters. The precise control over the dispersion and form of active species achieved through ALD can enhance metal-support interactions, which in turn can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提及羟基锚定方法，但研究中使用的原子层沉积（ALD）技术允许将活性金属化合物，如ZnO，有控制地掺入到ZSM-5和Y沸石等晶体材料中。ALD过程涉及将前体交替暴露于基底，导致在沉积的第一周期形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种。这些物种通过沸石的晶格氧锚定在支撑物上。随后的周期导致ZnO簇的生长。通过ALD实现的对活性物种的分散和形式的精确控制可以增强金属-支撑物的相互作用，这反过来可以提高在固-气反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
