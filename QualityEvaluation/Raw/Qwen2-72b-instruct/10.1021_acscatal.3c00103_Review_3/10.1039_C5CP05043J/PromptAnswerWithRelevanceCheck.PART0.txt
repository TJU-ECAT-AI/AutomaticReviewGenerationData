1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique used in the study allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing ZnO onto the internal and external surfaces of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. This method facilitates the precise control over the dispersion and form of active species, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion, with higher activities and selectivities to desired products compared to the unmodified zeolites.

1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction that ensures uniform film uniformity on almost any substrate, including zeolites. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant. ALD allows for the precise tailoring of the size and structure of metal clusters, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. The high dispersion of metal species and the prevention of aggregation can enhance the accessibility of reactants to active sites, leading to higher activity and selectivity. Additionally, the strong metal-support interactions resulting from ALD can improve the stability of the catalysts by preventing metal leaching or sintering under reaction conditions.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提到羟基锚定方法，但原子层沉积（ALD）技术通过允许对活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的分散和形式进行精确控制，促进了活性金属化合物的受控掺入。这是通过自限制表面反应实现的，该反应确保了几乎任何基底（包括沸石）上的薄膜均匀性。对于增强金属-支撑物相互作用以及提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的影响是显著的。ALD允许精确调整金属簇的大小和结构，这可以导致催化性能的提高。金属物种的高分散和防止聚集可以增强反应物对活性位点的可及性，从而导致更高的活性和选择性。此外，ALD产生的强金属-支撑物相互作用可以提高催化剂的稳定性，防止在反应条件下金属的流失或烧结。

1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique used in the study allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds, such as ZnO, into crystal materials like ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The ALD process involves the alternate exposure of precursors to the substrate, leading to the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species during the first cycle of deposition. These species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite. Subsequent cycles result in the growth of ZnO clusters. The precise control over the dispersion and form of active species achieved through ALD can enhance metal-support interactions, which in turn can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提及羟基锚定方法，但研究中使用的原子层沉积（ALD）技术允许将活性金属化合物，如ZnO，有控制地掺入到ZSM-5和Y沸石等晶体材料中。ALD过程涉及将前体交替暴露于基底，导致在沉积的第一周期形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种。这些物种通过沸石的晶格氧锚定在支撑物上。随后的周期导致ZnO簇的生长。通过ALD实现的对活性物种的分散和形式的精确控制可以增强金属-支撑物的相互作用，这反过来可以提高在固-气反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction where two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively to react with surface functional groups, ensuring uniform film deposition on the substrate. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions include the ability to tailor the size and distribution of metal clusters, which can lead to optimized catalytic properties. The ALD process can produce highly dispersed metal species that are more effective for certain reactions, as demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion.
