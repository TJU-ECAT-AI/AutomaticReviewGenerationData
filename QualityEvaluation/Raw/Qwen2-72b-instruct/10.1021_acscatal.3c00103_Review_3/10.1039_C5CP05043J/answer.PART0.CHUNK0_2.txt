1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This method enhances metal-support interactions by ensuring that metal species are anchored to the support through chemical reactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提到羟基锚定方法，但原子层沉积（ALD）技术通过允许对活性物种的分散和形式进行精确控制，促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的受控掺入。该方法通过确保金属物种通过化学反应锚定在支撑上，增强了金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
