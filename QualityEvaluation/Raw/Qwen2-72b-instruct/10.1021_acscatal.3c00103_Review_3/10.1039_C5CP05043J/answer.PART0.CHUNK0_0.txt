1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique used in the study allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by depositing ZnO onto the internal and external surfaces of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. This method facilitates the precise control over the dispersion and form of active species, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion, with higher activities and selectivities to desired products compared to the unmodified zeolites.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提及羟基锚定方法，但所使用原子层沉积（ALD）技术允许在ZSM-5和Y沸石的内部和外部表面有控制地掺入活性金属化合物。该方法促进了对活性物种分散和形式的精确控制，增强了金属-载体相互作用。ALD ZnO改性沸石在丙烷转化中的催化性能提高，与未改性沸石相比，活性和选择性提高，这表明了在固-气反应中增强异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的含义。
