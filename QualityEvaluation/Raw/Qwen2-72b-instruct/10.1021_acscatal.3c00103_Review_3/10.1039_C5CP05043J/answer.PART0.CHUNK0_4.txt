1.The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction where two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively to react with surface functional groups, ensuring uniform film deposition on the substrate. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions include the ability to tailor the size and distribution of metal clusters, which can lead to optimized catalytic properties. The ALD process can produce highly dispersed metal species that are more effective for certain reactions, as demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion.

1.文献中虽然没有明确提到羟基锚定方法，但原子层沉积（ALD）技术通过允许对活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的分散和形式进行精确控制，促进了活性金属化合物的受控掺入。这是通过自限制表面反应实现的，其中两种气态前体交替脉冲，与表面功能基团反应，确保在基底上均匀的薄膜沉积。增强金属-支撑物相互作用以及提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的含义包括能够调整金属簇的大小和分布，这可以导致优化的催化性能。ALD过程可以产生高度分散的金属物种，这些物种对某些反应更有效，正如ALD ZnO改性沸石在丙烷转化中改善的催化性能所证明的那样。
