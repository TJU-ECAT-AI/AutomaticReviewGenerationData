1. The hydroxyl anchoring method for enhancing metal-support interactions in heterogeneous catalysts: A controllable approach to fabricating well-tuned catalytic materials with improved performance

The hydroxyl anchoring method, as elucidated in reference \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_3\], facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds on hydroxyl groups. This approach allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support, either by grafting or confining them on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method, which utilizes the organic groups on the support, can graft metal active sites on the support by forming strong covalent MO bonds. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. The SOMC approach can achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, leading to the construction of strong metal-support interactions and the improvement of activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

                    The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion, with higher activities and selectivities to desired products compared to the unmodified zeolites, as discussed in reference \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]. The ALD technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction that ensures uniform film uniformity on almost any substrate, including zeolites.

                    The SOMC approach, as described in reference \[10.1039/D0CS01424A\], allows for the generation of uniform supported, isolated species and supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for heterogeneous catalysts include improved activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions due to the precise molecular control and explicit study of the interplay between structure and activity.

                    The hydroxyl anchoring method, as described in the literature, is not explicitly mentioned. However, the literature discusses the use of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) approach to prepare bimetallic subnanometric and narrowly distributed PtZn alloyed particles supported on silica, as detailed in reference \[10.1039/C9SC05599A\]. This method allows for the stepwise introduction of specific elements via grafting to generate small, homogeneously and narrowly distributed supported alloyed nanoparticles at controlled interfaces. The resulting catalysts exhibit high productivity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of the hydroxyl anchoring method to achieve even more precise control over the dispersion and form of active species, leading to further improvements in the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The development of novel surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approaches and thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) could also be a promising direction for enhancing metal-support interactions and tailoring the size and distribution of metal clusters for optimized catalytic properties. Additionally, the integration of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the structure-activity relationships of these catalysts, guiding the design of next-generation materials with enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation and other solid-gas reactions.
