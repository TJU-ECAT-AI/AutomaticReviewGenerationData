This method facilitates the precise control over the dispersion and form of active species, enhancing metal-support interactions. The implications for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion, with higher activities and selectivities to desired products compared to the unmodified zeolites. The ALD technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species.
