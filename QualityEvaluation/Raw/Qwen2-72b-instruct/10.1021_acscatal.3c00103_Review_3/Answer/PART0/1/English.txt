The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant. ALD allows for the precise tailoring of the size and structure of metal clusters, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. The high dispersion of metal species and the prevention of aggregation can enhance the accessibility of reactants to active sites, leading to higher activity and selectivity. Additionally, the strong metal-support interactions resulting from ALD can improve the stability of the catalysts by preventing metal leaching or sintering under reaction conditions. The ALD technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This method enhances metal-support interactions by ensuring that metal species are anchored to the support through chemical reactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The ALD technique used in the study allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds, such as ZnO, into crystal materials like ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The ALD process involves the alternate exposure of precursors to the substrate, leading to the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species during the first cycle of deposition. These species are anchored to the support through the lattice oxygen of the zeolite. Subsequent cycles result in the growth of ZnO clusters. The precise control over the dispersion and form of active species achieved through ALD can enhance metal-support interactions, which in turn can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The ALD technique facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over the dispersion and form of active species. This is achieved through a self-limiting surface reaction where two gaseous precursors are pulsed alternatively to react with surface functional groups, ensuring uniform film deposition on the substrate. The implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions include the ability to tailor the size and distribution of metal clusters, which can lead to optimized catalytic properties. The ALD process can produce highly dispersed metal species that are more effective for certain reactions, as demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of ALD ZnO modified zeolites in propane conversion.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a subtle ambiance for grafting metal sites or anchoring metal compounds on hydroxyl groups. This approach allows for the controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support, either by grafting or confining them on isolated hydroxyls or hydroxyl nests. The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method, which utilizes the organic groups on the support, can graft metal active sites on the support by forming strong covalent MO bonds. By selectively reacting hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs) under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. The SOMC approach can achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level, leading to the construction of strong metal-support interactions and the improvement of activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
