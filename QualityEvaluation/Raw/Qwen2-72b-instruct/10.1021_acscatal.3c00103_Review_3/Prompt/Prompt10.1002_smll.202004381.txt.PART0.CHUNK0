Besides providing good protection for Au NCs, the surface ligands also play the following two important roles: i) as the outermost layer of Au NCs, the ligands will directly interact with the exterior environment (e.g., solvents, molecules and cells) influencing Au NCs in various applications; and ii) the interfacial chemistry between ligands and gold atoms can determine the structures, as well as the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs. A delicate ligand design in Au NCs (or other metal NCs) needs to consider the covalent bonds between ligands and gold atoms (e.g., goldsulfur (AuS) and goldphosphorus (AuP) bond), the physics forces between ligands (e.g., hydrophobic and van der Waals forces), and the ionic forces between the functional groups of ligands (e.g., carboxylic (COOH) and amine group (NH2)); which form the underlying chemistry and discussion focus of this review article. Here, detailed discussions on the effects of surface ligands (e.g., thiolate, phosphine, and alkynyl ligands; or hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligands) on the synthesis, structures, and properties of Au NCs; highlighting the design principles in the surface engineering of Au NCs for diverse emerging applications, are provided. 1 Introduction Surface engineering represents a forefront research topic in the field of metal nanoparticles (NPs),[1-3] as the ligand layer on the NP surface is a crucial and determinant component for their fundamental and applied research. As the outermost layer, the surface ligands of metal NPs will directly interface with the external environment (e.g., molecules, biomolecules, cells, and tissues), determining their performance in various applications. The effects of surface ligands become even more prominent in ultrasmall metal NPs with a core size less than 2 nm, or so-called metal nanoclusters (NCs).[4] Metal NCs typically contain several to hundreds of metal atoms, which are protected by a layer of organic ligands. Metal NCs have well-defined molecular formulae (i.e., [MnLm]q, where M and L denote the metal atoms and the protecting ligands, n and m refer to the numbers of the metal atoms and the ligands, respectively, and q is the net charge of the metal NCs) and molecular structures,[5, 6] as well as some intriguing molecule-like physical and chemical properties. Besides providing good protection for metal NCs in solution, the design of surface ligands is also crucial for the physical and chemical properties of ligand-protected metal NCs. For example, apart from affecting the core size,[7] stability, and solubility of metal NCs,[4] the surface ligands will also influence the physical and chemical properties of metal NCs, such as hydrodynamic size,[8] molecular chirality,[9] photoluminescence,[10] and optical absorption.[11] Metals in ligand-protected metal NCs can be gold (Au),[12] silver (Ag),[13, 14] and copper (Cu).[15, 16] Among the newly developed metal NCs in the past two decades, ligand-protected Au NCs have been studied and explored most intensively. Therefore, in this review article, we focus our discussions on ligand-protected Au NCs. However, some of the concepts and principles discussed in the Au NC system can also be extended to other metal NCs, such as Ag and Cu.
Various organic ligands can be used to protect Au NCs. An early example is phosphine, generating phosphine-protected Au NCs with different sizes.[17] Between the 1970s to 2000s, there were a number of successful attempts in the synthesis and characterizations of phosphine-protected Au NCs, as well as theoretical studies on their structures and the coordination nature.[18, 19] More recently (in the past two decades), another class of Au NCs protected by thiolate ligands has championed out as the forefront research in the cluster community, as thiolate-protected Au NCs (described as Aum(SR)n, where SR denotes thiolate ligand) possess good stability in solution due to the strong sulfurAu bonds and the aurophilic interactions between Au(I) atoms. The unique sulfur-Au(I) chemistry has facilitated the production of atomically precise Au NCs with different sizes and structures, further paving their way toward diverse emerging applications. Besides thiolate ligands, other organic ligands, such as selenolates (SeR),[20] tellurolates,[21] N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs),[22] and alkynes,[23] have also been used to produce atomically precise Au NCs, forming a unique class of ligand-protected Au NCs in the NP community.
In the ligand-protected Au NCs, surface ligand is a crucial component as it will affect both molecular properties and performance behaviors of Au NCs. For example, ligands will affect the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs, such as HOMOLUMO (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) electronic transitions,[24] photoluminescence,[25] discrete redox behavior,[26] intrinsic magnetism,[27] and optical chirality.[9] These properties can be further used to design functional Au NCs for various applications in the fields of optoelectronics,[28] sensing,[29] catalysis,[30] and biomedicine.[31, 32] Therefore, the design (and the choice) of the ligands on Au NCs can determine their performance and behaviors in the above applications.[4, 33-35] As illustrated in Scheme 1, the organic ligands on the Au NC surface consist of three parts. The inner part is the anchoring point that directly interacts with Au atoms (Au(I) or Au(0)). This part of the surface ligands can be sulfur (S), selenium (Se), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C), which can form strong covalent bonds with the Au atoms on the NC surface. Therefore, the anchoring point(s) of the surface ligands can directly determine the structures and physicochemical properties of Au NCs. The second part is the body (or middle part) of the surface ligands, such as the alkyl chains with different chain length, and the benzene rings with or without alkyl substituents. Besides providing conjugation effects, this part of the ligands features various molecular physics forces (e.g., hydrophobic and van der Waals forces) between the ligands on the NC surface, which will affect the structures and physicochemical properties of Au NCs via the steric hindrance[36] and electron transfer.[37] The third part of the surface ligands is the functional group on the ligand (mainly applicable to those hydrophilic ligands), such as carboxylic (COOH) and amine group (NH2).[38, 39] The functional groups on the hydrophilic Au NCs are important for their solubility in solution and performance in various emerging applications, as this ligand component will be the first layer of Au NCs to interface with the environment, including the solvents, molecules, biomolecules, cells, and tissues.[40, 41] Taken together, all the three parts of the surface ligands of Au NCs are important as they will work synergistically (as an entity) to determine the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs.[42-44] Therefore, in this review article, we will discuss the effects of surface ligands on the synthesis, structures, and properties of ligand-protected Au NCs, highlighting the design principles that can guide the surface engineering of Au NCs for various emerging applications.

Mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) is used as a ligand model. 2 Ligands Effects on the Synthesis of Ligand-Protected Au NCs The past two decades have witnessed significant developments in the synthesis of atomically precise ligand-protected Au NCs. Early studies in ligand-protected Au NCs often produced polydispersed Au NCs, which required a high-resolution separation technique to purify the products, such as gel electrophoresis,[45] thin-layer chromatography (TLC),[46] and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).[47, 48] Recent advances in the synthetic chemistry of Au NCs have made possible the direct synthesis of atomically precise Au NCs with high purity. There are two approaches to produce atomically precise Au NCs, which are one-step and two-step methods. In general, a one-step synthesis method can directly reduce Au ions to form atomically precise Au NCs with high purity. In contrast, a two-step synthesis method will first prepare either monodispersed or polydispersed Au NCs, and uses these NCs as precursors to synthesize atomically precise Au NCs, by using the size-focusing method, ligand-exchange-induced size/structure transformation (LEIST) method, ligand-exchange method, or seed-mediated growth method.
For both one- and two-step synthesis, the design of surface ligands is important to achieve efficient synthetic strategies to produce high quality Au NCs. Dating back to the early years of Au NC synthesis, the choice of surface ligands was always following those ligands used in Au NP synthesis.[49] In particular, the organic ligands that can form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au NPs or on the Au(111) surface are considered as promising ligands in synthesizing ligand-protected Au NCs. Such organic molecules include thiolate (SR), alkynyl (CCR), and phosphine (PR3) ligands, which have been successfully used to produce atomically precise Au NCs with different sizes and structures. We have highlighted some examples in Table 1. Besides providing good protection for the ultrasmall Au NCs in solution, the types of protecting ligands will also affect the design of underlying chemistry and synthetic strategies to produce ligand-protected Au NCs. In this section, we will discuss the underlying chemistry and synthetic strategies of Au NCs by using either hydrophobic or hydrophilic ligands, generating Au NCs that are soluble in either organic solvents or water, respectively.

2.1 Hydrophobic-Ligand-Protected Au NCs
The BrustSchiffrin method and its derivatives have been widely used to synthesize Au NCs protected by hydrophobic ligands. First reported in 1994, the BrustSchiffrin method can be used to synthesize thiolate-protected Au NPs via a two-phase system (Figure 1a).[102] It is very straightforward to adopt this method to produce thiolate-protected Au NCs.[103] In a typical synthesis of thiolate-protected Au NCs, the first step is to transfer the water-dissolved Au(III) ions (e.g., HAuCl4) into the organic phase by using a phase-transfer reagent (e.g., tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB)). The second step is to introduce both protecting ligands (e.g., hydrophobic thiolate ligands) and reducing agent (e.g., sodium borohydride (NaBH4)) to the reaction solution to induce the formation of Au NCs, which will be protected by hydrophobic thiolate ligands, forming organic-soluble Au NCs.[104] This method can be further modified to achieve Au NC synthesis in one phase, using a polar solvent like tetrahydrofuran (THF) and methanol.[4] A wide range of hydrophobic thiolate ligands can be used in this method, and some successful examples are Au24(SCH2Ph)20,[54] Au44(TBBT)28 (TBBT = 4-tert-butylbenzenethiolate),[77] Au64(S-c-C6H11)32 (S-c-C6H11 = cyclohexanethiolate),[105] and Au25(SC2H4Ph)18.[106] The reaction conditions, such as temperature and stirring rate, can also be used to further control the reaction kinetics to synthesize different sized Au NCs.

Besides providing good protection for the as-synthesized Au NCs, thiolate ligands can also be used as etchant to fine-tune the sizes of Au NCs, as thiol has strong interaction with Au atoms. The strong thiol-Au interaction forms the underlying chemistry for the size-focusing process (Figure 1e),[107] and this process has been widely used to produce atomically precise Au NCs. In particular, thiol-etching can be achieved at an elevated temperature, which can be used to convert polydispersed Au NCs to monodispersed ones with atomic precision. For example, excess hydrophobic thiolate ligands (in toluene) have been used to etch polydispersed Aum(SG)n NCs (SG denotes glutathione) to form Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, and Au144(SR)60 with high purity.[72, 73, 107] The design of thiolate ligands is also important in the ligand-exchange-induced size/structure transformation (LEIST) method in Au NC synthesis. The process of LEIST method is similar to that of the size-focusing method, as both processes use excess thiolate ligands in the second step to induce the transformation of Au NCs. The only difference is that in LEIST, a preformed monodispersed Au NC is used as the precursor for the transformation. It should be mentioned that LEIST often requires additional thermal energy (e.g., elevated temperature) to drive the size and structure conversion of Au NCs. In addition, in LEIST, the incoming ligands should be distinctly different from the outgoing ligands on the Au NC precursors.[108] For instance, at an elevated temperature of 80 C, Au38(SC2H4Ph)24 with a bi-icosahedral core can be converted to Au36(SPh-t-Bu)24 with a face-centered cubic (FCC) core, by using excess SPh-t-Bu ligands (the ratio of SPh-t-Bu to SC2H4Ph is about 160) (Figure 1f).[69] Interestingly, LEIST can be used to synthesize new Au NC species that are difficult to be achieved in one-step.[84, 109] Besides ligand exchange, a subtle change of the thiolate ligands will also affect the sizes of as-synthesized Au NCs. The effects of thiolate ligands on the NC sizes can be attributed to the following three factors: bulkiness of the α-carbon, substituent position of the benzenethiol, and bulkiness at the para-position of the benzenethiol. For the first factor (bulkiness of the α-carbon), the sizes of Au NCs can be affected by the type of α-carbon, showing a trend of size decrease in the sequence of Au NCs synthesized by the primary thiol (SCH2R), secondary thiol (SCHR2), and tertiary thiol (SCR3) ligands. For instance, different sized Au NCs were formed by changing the protecting ligands from HS-CH2CH4Ph (Au144) to HSPh (Au99).[110] Substituent position of the benzenethiol will also affect the sizes of Au NCs. For example, para-, meta-, and ortho-methylbenzenethiols (MBT) would produce Au130(p-MBT)50, Au104(m-MBT)41, and Au40(o-MBT)24, respectively, which suggests that the size of Au NCs decreases with the increasing hindrance of the methyl group to the interfacial AuS bond.[81] Furthermore, the bulkiness at the para-position of the benzenethiol can also affect the sizes of Au NCs. For example, 4-methylbenzenethiol can be used to produce Au130 NCs,[81] while 4-tertbutylbenzenethiol would lead to the formation of Au133 NCs.[84] Taken together, the above three factors suggest that the thiolate ligands with larger steric hindrance would prefer to the formation of smaller sized Au NCs. And this effect can be extended to other noble metal NCs, such as Ag NCs.[7] Besides thiolate ligands, other organic molecules such as selenolates, phosphines, and alkynyls have also been used to produce hydrophobic Au NCs. Selenolates are cognate derivatives of thiolates. There are two methods to synthesize selenolate-protected Au NCs: direct reduction of Au(I)-SeR complexes and ligand-exchange method using preformed Aun(SR)m precursors (thiolate-protected Au NCs). For example, Au(I)SeR complexes can be directly reduced by NaBH4 to form selenolate-protected Au25 NCs (i.e., Au25(Se-C8H17)18).[111] In addition, a high purity Au25(SeR)18 has been successfully produced by optimizing the reaction conditions, such as adding PhSeH and NaBH4 dropwise to a solution of Au(III) at the same time, adjusting the ratios of reactants (e.g., NaBH4-to-Au and PhSeH-to-Au ratio) and reaction temperature.[112] For the ligand-exchange method, monodispersed Au38(Se-C12H25)24 has been successfully synthesized by mixing Au38(S-C2H4Ph)24 (thiolate-protected Au38 NCs) with a certain selenolate ligand (i.e., didodecyldiselenide ligands (C12H25Se)2).[113] For phosphine-protected Au NCs, the Au(I)-phosphine complexes will be reduced to initiate the formation of Au NCs in a homogeneous solution. Besides using phosphine as the protecting ligand, phosphine-protected Au NCs often require a co-protecting ligand, such as halide anions and/or thiolate ligands, as these ligands or ions have strong coordination with Au atoms. Therefore, the molecular formulae of phosphine-protected Au NCs can be described as [Aun(PR3)mXs]z+ (X can be Cl, Br, I, CN, SCN, SR, etc.).[114] Taking the widely-studied phosphine-protected Au11 NCs as an example, Au11(PAr3)7X3 was formed in the NaBH4-reduction of Au(PAr3)3X in solution.[115, 116] The above-mentioned ligand design principle (i.e., the bulkier and more rigid ligands tend to form smaller Au NCs (vide supra)) is also applicable to those Au NCs synthesized by using phosphines as protecting ligands. For example, the main products of the NaBH4-reduction of chlorogold(I) complexes with the C2-bridged diphosphine (dppe) ligands in CH2Cl2/EtOH (50/50 v/v),[117, 118] are [Au9(dppe)5]3+, [Au11(dppe)5]3+, [Au12(dppe)5Cl]3+, [Au13(dppe)5Cl2]3+, and [Au15(dppe)6ClH]3+, which are smaller than the Au NCs (i.e., [Au38(dppp)9Cl2]4+ and [Au39(dppp)Cl3]4+) generated by using C3-bridged diphosphine (dppp) as protecting ligands in the same system.[118] In addition, the etching effect of ligands also exists in the phosphine system, which can be used in the size-focusing or LEIST methods for Au NC synthesis. For example, [Au8(PPh3)8]2+ was formed by etching [Au9(PPh3)8]3+ with the free PPh3.[119, 120] In addition, HCl can also serve as etchant in the synthesis of phosphine-protected Au NCs. For example, Au13 NCs were synthesized by HCl-etching of the mixture obtained from the NaBH4-reduction of Au2(PRn)2Cl2 (R = CH2, n = 2, 3, 4, 5) (Figure 1b).[117, 121] It is also worth noting that this etching method cannot be applied to the Au NCs protected by monodentate phosphines, as these NCs were unstable in solution and would decompose under a strong acidic condition.
In recent years, NHCs have attracted increasing interest in the cluster community to produce NHC-protected Au NCs, as NHCs can provide good protection for Au NCs.[122] For example, NHC-protected Au NCs have been successfully synthesized by using a ligand-exchange method, where phosphine-protected Au11(PPh3)7Cl3 and [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]Cl were first synthesized as precursors for a subsequent ligand-exchange with NHCs in solution.[109] In a follow-up work, highly luminescent [Au13(NHC)9Cl3]2+ NCs were successfully synthesized via a direct NaBH4-reduction of the NHCAu(I)Cl complexes, followed by the HCl-annealing process (Figure 1c,d).[123] Another successful attempt is one-pot synthesis of NHC-protected [Au25(iPr2-bimy)10Br7]2+ NCs (iPr2-bimy = 1,3-diisopropylbenzimidazolin-2-ylidene).[124] In the past decade, alkynyl-protected Au NCs have also been successfully synthesized. For example, a number of Aun(PhCC)m NCs, including Au46(PhCC)24, Au52(PhCC)26, Au54(PhCC)24, Au59(PhCC)27, Au71(PhCC)32, Au90(PhCC)36, Au94(PhCC)38, Au101(PhCC)38, and Au110(PhCC)40, have been successfully synthesized by ligating phenylacetylene (PhCCH) to the preformed PVP-stabilized Au NCs (PVP = poly(vinylpyrrolidone)).[125] In more recent years, a number of direct reduction methods have been developed to synthesize Aun(PhCC)m NCs with well-defined sizes and structures. For example, homoleptic alkynyl-protected Au NCs, such as Au44(CCPh)28 and Au36(CCPh)24, can be directly synthesized by introducing NaBH4 dropwise to a suspension of Au complexes (e.g., AuCCPh or AuCCAr).[99] Similarly, a number of mixed-ligand-protected Au NCs, such as [Au24(CCPh)14(PPh3)4](SbF6)2[126] and [Au19(PhCC)9(Hdppa)3](SbF6)2 (Hdppa = N,N-bis-(diphenylphosphino)amine),[127] were synthesized by using Au(I) complexes coordinated with two different ligands (e.g., Ph3PAuSbF6 and HdppaAu2(SbF6)2).
2.2 Hydrophilic-Ligand-Protected Au NCs
The synthetic methodologies discussed above can also be used to synthesize Au NCs protected by hydrophilic ligands. Among the hydrophilic ligands that have been used to protect Au NCs, glutathione (GSH = γ-GluCysGly, a naturally-occurring tripeptide) received the most attention. For example, a series of GSH-protected Aun NCs (n = 15,18 22, 25, 29, 33, 39) have been successfully synthesized and purified by using electrophoresis.[128] This method can be further modified to obtain Au NCs with a high yield.[129] Other hydrophilic thiolate ligands, such as 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA),[50, 59] 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA),[59] 8-mercaptooctanoic acid (MOA),[59] 11-mercaptoundecanic acid (MUA),[59] para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA),[76, 130] captopril (Capt),[61] and cysteine (Cys),[59, 131] can also be used to synthesize water-soluble Au NCs with well-defined sizes and structures.
In aqueous solution, the charge state of the ligand is important in the synthesis of stable Au NCs. It has been found that it is challenging to produce stable Au NCs in water by using small positively-charged thiolate ligands as protecting ligands. However, stable Au NCs can be readily synthesized in water if small negatively-charged thiolate ligands were used as protecting ligands.[132] Unlike the negatively-charged thiolate ligands, the cationic functional group of the positively-charged thiolate ligands has a strong Coulombic interaction with the anionic Au(I) group of the Au(I)-SR complexes. This can greatly change the solubility of the Au(I)-SR complexes, and therefore restrict the homogeneous reduction and growth of Au NCs.[133] Moreover, in the absence of the protection from the electronic double layers generated by the charged surface, Au NCs protected by a neutrally-charged organothiolate ligand are also not stable in solution, unless the protecting ligands are bulky (e.g., thioglucose).[132] For Au NCs protected by hydrophilic thiolate ligands, water is an ideal solvent for their synthesis. In a water-based synthesis, pH of the reaction solution is an important parameter that can affect the reduction kinetics and the subsequent cluster growth, as well as the thermodynamically stable thiolate-protected Au NCs in water. For example, we have developed a NaOH-mediated NaBH4-reduction method to synthesize atomically precise Au NCs with well-defined sizes and structures (Figure 2b).[59] This protocol is a facile one-step synthesis method. And the key in this method is the pH of the reaction solution, which can be readily achieved by the addition of NaOH in the reducing agent (NaBH4) in water. There are two effects for the addition of NaOH in the reaction solution: one is to retard the reducing power of NaBH4 (by inhibiting the hydrolysis rate of NaBH4), and the other is to increase the etching ability of free thiolate ligands in water. These two effects have made possible a simple and facile method to produce atomically precise Au NCs (e.g., Au25(SR)18) with high purity.[59, 134] Besides the solution pH, we have also studied the effects of temperature and ligand-to-Au ratio on Au NC synthesis. We found that a mild-heating (e.g., 40 C; or thermal energy input) of the reaction solution can accelerate and well-balance the reducing rate of NaBH4 and the size-focusing rate of Au NCs, which can shorten the required time to produce atomically precise Au NCs.[135] In addition, the ligand-to-Au ratio is also an important factor that can affect the NC synthesis.[136] Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a) Schematic illustration of the CO-reduction method to synthesize different sized Au NCs protected by hydrophilic thiolate ligands.

From the above discussions, we know that a delicate control of the reduction kinetics and the subsequent Au NC growth is crucial for the synthesis of atomically precise Au NCs in water. NaBH4 is widely used as reducing agent, however, NaBH4 has a strong reducing power, and it is difficult to control its reduction kinetics. To address this challenging issue, one straightforward approach is to replace NaBH4 by a milder reducing agent, and a gaseous reducing agent; carbon monoxide (CO) has recently emerged as a promising mild reducing agent for Au NC synthesis. In particular, CO can create a unique and mild reducing environment for Au NC formation, generating atomically precise Au NCs in water with well-controlled sizes and structures (Figure 2a).[50] In the past ten years, we have developed the CO-reduction method for the synthesis of water-soluble Au NCs, as well as some alloy metal NCs.[137-139] One salient feature for the CO-reduction method is its readily quenchable reaction, where CO can be easily purged out from the reaction solution to quench the reaction. This salient feature provides a good platform to identify the reaction intermediates toward the formation of atomically precise Au NCs, realizing the total synthesis of atomically precise Au NCs.[137] The CO-reduction method has been used to synthesize Au NCs protected by different hydrophilic thiolate ligands, such as Au15(SG)13, Au18(SG)14, Au25(SG)18, Au15(MPA)13, Au18(MPA)14, Au25(MPA)18,[50] and Au25(p-MBA)18.[130] Similar as the NaBH4-reduction method, pH of the reaction solution is also an important consideration in the CO-reduction method in water. In addition, the effect of pH on the NC synthesis is more prominent in Au NCs protected by hydrophilic thiolate ligands, as the solution pH will also affect the protonation or deprotonation of the thiolate ligands containing carboxylic (COOH) and/or amine group (NH2). In addition, pH will also affect the solubility of the thiolate ligands as well as the etching capability of the thiols. In general, an alkaline condition is used in the synthesis of Au NCs protected by thiolate ligands with a carboxylic group, such as MPA, MHA, and p-MBA,[50] because the deprotonated carboxylic groups can provide negative charges for Au NCs, and the electrostatic repulsions between Au NCs will offer them good colloidal stability in water. For more complicated hydrophilic thiolate ligands, such as glutathione (GSH, a tripeptide), an acidic condition can also be used to produce unique Au NC species, such as Au22(SG)18,[55] which was not formed in the system of NaBH4-reduction method. As shown in Figure 2c, red-emitting Au22(SG)18 can be synthesized by adjusting the solution pH to 2.5, after the CO-reduction of Au(I)-SG complexes at solution pH of 11.[32, 140] In addition to the small hydrophilic thiolate ligands, biomolecules with thiol groups (or other coordinating groups with Au atoms), such as proteins,[141] peptides,[142] and DNA,[143] can also be used to produce Au NCs in water. For example, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used to direct the synthesis of Au NCs, leading to the formation of red-emitting Au NCs encapsulated inside the BSA molecules (Figure 2d). This protein-directed synthesis method is simple and it can be easily extended to other proteins, such as pepsin,[144] trypsin,[145] and lysozyme,[146] as well as to other noble metals, such as Ag,[147] generating a promising class of protein-protected metal NCs, which are finding increasing acceptance in the biomedical applications.[148] 3 Ligands Effects on the Structures of Ligand-Protected Au NCs Ever since McPartlin obtained the crystal structure of Au11(PPh3)7(SCN)3 NCs in 1969,[88] single-crystal X-ray crystallography is the sole definitive method to elucidate the geometric structural features of ligand-protected Au NCs. Structures of more than one hundred kinds of Au NCs protected by various ligands have been reported over the past half century. Most ligand-protected Au NCs can be viewed as a core-shell structure where a core of metallic gold is capped by several ligands or staple-like motifs. The core-shell structures of ligand-protected Au NCs (including the staple and kernel structures) are determined by the coordination between the protecting ligands and the kernel surface Au atoms which are highly correlated to the protecting ligands. Moreover, in contrast to large Au nanoparticles (NPs), atomically precise Au NCs with smaller sizes can possess molecular chirality from their chiral skeletal structures at different levels.[149, 150] In this part, we first discuss the effects of ligands on their bonding modes with Au atoms and the staple structures. After that, we provide a detailed discussion on the arrangement of core gold atoms and the chirality of Au NCs at different levels.
3.1 Surface Configuration
In ligand-protected Au NCs, the bonding modes of ligands not only depend on the elements bonded with Au atoms, but also vary in different NCs with the same bonding element but different organic molecular structures. Thus, the shell structures of Au NCs are highly dependent on the overall characteristics of the ligands. Here, the bonding modes between the ligands and gold atoms and the staple structures of Au NCs are discussed by dividing the ligands into five categories: i) phosphines and NHCs, ii) thiolates, selenolates, and tellurolates, iii) α-alkynyls, iv) halide ions (Cl, Br, and I), and v) others; which are illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Coordination modes of a) monodentate, b) bidentate, and c) tetradentate phosphines; d) NHC, e) SR, f) S2, g) S4Au4, h) NR; and il) α-alkynyls. Color labels: gold atoms, green; phosphorus atoms, lilac; nitrogen atoms, blue; sulfur atoms, yellow; carbon atoms, gray.
Monodentate[151] and bidentate[17] phosphines (Figure 3a,b) have long been used to prepare Au NCs. Multidentate phosphines (Figure 3c), such as tetradentate phosphines, have also been used as protecting ligands for Au NCs (e.g., [Au20(PP3)4]4+).[93] Regardless of whether they are main auxiliary ligands, tertiary phosphines are capping on the kernel surface of Au NCs by AuP bonds between each terminal phosphorus atom and one Au atom. It should be noted that the bi-phosphines and tetra-phosphines can cap on Au NCs in staple modes,[152] but mono-phosphines cannot. NHCs and their derivatives behave similarly as tertiary phosphines in many aspects, such as coordination characteristics.[109, 123, 124] In these NCs, only a single AuC bond is formed between the Au atoms and the C atoms coordinated with two N atoms in the N-heterocycle, as shown in Figure 3d. Compared with their Au-PR3 analogues with the same geometric structure, NHC-protected Au NCs have higher thermal stability in water and air, due to the stronger σ-donor properties and higher alkalinity of the NHCs.
Unlike only bonding with one hydrogen atom in thiol/selenol/tellurol, the terminal S/Se/Te atom prefers to bind to two Au atoms in thiolate-/selenolate-/tellurolate-protected Au NCs, as shown in Figure 3e. Due to the similar coordination characteristics of thiolates, selenolates, and tellurolates in Au NCs, Aun(SR)m will be taken as an example to introduce their staple structures. Until now, thiolates are found to cap on the kernels of Au NCs in three ways: i) as a bridging thiolate, ii) as oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staple-like motifs, and iii) as closed Aux(SR)x ring-like structures. In the first mode (as a bridging thiolate), one thiolate ligand will bond with two Au atoms on the outermost shell of the metallic kernel which looks like a bridge. It should be noted that only a few types of AunSRm contain such bridging thiolates,[153] and some Au NCs protected with mixed ligands do not have them.[154, 155] Such bridging thiolates are preferred to cap in the <110> direction on the Au{100} surface of the face-centered-cubic (FCC) Au NCs, such as Au92SR44[156, 157] and Au279SR84.[158, 159] For the second mode, the oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staple-like motifs will cap on the metallic kernel by two terminal SRs, and the adjacent SRs will link with each other via an Au(I) atom in a linear fashion (the SAuS angle is close to 180). This kind of motifs can be widely found in the thiolate-protected Au NCs, such as monomeric Au(SR)2 staple motifs in Au102SR44,[39] Au130SR50,[83] Au133SR52,[84] and Au144SR60,[87] dimeric Au2(SR)3 in Au25SR18,[160] Au30SR18,[66] and Au38SR24,[161] trimeric Au3(SR)4 in Au23SR16,[162] tetrameric Au4(SR)5 in Au16SR12,[163] Au18SR14,[164] and Au24SR20,[56] and large octameric Au8(SR)9 in Au21SR15[153] and Au21SSR15.[165] For the third mode, the closed Aux(SR)x ring-like structures often exist in small Au(I)-SR complexes and small Au NCs, such as the Au8(SR)8 ring-like macrocycle in Au20SR16,[52] Au5(SR)5 and Au6(SR)6 rings in catenane-like Au10SR10, Au11SR11, and Au12SR12 complexes.[166] It should be noted that most of the Au NCs protected by thiolate ligands have more than one size of oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staple-like motifs.
When α-alkynyls are used as the ligands to protect Au NCs, except for the traditional coordination fashions that the terminal α-C atom would bond with one, two or three Au atoms by single CAu bonds (Figure 3ik), the AuC bonds between the βC and Au atoms also exist (Figure 3l). The alkynyl will cap on the metal core lonely when the terminal α-C atom bonds with one or three Au atoms, but the staple-like motifs (similar to the oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staples, especially monomeric SRAuSR and dimeric SRAuSRAuSR staples), also exist in Au NCs when the terminal α-C atom bonds with two Au atoms and the β-C bonds with one Au atom. Note that the Au-alkynyl staples have more bonding modes than the oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staples due to the different relative positions of Au atoms with the α-C and β-C atoms. The motif structures of Au-alkynyls in Au NCs have been discussed in a recent review.[167] Moreover, the closed ring-like structures, such as Au6(CCR)6 rings, are found in the Au22(CCR)18 NCs.[97, 168] In contrast to the above-mentioned ligands, carbon (except the terminal C in α-alkynyls) and nitrogen atoms in some organic molecules, halogen elements (i.e., Cl, Br, and I), and oxygen group elements (i.e., S and Se) can always protect Au NCs as auxiliary ligands. In halogen-protected Au NCs, halogen elements can bond with one or two kernel Au atoms, as well as to form the oligomeric staples (as observed in Au36(SCH2Ph-t-Bu)8Cl20 cluster).[169] Oxygen group elements (S and Se) exist in Au NCs as ligands in two ways (excluding the 4-S in kernel[170, 171]): one way is bonding with three Au atoms (Figure 3f),[67, 172, 173] and the other way is forming an Au4S4 ring motif (Figure 3g).[174, 175] Until now, only one kind of Au NCs, [Au32(PPh3)8(dpa)6]2+ (dpa = 2,2'-dipyridylamine), is protected by organic nitrogen ligands.[176] However, if the ligand contains an excess nitrogen atom, the N atom could bind to the kernel gold as the second functional group (Figure 3h), as observed in [Au20(Pphpy2)10]2+[92] and [Au11(PNC)6(PPh3)2]5+ (PNC = 2-diphenylphosphinopydirylmonoion).[177] Except for α-alkynyls, there are only a few reports on the C atoms as functional groups bonding with Au atoms in Au NCs, such as [Au11(PNC)6(PPh3)2]5+ (the C atoms in PNC) and [Au8(4,4-dimethyl-5,5-dihydrooxazole-2-C)2(PPh3)6]2+ (the C atoms in 4,4-dimethyl-5,5-dihydrooxazole-2-C).[178]
3.2 Core of the Au NCs
In Au NCs, not only the staple structures, but also the kernel structure and Au atom coordination fashions are related with the protecting ligands. Except some small Au NCs which are mainly protected by bidentate phosphines,[122, 179-181] each kernel Au atom is capped by at most one ligand in Au NCs as reported thus far.
In Au NCs protected by tertiary phosphines and NHCs, except those assembled as Au6 octahedral in [Au6(PR3)6][182] and packed in face-centered cubic (FCC) fashion in [Au39(PPh3)14Cl6]2+, Au atoms would mainly assemble in two ways. One way is forming core + exo geometries based on Au4 tetrahedrons in small Au NCs protected by bidentate phosphines.[183] The other way is based on Au13 icosahedrons, which exist in the monodentate and tetradentate phosphines,[90] as well as in those NHC-protected Au NCs.[124] In this way, Au atoms are assembled as part of Au13 icosahedron in small Au NCs,[184] accumulated on one Au13 icosahedron[93] or several Au13 icosahedrons connected with each other by co-vertex in large Au NCs.[185] Thiolate-, selenolate-, tellurolate-, as well as α-alkynyl-protected Au NCs contain similar core-shell structures, and the kernel Au atoms are always packed in the same way when they have the same number of Au atoms, which include Au25L18 (L: SR, SeR, CCR),[98] Au36L24 (L: SR, CCR),[101] Au44L28 (L: SR, CCR),[101] and Au144L60 (L: SR, CCR).[101] In the kernel-shell structural Au NCs reported thus far, the kernel Au atoms are mainly packed in ways shown below: face-centered cubic (FCC, e.g., Au36L24, Au44L28, Au92(SR)44, and Au279SR84), body-centered cubic (BCC, Au38S2(S-Adm)20[173]), hexagonal close-packed (HCP, Au18(SR)14[164] and Au30(S-Adm)18[66]), icosahedron (including single Au13 icosahedron, e.g., Au25L18 and Au38(SR)24T;[161, 186] bi-icosahedron co-planar, e.g., Au38(SR)24Q,[161] Au44(2,4-DMBT)26,[78] and Au48(TBBT)28;[187] and multilayer icosahedron, e.g., Au133(SR)52 and Au144L60), and decahedron (e.g., Au102(p-MBA)44, Au103S(SR)41,[188] and Au130(p-MBT)50).
3.3 Chiral Geometric Structure
All ligand-protected Au NCs show chirality in four different levels: i) chiral thiolate ligands; ii) chiral arrangement of the ligands on the surface of the NCs; iii) cis/trans isomerism in the bridged AuS binding motifs; and iv) inherent chirality of the core. We will discuss i), ii), and iii) in detail in this section.
The first is the chiral ligands, which mainly contain chiral thiolates and chiral phosphines. The chirality of thiolates mainly comes from the chiral atom in its organic chain, such as penicillamine, cysteine, L-glutathione, 1-methyl-2-phenylethylthiolate, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, camphorthiolate, and captopril. The chirality of the tertiary phosphines originates from three modes: 1) the phosphorus atom as a chiral center bonding with three different hydrocarbyl groups; 2) the chiral atom in the carbon tail; and 3) restricted rotation, such as 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)-2,3-o-isopropylidene-2,3-butanediol (DIOP) and 2,2-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl (BINAP). This chirality in ligand-protected Au NCs has been shown in a number of examples.[189, 190] The second is the arrangement of the ligands on the surface of the NCs. Such chirality commonly appears in the NCs with multiple symmetry axis but without the symmetry plane, and these NCs are generally protected by bidentate ligands, such as thiolates, selenolates, tellurolates, bidentate phosphines, and α-alkynyls.[99] The third is the cis/trans isomerism in the bridging AuS/AuSe/AuTe binding motifs.[149] Among the many types of ligands that have been used to protect Au NCs, only the S/Se/Te atoms in thiolates, selenolates, and tellurolates have four different substituents (two Au atoms in different positions, one carbon tail, and a lone pair electrons) in tetrahedral coordination geometry due to their sp3 hybridization, which renders them with stereogenic centers. For example, in an oligomeric Aux(SR)x+1 staple, the absolute configuration of the sulfur atoms (S or R configuration) can lead to 2x different stereoisomers.[149] Until now, the cis/trans isomerism of the staples in Au NCs is difficult to assess experimentally, but a trans isomerism is observed in an AuPd alloy NC (i.e., Au4Pd2SR8[191]), in which all of the eight sulfur atoms have unanimous R configuration in L-helix Au4Pd2(PET)8 and S configuration in R-helix one. And, four monomeric SRAuSR in the NCs are trans stereoisomers.[191] 4 Ligands Effects on the Physical and Chemical Properties of Au NCs The ultrasmall Au NCs feature strong quantum confinement effects, which render them some unique molecule-like properties, such as HOMOLUMO electronic transitions,[24] enhanced photoluminescence,[25] discrete redox behavior,[26] intrinsic magnetism,[27] and optical chirality.[9] The size and structure of the Au core in the ligand-protected Au NCs would determine their physical and chemical properties. However, recent studies also showed that ligands on the Au NC surface might also affect the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs. Therefore, the design of ligands on the Au NC surface is another efficient approach to control the physicochemical properties of Au NCs. In this section, we discuss the effects of ligands on the physicochemical properties of Au NCs, including photoluminescence, optical absorption, cluster stability in solution, and chemical reactivity; highlighting the principles in engineering pertaining to the surface ligands of Au NCs for diverse emerging applications.
4.1 Photoluminescence
Ligand-protected Au NCs feature strong luminescence due to their discrete electronic structures from the quantum confinement effects in the sub-2 nm size region. As discussed above, the organic ligands on Au NC surface consist of three parts: anchoring point, ligand body, and functional groups. All these three parts can affect the electronic structures and luminescence properties of Au NCs. Three efficient strategies have been developed to improve the luminescence of Au NCs. The first one is using the anchoring point of the ligand, to strengthen the charge transfer from the ligands to the Au core. The second approach is using the ligand body and its functional group, to enhance the direct transfer of the delocalized electrons of the electron-rich atoms from the ligands to the Au core.[192] The third approach is through the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) to enhance the luminescence of Au NCs, in which the properties of ligands can determine the AIE behaviors of Au NCs.
One can use the anchoring point of the ligands to further improve the luminescence of Au NCs. For example, instead of using monothiols, dithiols can be used as protecting ligands to further improve the charge transfer between the ligands and the Au atoms through the Au(I)S bonds, generating highly luminescent Au NCs with quantum yields (QYs) of 510%.[193] In another study, it was found that Au24(SePh)20 showed much weaker luminescence compared to thiolate-protected Au24 NCs, as the electron transfer is more difficult in Au(I)Se bonds compared to the Au(I)S bonds (Figure 4a).[194] A similar finding was also observed in the system of ligand-protected Au25 NCs, where a twofold improvement in the luminescence intensity was achieved by replacing the ligands of [Au25(SePh)18] by S-C2H4Ph.[195] Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a) Photoluminescence spectra of Au24(SC2H4Ph)20, Au24(SCH2Ph-t-Bu)20, Au24(SCH2Ph)20, and Au24(SePh)20.

For the ligand body, it was found that the thiolate ligands with a longer alkyl chain or containing a benzene ring can lead to the formation of Au NCs with stronger luminescence, for example, following the sequence of PhCH2CH2 > C12H25 > C6H13 in the luminescence intensity of the as-synthesized Au NCs. This observation is also consistent with the sequence of charge donating capability (Figure 4bd).[192] In another study, replacing SC2H4Ph in Au24 NCs with SCH2Ph or SCH2Ph-t-Bu has enhanced the luminescence of Au24 NCs. This finding is consistent with the theoretical calculations, which suggest that the kernel of Au24(SCH2Ph-t-Bu)20 would attract the delocalized electrons more strongly than that of Au24(SCH2Ph)20.[194] Another theoretical study also suggests that the length of ligand can affect the electronic and geometric structures of Au NCs, making the longer ligand-protected Au25 have lower emission energy and larger Stokes shift.[10] With regards to the functional groups on the protecting ligands, it was found that ligands containing electron-rich atoms (e.g., N and O) or groups (e.g., COOH and NH2) led to the formation of Au NCs with stronger luminescence. As a result, intense luminescence was often observed in the Au NCs protected by glutathione (GSH, rich with COOH and NH2), such as Au15(SG)13,[196] Au18(SG)14,[38] and Au22(SG)18.[55] Similarly, electron-rich thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has also been used to exchange the ligands of phenylethanethiolate on the NC surface, further enhancing the luminescence of as-synthesized Au NCs.[197] Aggregation-induced emission or AIE is an efficient method to improve the luminescence of Au NCs,[198] generating a unique class of AIE-type luminescent Au NCs.[25] To induce the aggregation of Au NCs or Au(I)-thiolate complexes on Au(0) core, the ligands on Au NC surface are crucial, as these ligands can induce the aggregation through the following three means. First, polarity of the ligands can induce the AIE of Au NCs. For example, hydrophilic ligands with functional groups, such as COOH and NH2, are highly polar molecules, and they exhibit good solubility in water. Therefore, introduction of a weakly polar solvent or bad solvents (e.g., ethanol) into the Au NCs protected by hydrophilic ligands in water will decrease the solubility of Au NCs, resulting in the aggregation of Au NCs, which can significantly improve their luminescence (Figure 5a,b).[25, 199] Second, ππ stacking from the benzene ring of the ligand body can also facilitate the aggregation of Au NCs. The ππ stacking from the aromatic ligands on Au NC surface can induce self-assembly of Au NCs, further confining the mobility of surface motifs on Au NCs and realizing enhanced luminescence.[200] Third, the functional groups of thiolate ligands on Au NC surface can also be used to induce the aggregation of Au NCs. For example, the quantum yield of Au22(SG)18 can reach to 60% by using tetraoctylammonium (TOA) cations to rigidify the surface motifs of Au NCs through the electrostatic interactions between TOA cations and the negatively-charged carboxylic groups of GSH ligands (Figure 5c).[201] In another study, the luminescence of Au NCs has been further improved by spatially confining GSH-protected Au NCs in chitosan nanogel, using the electrostatic attractions between positively-charged amine groups of chitosan and negatively-charged carboxylic groups of the GSH ligands (Figure 5d).[202] Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a) Schematic illustration of ethanol-induced AIE of Au NCs. b) Digital photo of ethanol-induced AIE of Au NCs with different ethanol-to-water volume ratio (fe).

4.2 Optical Absorption
Ultrasmall Au NCs possess discrete electronic states and unique HOMOLUMO transitions, which are distinctly different from the continuous electronic state and strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties of their larger counterparts, Au nanoparticles (above 3 nm). The size and structure (kernel and staples) of Au NCs determine their electronic structures and optical absorptions. In addition, for ligand-protected Au NCs, ligands will also affect the optical absorption of the Au NCs, as ligands with different anchoring points or functional groups might affect the Au core (and the structure of Au NCs) through the covalent bonds.
The anchoring point of the ligands will affect the optical properties of ligand-protected Au NCs. For example, the UVvis absorption spectra of Au44(CCR)28 and Au36(CCR)24 are different from the absorption spectra of their thiolate counterparts (i.e., Au44(SR)28 and Au36(SR)24). In particular, the longest wavelength of the absorption peaks of Au36(SR)24 is located at 558 nm, and this peak is red-shifted to 640 nm in the absorption spectrum of Au36(CCR)24 (Figure 6a,b).[99] This data suggests that the different coordination behavior of alkynyls and thiols will affect the optical properties of Au NCs, even though they have the same size. Theoretical calculations suggest that the alkynyls can actively participate in the frontier orbitals of the whole cluster, however, this effect is absent in the case of thiolate ligands.[127] Similar observations have been reported in Au NCs protected by other ligands. For example, the absorption peaks of Au23(SR)16 are located at 570 and 460 nm, which are red-shifted to 600 and 490 nm, respectively, in the case of Au23(SePh)16. Similarly, in the case of ligand-protected Au25 NCs, the absorption peaks are red-shifted from 380, 450, and 670 nm (for Au25(SR)18) to 425, 500, and 720 nm (for Au25(SePh)18), respectively (Figure 6c).[203] Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a,b) UVvis absorption spectra of alkynyl- and thiolate-protected Au NCs with the same size.

Apart from the coordination atoms, functional groups on the ligands will also affect the optical properties of Au NCs. For example, we observed unexpected absorption peaks when thiolate-protected Au25 NCs were capped by negatively-charged thiolate ligands together with several positively- or neutrally-charged ones (Figure 6df).[204] The surface engineering of Au NCs may provide an efficient way to fine-tune the optical properties of ligand-protected Au NCs.
4.3 Stability
It is very obvious that the protecting ligands on the Au NC surface are crucial for the stability of ligand-protected Au NCs in solution, as the ligands can inhibit the oxidative-etching of the Au NCs, as well as prevent their aggregation in solution. The anchoring point(s), ligand body, and functional group(s) of the protecting ligands are all important considerations in improving the stability of Au NCs. In particular, the anchoring point of the ligands can form a strong covalent bond with the Au atoms on NC surface, while the ligand body and the functional group(s) of the ligands feature the molecular physics and ionic forces between the ligands on the NC surface, which can be used to further improve the stability of Au NCs in solution.
The covalent bonds formed by the anchoring point of the ligands and the Au atoms on the NC surface are the key for their good stability in solution. Compared with sulfur (S), the electronegativity and atomic radius of selenium (Se) are closer to that of gold, resulting in a stronger affinity of AuSe bond than the AuS bond.[205] As a result, selenolate-protected Au NCs showed enhanced stability in solution compared to their thiolate-protected analogues. For example, a time-dependent study on the UVvis absorption spectra of [Au25(SC8H17)18] and [Au25(SeC8H17)18] suggests that the absorption peaks of the [Au25(SC8H17)18] gradually disappeared during the incubation, while the absorption peaks of [Au25(SeC8H17)18] were preserved for a certain time period (Figure 7a).[205] Another study compared the solution stability of Au25 NCs protected by NHCs, thiolates, and phosphines, where the as-synthesized Au25 NCs were incubating in 1,2-dichloroethane at 80 C for 12 h. The UVvis absorption spectra of the Au NC samples (Figure 7be) suggest much better stability of NHC-protected Au NCs compared to Au25 NCs protected by thiolates and phosphines.[124] The good stability of NHC-protected Au NCs can be attributed to the stronger Au-carbene bond than Au-phosphine bond (0.9 eV increase in bonding strength)[109] and Au-thiolate bond (25 kJ mol1 increase in bonding energy).[206] Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a) Time-dependent UVvis absorption spectra of [Au25(SC8H17)18] and [Au25(SeC8H17)18] in toluene (incubated at 60 C).

Besides the anchoring point of the ligands, the ligand body and the functional groups of the ligands can also affect the stability of the ligand-protected Au NCs in solution. For example, compared with Au18 NCs protected by S-c-C6H11, Au18 NCs protected by GSH showed better stability due to the good encapsulation provided by GSH through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between ligands (the interaction between H-donor (OH and NH) and H-acceptor (CO)).[207] Moreover, our group found that the electrostatic attractions between the oppositely-charged functional groups of the neighboring ligands on the Au NC surface can improve the stability of Au NCs in solution, because these electrostatic attractions might induce the formation of a pseudo-cage-like structure on the NC surface, providing better protection to the Au core in the aqueous solution.[36] Similarly, we also found that Au25 NCs protected by mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), showed better stability than Au25 NCs protected by mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), as MHA has a longer chain length and stronger hydrophobic interactions between the ligands, thus providing better protection to the Au NCs in solution.[36]
4.4 Chemical Reactivity
Unlike bulk gold (the most noble metal), which is extremely inert to the external environment, ultrasmall Au NCs (less than 2 nm) are very active in diverse chemical reactions, such as oxidation,[30, 208] hydrogenation,[30, 40] and coupling.[209, 210] The discrete redox behavior and the electronic structure contribute to the chemical reactivity of Au NCs. Currently, the active sites of Au NCs are proposed as unoccupied Au atoms on the core or Au(I) atoms on the motif shell.[211, 212] The ligand layer on Au NC surface might have a negative effect on their catalysis, as these ligands can block some active sites of Au NCs.[213] However, recent studies also showed that a delicate design of the ligands on the Au NC surface might also contribute to their catalysis, which can be readily used to design ligand-protected Au NCs with improved selectivity and activity. The three parts (anchoring point, ligand body, and functional groups) of ligands will also affect the chemical reactivity of ligand-protected Au NCs.
The anchoring point of the ligands can influence the NCs chemical reactivity, as it will affect the electronic and geometric structures of the Au NCs via different coordination chemistry. For example, compared to Au38 NCs protected by thiolates, Au38 NCs protected by alkynyls showed higher activity toward the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes. The improved reactivity of alkynyl-protected Au NCs can be attributed to the triple bond character of the alkynes, which favors the electronic mixing with the kernel atoms of Au NCs, providing a more suitable electronic structure for the activation of H2.[214] Different motif structures (e.g., staple and ring-like thiolate motifs) composed of anchoring points and Au(I) atoms also play a key role in tailoring the chemical reactivity of Au NCs. This geometric structure will directly determine the accessibility of the molecules to the related active sites and the adsorption/desorption process, resulting in different activity and selectivity. The ligand-induced isomers Au28(TBBT)20 and Au28(CHT)20 exhibit Au20 kernels with the same face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure, but they are protected by different motifs (dimeric and trimeric staples, respectively). Interestingly, Au28(TBBT)20 showed a higher catalytic activity for the oxidation of cyclo-hexane and benzyl alcohol,[215] while Au28(CHT)20 has a better catalytic reactivity for the oxidation of CO.[64] The different results indicate that the trimeric staples of Au28(CHT)20 may be the active sites for CO oxidation, while the dimeric staples of Au28(TBBT)20 may be the active sites for organic oxidation.[211] In addition, the geometry of the active sites of Au NCs related to the anchoring points can also affect the chemical reactivity of Au NCs. It has been found that the high reactivity and selectivity of spherical Au25(SC2H4Ph)18 and rod-shaped Au25(PPh3)10(CCPh)5X2 (XBr and Cl) for the semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes to alkenes are highly related to the open triangular Au3 facet on Au25(SC2H4Ph)18 and the waist sites on Au25(PPh3)10(CCPh)5X2.[212] In addition, spherical Au25 NCs have better activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction than rod-shaped Au25 NC, which can also be attributed to the exposure of high-energy active sites.[216] The ligand body will also affect the chemical reactivity of Au NCs. For example, Au25 NCs protected by different thiolate ligands, including SC6H13, SC2H4Ph, SPh, and Snap, have been prepared and deposited on CeO2, and their catalytic activities in a hetero-coupling between 4-methyl-iodobenzene and 4-nitro-iodobenzene have been compared.[209] The Au NCs protected by the aromatic thiolate ligands showed higher activity and selectivity, as the aromatic ligands provide better activation of the carboniodine bond compared to the aliphatic ones (Figure 8a).[209] Apart from the activation effects, the possible ππ interactions between the aromatic ligands and reactants can also improve the catalytic activities of Au NCs. For example, in the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol, the ππ interactions between the benzene rings of the surface ligands and 4-nitrophenol (the reactants) have facilitated the diffusion of the reactants into the ligand shell of Au NCs, providing better access to the active sites on the NC surface with an optimal orientation of the reactants (a perpendicular orientation) (Figure 8e).[40] However, a different trend was observed in CO oxidation catalyzed by Au NCs, where the aromatic ligands decreased the activity of Au NCs. The possible reason is that the active sites of Au NCs for CO oxidation are the perimeter sites of the interface between the Au NCs and the supports,[217] and the aromatic ligands on Au NC surface increase the steric hindrance at the interface which has inhibited the CO adsorption for catalytic reactions.[190] This study also points out that the steric hindrance on the AuS interface will influence the catalytic performance (Figure 8b,c).[218] The above examples suggest that the effects of benzene ring (of the surface ligands) on the catalytic reactions are highly related to the targeted catalytic reactions. As for the thiolate ligands with alkyl chains, the longer chain will reduce the accessibility and reactivity of Au NCs for catalytic reactions (Figure 8d).[40] Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a) Effects of aromatic ligands on the activity and selectivity of Au NCs for the Ullmann hetero-coupling reaction.

The functional groups of the surface ligands of Au NCs can also affect the chemical reactivity of Au NCs. For example, we have compared the accessibility and activity of Au25(SR)18 protected by ligands with carboxylic and amine groups, in the 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation reaction, and found that the existence of amine groups would decrease the chemical reactivity of Au25(SR)18 due to the combined steric hindrance and electronic modification to the gold core (Figure 8e,f).[40] Besides the four physicochemical properties discussed above (i.e., photoluminescence, optical absorption, stability in solution, and chemical reactivity), the ligands of Au NCs will also affect many other properties, such as biological properties, which are crucial to engineering ligand-protected Au NCs for biomedical applications.[148] Interested readers can refer to recent reviews on this topic.[148] Using a certain biocompatible ligand, such as biomolecules (e.g., peptides[43, 219] and proteins[141, 220]) and hydrophilic thiolate ligands,[44, 221] has been proved as a promising strategy to fabricate biocompatible metal NCs, finding increasing acceptance in diverse biomedical applications. 5 Conclusion In this review, we discussed the effects of ligands on the synthesis, structures, and properties of ligand-protected Au NCs. The underlying chemistry and design principles revealed in the Au NCs will also be applicable to other noble metal NCs, such as Ag NCs.
For ligand-protected Au NC synthesis, the design of the ligands is pivotal to developing efficient synthetic strategies to produce atomically precise Au NCs with well-defined sizes and structures. The choice of the ligand is a key consideration in the synthesis of hydrophobic-ligand-protected Au NCs, typically via size-focusing, LEIST, or ligand-exchange method. The same is also valid for those hydrophilic-ligand-protected Au NCs, where a one-pot synthesis method, such as CO-reduction and NaOH-mediated NaBH4-reduction method, has been widely used to produce Au NCs in water; and a delicate design of water-soluble ligands is the prerequisite toward the successful synthesis of high-quality Au NCs in water.
Moreover, the ligands on the NC surface can affect the structures of Au NCs, including their kernel and staple structures. More interestingly, the ligands on Au NC surface will also affect the molecular chirality of ligand-protected Au NCs. Therefore, ligands can determine the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs. For example, a selection of ligands with more electron donating atoms (or groups) can improve the charge-transfer between the ligands and the metallic core, thus enhancing the luminescence of Au NCs; and a design of ligand surface layer with stronger molecular physics forces can provide a better protection to Au NCs, improving their stability in solution, as well as in the practical set-ups.
The following challenging issues should be addressed in ligand design of Au NCs. First, to date, the synthesis of Au NCs protected by mono-ligands has been well developed. However, the same cannot be said for bi-ligand-protected Au NCs, especially for those with precise control of the ligand composition at the molecular level. Bi-ligand-protected Au NCs can significantly diversify the surface properties of Au NCs in various applications. The precise ligand control on the surface of Au NCs represents a forefront research topic in the surface engineering of functional nanomaterials, which requires the joint efforts of multidisciplinary research communities in the near future.
Second, the latest progress in the synthetic chemistry of ligand-protected Au NCs has established a rich library of Au NCs protected by different types of ligands, whose size, composition, and structure are well controlled. However, the surface functionalities of Au NCs are rather limited. For example, most of the surface functional groups of hydrophilic Au NCs are carboxylic group (COOH), which only provides good solubility for Au NCs in water. Hydrophilic ligands carrying other functional groups (e.g., amine and hydroxyl) can be used to produce Au NCs with desirable surface properties, which will be promising for diverse solution-based applications. In addition, besides providing good protection for Au NCs, a delicate design of surface ligand may also play other important roles, such as enhancing the physicochemical properties of Au NCs or providing reactivity for Au NCs in various applications. Therefore, the use of multifunctional ligands to produce Au NCs may also offer good opportunities to further diversify their physicochemical properties and application performance.
Last but not the least, there are a number of reports on the effects of ligands on the properties of Au NCs. However, systematic and in-depth research is still needed to further correlate the properties of ligands with the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs. For example, designing Au NCs to absorb/emit specific wavelengths for bioimaging application is still a challenge. The mechanism and active sites of Au NCs in catalytic applications are still elusive. The systematic study of the influence of ligands on the physical and chemical properties of Au NCs will shed fundamental lights on the design principles of surface ligands of Au NCs, and will eventually pave the way of Au NCs for their diverse applications.
