Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by changing the size and morphology of metal particles, which are closely related to their catalytic activity. This is because the performance of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis is influenced by their interactions with the oxide support. For example, flat metal deposits have been found to be more active in certain reactions, such as low-temperature CO oxidation over bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films, Au/FeOx catalysts, and propanol oxidation over alumina-supported Pt. The particle perimeter plays a specific role in enabling simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support, which explains the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis. Attempts have been made to tailor the shape of metal deposits on oxide supports, but most approaches are restricted to specific oxide systems and unsuitable for optimizing particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides used in heterogeneous catalysis. This work demonstrates how doping of an oxide material can be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles. By preparing CaO films with defined quantities of Li and/or Mo dopants, the authors were able to observe changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films, which can be explained by charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state and can transfer an electron to the Au 6s affinity level, resulting in the growth of 2D metal islands stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions. In contrast, Li is a charge acceptor that creates energetically costive holes in the 2p orbitals of adjacent O ions, which can be filled by electrons from the Mo codopants, triggering charge-compensation effects between the dopants and reducing the number of electrons available for transfer into the Au deposits. The absence of excess electrons forces the gold to adopt its original 3D growth regime. The geometry crossover affects primarily particles along the CaO dislocation lines, suggesting that the line defects are the preferred binding sites of Li. The study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support and illustrates that codoping results in internal charge compensation that destroys the desired effect.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify the surface chemistry by turning the surface into a Lewis acid or base, which strongly influences the dissociation of halogens. For instance, La-doped CeO2 becomes a Lewis acid, causing halogen atoms to bind more strongly to the oxygen site as a base. Conversely, Ta-doped ceria becomes a Lewis base, leading halogen atoms to bind more strongly to the cerium site as an acid. These changes in bonding can enhance catalytic activity, alter the nature and location of active centers, and potentially improve industrially relevant reactions.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by turning the oxide surface into a Lewis acid when a lower-valence cation replaces the host oxide's cation. This substitution creates an electron deficit, making the doped surface a Lewis acid. Doping increases the oxide's ability to accept electrons, making it a stronger acid. As a result, a base binds more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the undoped one. This effect is observed in both reducible and irreducible oxides. In reducible oxides, the cations can be reduced in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides, the base always fills the hole created by the LVD. These changes in surface chemistry and chemical bonding can enhance catalytic activity, alter the nature and location of active centers, and potentially improve industrially relevant reactions.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is hoped to favorably modify the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers resulting from this process could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself, potentially leading to improvements in industrially relevant reactions.
