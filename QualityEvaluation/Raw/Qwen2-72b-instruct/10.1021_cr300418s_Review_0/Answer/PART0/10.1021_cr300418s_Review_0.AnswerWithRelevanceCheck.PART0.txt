          [1] "Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications. (1-7) In addition, oxides catalyze many important reactions whose conversion or selectivity is too low to be commercially interesting."
          [2] "We review here experiments and calculations whose goal was to improve the catalytic activity of an oxide by substituting a small fraction of the cations of a host oxide with a different cation. We call this substitutional doping or doping."
          [3] "The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will modify favorably its catalytic activity."
          [4] "The active centers in such a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is hoped to favorably modify the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers resulting from this process could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself, potentially leading to improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

          在金属氧化物催化剂中，替代性阳离子掺杂通过破坏宿主氧化物表面的化学键来改变表面化学。人们希望这种破坏能有利地改变氧化物的催化活性。在这种体系中，活性中心可能是靠近掺杂剂的氧原子或掺杂剂本身，这可能导致工业相关反应的改进。
