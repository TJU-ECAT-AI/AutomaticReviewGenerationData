{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity. Doping changes metal particle size and morphology, crucial for catalytic performance due to interactions with oxide supports. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au rafts on titania, Au/FeOx catalysts, and Pt on alumina for propanol oxidation, show enhanced activity. Particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining shape-dependence in catalysis. Shaping metal deposits on oxides is challenging on conventional bulk oxides. This study demonstrates control of metal ad-particle shape via oxide doping. Mo dopants in CaO films lead to 2D Au island growth, stabilized by electron transfer from Mo to Au. Li doping, creating O 2p holes, blocks this electron transfer, forcing Au to adopt 3D growth.
