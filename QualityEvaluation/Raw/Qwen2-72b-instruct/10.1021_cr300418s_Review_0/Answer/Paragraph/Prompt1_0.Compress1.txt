{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity by altering metal particle size and morphology. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au rafts on titania, Au/FeOx, and Pt on alumina, show enhanced reactivity in CO oxidation and propanol oxidation. Particle perimeter interactions with the oxide support and metal are crucial for catalytic performance. Doping CaO films with Mo or Li changes Au particle geometry, with Mo promoting 2D growth due to electron transfer to Au, stabilizing anionic gold with strong metal-oxide adhesion. Li doping blocks this charge exchange, forcing Au to adopt 3D growth by reducing available electrons.
