{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity. Metal particle size, morphology, and interactions with the oxide support are crucial for catalytic performance. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au rafts on titania, Au/FeOx catalysts, and Pt on alumina, show enhanced activity in reactions such as CO oxidation and propanol oxidation. The particle perimeter enables simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support, explaining the shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis. Doping can control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles, as demonstrated by changes in Au particle geometry on doped CaO films. Mo dopants in CaO adopt a +2 charge state, transferring an electron to Au, resulting in 2D metal islands. Li dopants create holes in adjacent O ions, reducing electron transfer to Au and forcing a 3D growth regime. The study reveals how doping can tailor metal ad-particle shapes and highlights the internal charge compensation effect of codoping.", "Doi": "10.1021/ja211396"},

These changes improve catalytic activity and redefine active centers, potentially boosting industrially relevant reactions.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp211693v"},
{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxides transforms surfaces into Lewis acids, enhancing catalytic performance. By replacing a host oxide's cation with a lower-valence dopant, an electron deficit is created, turning the surface into a Lewis acid (Quote 2). This substitution increases the oxide's electron acceptance ability, making it a stronger acid (Quote 4). Consequently, bases bind more strongly to doped surfaces than to undoped ones (Quote 5). This effect is consistent across reducible and irreducible oxides (Quote 6). In reducible oxides, cations can be reduced in the presence of a base, adding complexity to the charge exchange mechanism (Quote 7). Irreducible oxides, however, have bases that always fill the hole created by the dopant (Quote 12).

Metal particles' performance in heterogeneous catalysis is influenced by their interactions with the oxide support, with flat deposits showing enhanced activity in reactions like low-temperature CO oxidation over Au rafts on titania and propanol oxidation over Pt on alumina. The particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining shape-dependence in catalysis. Attempts to tailor metal deposit shapes are often limited to specific oxide systems. This study demonstrates shaping metal ad-particles via doping oxide supports with Li and Mo. Mo-doped CaO films lead to 2D Au island growth due to electron transfer from Mo to Au, stabilizing the islands. Li doping, as a charge acceptor, creates holes filled by Mo electrons, blocking charge transfer and forcing Au to adopt its original 3D growth. The geometry crossover primarily affects particles along CaO dislocation lines, indicating Li's preferred binding sites.
