Enhancing catalytic performance through substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for modifying surface chemistry and disrupting chemical bonding, with significant implications for active centers and industrially relevant reactions. Doping can alter metal particle size and morphology, which are critical for catalytic performance, as demonstrated by the enhanced activity of flat metal deposits in reactions such as CO oxidation and propanol oxidation \[10.1021/ja211396\]. The particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining the shape-dependence in catalysis. Mo dopants in CaO films lead to 2D Au island growth via electron transfer, stabilizing metal-oxide adhesion, while Li doping blocks this charge exchange, reducing electrons for Au, forcing 3D growth \[10.1021/ja211396\]. These findings reveal how doping can shape metal ad-particles and highlight the internal charge compensation effect of codoping.

Doping can also transform metal oxide surfaces into Lewis acids or bases, enhancing halogen dissociation and catalytic activity. La-doped CeO2 acts as a Lewis acid, strengthening halogen binding to oxygen sites, while Ta-doped ceria, as a Lewis base, intensifies halogen binding to cerium sites \[10.1021/jp211693v\]. These changes improve catalytic activity and alter active centers, potentially boosting industrial reactions.

Moreover, substitutional cation doping creates an electron deficit when lower-valence cations replace host cations, enhancing the oxide's electron-accepting ability and making it a stronger acid \[10.1021/jp301341\]. This increases the oxide's electron acceptance ability, leading to stronger base binding on doped surfaces compared to undoped ones. In reducible oxides, cations can reduce in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides, the base fills the hole created by the dopant. These modifications can alter active centers and improve industrial reactions.

The disruption of surface chemical bonding by substitutional cation doping potentially enhances catalytic activity, with active centers forming near the dopant or involving the dopant itself \[10.1021/cr300418s\_0\]. This approach could lead to improvements in industrially relevant reactions by favorably altering the oxide's catalytic properties.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel doping strategies that can precisely control the shape and size of metal ad-particles on oxide supports, potentially leading to the discovery of new active centers and enhanced catalytic performance. The exploration of codoping effects and the internal charge compensation mechanisms could provide insights into the optimization of catalytic activity and the design of more efficient catalysts for industrially relevant reactions. Additionally, the investigation of how doping can transform metal oxide surfaces into Lewis acids or bases, and the subsequent impact on halogen dissociation and catalytic activity, opens up new avenues for the improvement of industrial processes. The integration of computational modeling and experimental techniques could further elucidate the complex interplay between surface chemistry modifications and catalytic activity, guiding the rational design of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other industrially significant reactions.

Catalysis by Doped Oxides

SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the 2013 Surface Chemistry of Oxides special issue.
1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications. (1-7) In addition, oxides catalyze many important reactions whose conversion or selectivity is too low to be commercially interesting. We review here experiments and calculations whose goal was to improve the catalytic activity of an oxide by substituting a small fraction of the cations of a “host oxide” with a different cation. We call this substitutional doping or doping. The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will modify favorably its catalytic activity. The active centers in such a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself.
This is not the only kind of “creative disturbance” that can activate the surface of an oxide. The catalytic activity of a small (molecular size) cluster MeOx (where Me is a cation, O is oxygen, and x is usually unknown) supported on the surface of another oxide (or any other insulator) is often very different from that of the bulk oxide of Me. For example, VOx clusters supported on ceria (8, 9) are more active for methanol oxidation (and many other reactions) than either V2O5 or CeO2. The so-called “inverse catalysts” are similar. They consist of a very thin oxide film supported on a metal surface. (10-30) In this system, as in the other two mentioned above, we place the oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations with the intention of improving their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions.
Substitutional cation doping is not the only possibility. One can imagine that replacing some anions with other anions may also be beneficial. There is evidence that the presence of small amounts of halogen in the feed or on the oxide surface improves its catalytic activity (more often the selectivity). (31-53) We do not know of any work that has proven that the improvements come from the substitution of some of the oxygen atoms with halogens. Anion doping is beneficial for changing the optical properties of photocatalysts as reviewed recently by Kudo. (54)
In this Review, we discuss only oxidation catalysis by substitutional cation doping of binary oxides (oxides with the formula MexOy), and leave out complex oxides (e.g., perovskites, vanadates). This is an emerging field, which is rapidly evolving and is very far from maturity; therefore, it is not advisable to attempt the kind of exhaustive review typical of mature fields. Instead, we concentrate on the main ideas and the major difficulties of the field, try to sort out its prospects, suggest future lines of research, and examine the extent to which computations aid the search for better doped-oxide catalysts. Rather than attempt to cover all work on catalysis by doped oxides, which is rather vast and fragmentary, we examine in some depth a few examples on which data are more abundant and the research is more extensive and more systematic. One example deals with the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene, by using oxygen or CO2 as oxidant. The other example examines the ODH of ethane with oxygen. We decided that piling up more examples would not bring more clarity to our understanding of the subject. This decision was made easier by our awareness of the finite nature of our time, energy, and intellectual resources.
We note that we present scientific research rather than focus on efforts directed toward finding the best commercial catalyst. This means that some aspects that are essential for deciding whether a catalyst is commercially promising are not addressed in this article. An excellent discussion of the criteria that a commercial catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation must meet can be found in Chapter 5 of the book by Centi, Cavani, and Trifiro. (7)
As we worked on this article, several themes became central. On the experimental side two facts imposed themselves on us: The performance depends strongly on the method of preparation; and it is difficult to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared. For this reason, we devoted a section to the methods of preparation and one to the methods of characterization.
There has been considerable computational work on various properties of doped oxides. There are inherent limitations in this work. First, we know that the computational methods usable in practice do not give accurate total energies. Second, we do not know, at the atomic level, the morphology or the composition of an oxide catalyst under working conditions. The latter is a shortcoming of the experiments. We could perform useful calculations on any morphology or any surface composition, if we knew what they are. Unfortunately, experiments are not likely to provide this information soon, despite the great progress made lately in operando microscopy and spectroscopy. For these reasons, we believe that computations are most useful, at this time, if they look for qualitative trends and qualitative rules for catalyst design. They should help increase the probability of finding better oxide catalysts. This opinion has guided the way we examined the computations and organized the presentation of their results. The calculations performed so far provide a classification of the dopant&ndash;oxide pairs based on the common properties obtained by computations. One of the questions we ask in this Review is: Are there hints in the experiments that these rules are obeyed? Given the uncertainties in the experiments, we can only say that many experimental results are in accord with the qualitative suggestions made by computations.
