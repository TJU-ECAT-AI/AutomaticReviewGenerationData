The strategic incorporation of substitutional cations into metal oxide catalysts significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic performance \[10.1021/ja211396\]. This is achieved by controlling the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles, as demonstrated by the changes in Au particle geometry on doped CaO films \[10.1021/ja211396\]. Mo dopants in CaO adopt a +2 charge state, transferring an electron to Au, resulting in the stabilization of 2D metal islands. Conversely, Li dopants create holes in adjacent O ions, reducing electron transfer to Au and forcing a 3D growth regime \[10.1021/ja211396\]. These modifications in surface chemistry and chemical bonding can lead to the formation of active centers near the dopant or involving the dopant itself, potentially improving industrially relevant reactions \[10.1021/cr300418s\_0\].

                Substitutional cation doping also transforms metal oxides into Lewis acids or bases, enhancing catalytic activity. La-doped CeO2 acts as a Lewis acid, strengthening halogen binding to oxygen sites, while Ta-doped ceria becomes a Lewis base, intensifying halogen binding to cerium sites \[10.1021/jp211693v\]. These changes in surface chemistry improve catalytic activity and redefine active centers, potentially boosting industrially relevant reactions \[10.1021/jp211693v\].

                By replacing a host oxide's cation with a lower-valence dopant, an electron deficit is created, turning the surface into a Lewis acid. This substitution increases the oxide's electron acceptance ability, making it a stronger acid \[10.1021/jp301341\]. Consequently, bases bind more strongly to doped surfaces than to undoped ones, affecting catalytic performance and active center characteristics \[10.1021/jp301341\].

                These findings underscore the potential of substitutional cation doping to enhance the catalytic performance of metal oxide catalysts through the modification of surface chemistry and the disruption of chemical bonding, leading to the formation of active centers near the dopant or involving the dopant itself \[10.1021/cr300418s\_0\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights gained from the study of substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts reveal a promising avenue for the enhancement of catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions. By tailoring the surface chemistry and controlling the chemical bonding through strategic doping, it becomes possible to engineer active centers that are more efficient and selective. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel doping strategies that can further refine the control over metal ad-particle shapes and the nature of active centers. Additionally, the exploration of codoping effects and the internal charge compensation mechanisms could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with enhanced stability and activity. The integration of computational modeling with experimental studies could also provide deeper insights into the complex interplay between surface chemistry modifications and catalytic activity, guiding the design of next-generation catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other industrially significant reactions.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
The strategic incorporation of dopants into metal oxide catalysts has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance catalytic performance, a topic of paramount importance in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Substitutional cation doping, in particular, has been shown to significantly alter the electronic structure and surface chemistry of metal oxides, thereby influencing the nature and activity of catalytic centers. This section will delve into the mechanisms underlying the effects of cation doping, the modifications to surface chemistry, and the implications for the active centers in metal oxide catalysts.

Mechanistically, the introduction of dopants into the lattice of metal oxides can lead to a redistribution of charge, creating localized regions of higher or lower electron density. This charge modulation can enhance the reactivity of the surface by facilitating the adsorption and activation of reactants. For instance, the doping of TiO2 with Nb has been shown to create localized states within the bandgap, which act as electron traps and promote the reduction of CO2 to CO under visible light illumination (1). These localized states can also act as active sites for redox reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic activity.

Surface chemistry modifications resulting from cation doping are equally critical in determining the catalytic activity. Dopants can alter the surface acidity, basicity, and hydrophilicity, which are key factors in the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. For example, the doping of ZrO2 with Ce has been found to increase the surface basicity, enhancing the adsorption of acidic reactants and improving the catalytic performance in the water-gas shift reaction (2). Moreover, dopants can also influence the surface morphology and phase stability of metal oxides, which can further impact the catalytic activity.

The implications of cation doping for active centers in metal oxide catalysts are multifaceted. Dopants can either create new active sites or modify existing ones, leading to changes in the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. The nature of the dopant and its interaction with the host lattice are crucial in determining the type of active centers formed. For instance, the doping of CuO with Zn has been shown to create ZnO-CuO heterojunctions, which act as active sites for the selective reduction of NOx to N2 (3). These heterojunctions provide a synergistic effect, where the ZnO component stabilizes the CuO phase, preventing its reduction and maintaining its catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the substitutional cation doping of metal oxide catalysts is a promising strategy to enhance catalytic performance. The mechanisms by which dopants influence the electronic structure and surface chemistry of metal oxides, as well as the implications for active centers, are complex and multifaceted. Further research is needed to fully understand the interplay between dopant type, concentration, and the resulting changes in catalytic activity, which will ultimately guide the rational design of more efficient and selective metal oxide catalysts.
