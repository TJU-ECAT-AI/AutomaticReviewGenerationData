{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity. Metal particle size and morphology, influenced by interactions with the oxide support, are crucial for catalysis. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au on titania, Au/FeOx, and Pt on alumina, show enhanced activity in CO oxidation and propanol oxidation. Particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining shape-dependence in catalysis. Doping can tailor metal deposit shapes, overcoming limitations on conventional bulk oxides. Mo doping in CaO films leads to 2D Au island growth due to electron transfer from Mo to Au, stabilizing the anionic gold with strong metal-oxide adhesion. Li doping, creating charge acceptors, blocks this electron transfer, forcing Au to adopt its original 3D growth. The study reveals how oxide support doping can control metal ad-particle shapes, with implications for catalytic activity and active center locations.", "Doi": "10.1021/ja211396"},
{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry, enhancing catalytic activity. La-doped CeO2 acts as a Lewis acid, strengthening halogen binding to the oxygen site.

Consequently, bases bind more strongly to doped oxide surfaces than to undoped ones (46, 77, 86, 87). This effect is consistent across reducible and irreducible oxides, with the latter always filling the hole created by the low-valence dopant (LVD).
