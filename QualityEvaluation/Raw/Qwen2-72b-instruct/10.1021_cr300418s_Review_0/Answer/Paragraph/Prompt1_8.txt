{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity. Metal particle size and morphology, closely related to catalytic performance, are influenced by interactions with the oxide support. Flat metal deposits, such as bilayer Au rafts on titania for CO oxidation, Au/FeOx catalysts, and Pt on alumina for propanol oxidation, exhibit enhanced reactivity. Particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining shape-dependence in catalysis.
