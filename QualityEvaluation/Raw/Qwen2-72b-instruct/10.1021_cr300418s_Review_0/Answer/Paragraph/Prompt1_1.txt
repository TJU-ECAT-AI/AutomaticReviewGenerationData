{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity. Metal particle size, morphology, and interactions with oxide supports are crucial for catalytic performance. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au on titania, Au/FeOx, and Pt on alumina, show enhanced activity in CO oxidation and propanol oxidation. Particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining shape-dependence in catalysis. Doping can tailor metal deposit shapes, but conventional methods are limited. This study demonstrates control of Au particle shape on doped CaO films. Mo dopants lead to 2D Au island growth via electron transfer, stabilizing metal-oxide adhesion. Li doping blocks this charge exchange, reducing electrons for Au, forcing 3D growth. Geometry crossover affects particles along CaO dislocation lines, indicating Li's preferred binding sites.
