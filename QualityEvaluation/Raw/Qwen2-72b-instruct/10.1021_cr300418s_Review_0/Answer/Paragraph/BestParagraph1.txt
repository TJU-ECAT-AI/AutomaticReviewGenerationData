        Enhancing catalytic performance through substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for modifying surface chemistry and disrupting chemical bonding, with significant implications for active centers and industrially relevant reactions. Doping can alter metal particle size and morphology, which are critical for catalytic performance, as demonstrated by the enhanced activity of flat metal deposits in reactions such as CO oxidation and propanol oxidation \[10.1021/ja211396\]. The particle perimeter enables simultaneous adsorbate interaction with metal and oxide, explaining the shape-dependence in catalysis. Mo dopants in CaO films lead to 2D Au island growth via electron transfer, stabilizing metal-oxide adhesion, while Li doping blocks this charge exchange, reducing electrons for Au, forcing 3D growth \[10.1021/ja211396\]. These findings reveal how doping can shape metal ad-particles and highlight the internal charge compensation effect of codoping.

Doping can also transform metal oxide surfaces into Lewis acids or bases, enhancing halogen dissociation and catalytic activity. La-doped CeO2 acts as a Lewis acid, strengthening halogen binding to oxygen sites, while Ta-doped ceria, as a Lewis base, intensifies halogen binding to cerium sites \[10.1021/jp211693v\]. These changes improve catalytic activity and alter active centers, potentially boosting industrial reactions.

Moreover, substitutional cation doping creates an electron deficit when lower-valence cations replace host cations, enhancing the oxide's electron-accepting ability and making it a stronger acid \[10.1021/jp301341\]. This increases the oxide's electron acceptance ability, leading to stronger base binding on doped surfaces compared to undoped ones. In reducible oxides, cations can reduce in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides, the base fills the hole created by the dopant. These modifications can alter active centers and improve industrial reactions.

The disruption of surface chemical bonding by substitutional cation doping potentially enhances catalytic activity, with active centers forming near the dopant or involving the dopant itself \[10.1021/cr300418s_0\]. This approach could lead to improvements in industrially relevant reactions by favorably altering the oxide's catalytic properties.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel doping strategies that can precisely control the shape and size of metal ad-particles on oxide supports, potentially leading to the discovery of new active centers and enhanced catalytic performance. The exploration of codoping effects and the internal charge compensation mechanisms could provide insights into the optimization of catalytic activity and the design of more efficient catalysts for industrially relevant reactions. Additionally, the investigation of how doping can transform metal oxide surfaces into Lewis acids or bases, and the subsequent impact on halogen dissociation and catalytic activity, opens up new avenues for the improvement of industrial processes. The integration of computational modeling and experimental techniques could further elucidate the complex interplay between surface chemistry modifications and catalytic activity, guiding the rational design of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other industrially significant reactions.
