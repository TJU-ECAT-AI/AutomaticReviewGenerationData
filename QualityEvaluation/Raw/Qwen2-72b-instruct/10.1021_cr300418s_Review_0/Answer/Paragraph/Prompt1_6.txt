{"DOC": "Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, impacting catalytic activity by changing metal particle size, morphology, and interactions with oxide supports. Flat metal deposits, like bilayer Au rafts on titania for CO oxidation, Au/FeOx catalysts, and Pt on alumina for propanol oxidation, are more active due to the role of the particle perimeter in enabling adsorbate interaction. Attempts to tailor metal deposit shapes are limited, but doping can control particle geometry. Doped CaO films with Mo or Li alter Au particle geometry through charge-transfer processes. Mo impurities in CaO can transfer an electron to Au, stabilizing 2D metal islands, while Li creates holes filled by Mo electrons, reducing Au electron transfer and forcing 3D growth. This study demonstrates shaping metal ad-particles via oxide support doping, revealing that codoping can result in internal charge compensation, negating the desired effect.", "Doi": "10.1021/ja211396"},

This substitution increases the oxide's electron acceptance ability, making it a stronger acid (4). Consequently, bases bind more strongly to doped surfaces than to undoped ones (5). In reducible oxides, cations can be reduced in the presence of a base, introducing complexity to the charge exchange mechanism (7, 8). In contrast, bases in irreducible oxides always fill the hole created by the low-valence dopant (LVD) (12). These surface chemistry modifications can enhance catalytic activity and alter active centers, potentially improving industrial reactions.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp301341"},
