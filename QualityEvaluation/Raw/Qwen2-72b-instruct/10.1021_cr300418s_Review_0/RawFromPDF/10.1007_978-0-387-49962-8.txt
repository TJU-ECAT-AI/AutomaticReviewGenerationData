PREFACE TO THE SERIES 
Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in 
the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to 
fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or 
prohibitively expensive. There are few chemical- or oil-based material items in 
modern society that do not depend in some way on a catalytic stage in their 
manufacture. Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other 
important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of 
catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are 
certain to increase in the future. 
The commercial importance of catalysis and the diverse intellectual 
challenges of catalytic phenomena have stimulated study by a broad spectrum of 
scientists, including chemists, physicists, chemical engineers, and material 
scientists. Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels 
of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing 
amount of published material. As recently as sixty years ago, Rideal and Taylor 
could still treat the subject comprehensively in a single volume, but by the 
1950s. Emmett required six volumes, and no conventional multivolume text 
could now cover the whole of catalysis in any depth. In view of this situation, 
we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which 
would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis 
reference library. This is the aim of the present series, Fundamental and Applied 
Catalysis. 
Some books in the series deal with particular techniques used in the study 
of catalysts and catalysis: these cover the scientific basis of the technique, details 
of its practical applications, and examples of its usefulness. An industrial 
process or a class of catalysts forms the basis of other books, with information 
on the fundamental science of the topic, the use of the process or catalysts, and 
engineering aspects. Single topics in catalysis are also treated in the series, with 
books giving the theory of the underlying science, and relating it to catalytic 
practice. We believe that this approach provides a collection that is of value to 
both academic and industrial workers. The series editors welcome comments on 
the series and suggestions of topics for future volumes.

PREFACE 
since 1945, when oil began to replace coal as the most important industrial raw 
material. Even after working for more than 35 years with catalysts, I am still 
surprised to consider the present size of the catalyst business and to see how 
many specialist companies supply different operators. Now that each segment of 
the industry is so specialized no single organization is able to make all of the 
catalyst types that are required. The wide range of catalysts being used also 
means that it is difficult to keep pace with the details of every process involved. 
Unfortunately, there are few readily available comprehensive descriptions of 
individual industrial catalysts and how they are used. This is a pity, since 
catalysts play such an important part in everyday life. 
Modern catalyst use was unimaginable a hundred years ago because 
catalysts were still chemical curiosities. The use of catalytic processes simply 
increased with the demand for new products and gradual improvements in 
engineering technology. Only now is it becoming true to say that catalyst design, 
which originally relied on luck and the experience of individuals, is becoming a 
more exact science. New construction materials have made plant operation more 
efficient and led to the development of better processes and catalysts. It is no 
coincidence that the two major wars of the twentieth century saw the rapid 
expansion of a more sophisticated chemical industry. Currently, some new 
catalysts are evolving from previous experience while others are being 
specifically designed to satisfy new consumer demands. This is demonstrated by 
the introduction of catalysts to reduce automobile exhaust emissions in response 
to environmental regulations.  This has been one of the major catalyst growth 
areas of the past 20 years and the use of catalysts to control various industrial 
emissions is similarly important. 
The demand for catalysts is still increasing particularly in the Far East, as 
expansion of the chemical and refining industries keeps pace with the increase in 
world population. As a consequence, the number of catalyst suppliers is still 
growing. All have the experience needed to produce large volumes of catalysts 
successfully and can give good advice on process operation, but different 
catalysts for the same applications are not always identical. 
Ownership of key patents for catalysts and catalytic processes has led to 
licenses being offered by chemical and engineering companies. For this reason 
precise catalyst compositions are not often published, and while commercial 
products may seem to differ only in minor details, in a particularly efficient 
manufacturing process these can certainly improve performance. There are no 
catalyst recipe books, and details regarded as company secrets are hidden in the 
vague descriptions of a patent specification.  
The use of catalysts in chemical and refining processes has increased rapidly 
vii
Competition among suppliers in a market where customers may only place 
large orders every few years has encouraged overcapacity in order to meet 
emergency requirements. At the same time, low selling prices and the high costs 
of introducing new products have reduced profitability. The recent spate of 
catalyst joint ventures reflects this. 
Availability of reliable products must be guaranteed so that a customer’s 
expensive plant will not have to close down or operate at a loss. Security of 
supply is clearly a major factor in catalyst selection. Indeed, for many years it 
was a strategic or political necessity as well as being of commercial importance. 
For instance, during the ColdWar era, most of Eastern Europe and China had to 
rely on their own domestic production capacity. At the same time, the big 
chemical companies in the United States and Europe, which had traditionally 
produced their own catalysts, began to buy the best available commercial 
products. 
Since Sabatier published Catalysis in Organic Chemistry in 1918 many 
process reviews have been written on the industrial applications of catalysts and 
they provide a good deal of historical background. Lack of detail has meant, 
however, that catalyst compositions are not often included. In any case, earlier 
reviews are usually out of print and can only be found with difficulty from old 
library stock. Up-to-date information is badly needed. 
Catalysts could, by definition, operate continuously, but those used 
industrially may lose activity very quickly. Some catalysts can then be 
regenerated at regular intervals by burning of carbon deposited during operation. 
Others have to be replaced following permanent poisoning by impurities present 
in the reacting gases. To avoid the necessity for parallel reactors or unscheduled 
interruptions to replace spent catalyst, efficient operating procedures have had to 
be devised for online regeneration or the removal of poisons from feedstock. 
The use of additional catalysts or absorbents to protect the actual process 
catalysts has become an important feature of operation. Catalysts are also 
deactivated by overheating. This sinters either the active catalyst or the support 
and occurs if the operating temperature is at the limit of catalyst stability, 
particularly in the presence of trace impurities in feedstock. Other problems can 
result from increasing pressure drop through the catalyst bed, if dust is entrained 
with process gas or if the catalyst itself slowly disintegrates. 
It may therefore be necessary to replace catalysts many times during the life 
of plant equipment. Stability despite the presence of poisons becomes an 
important feature of the selection procedure to avoid unscheduled plant closures. 
Proper catalyst reduction may also be a critical step prior to operation to ensure 
optimum performance in the shortest possible time. This is not always easy and 
efforts have therefore been made to use prereduced catalysts and even to 
regenerate spent catalysts externally to restore as much of the original activity as 
possible. It should never be assumed that catalyst operation is straightforward. It

is often a nightmare. And effort spent in solving problems or making 
improvements is time consuming. The provision of an efficient technical service 
has thus become an indispensable element of the catalyst business. 
It is hoped that this extensive survey of industrial catalysis will stimulate a 
wider general interest in the subject. 
The author thanks J.R. Jennings, M. S. Spencer, and M.V. Twigg for much 
help in bringing this book to publication.

INDUSTRIAL CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
1.1. INTRODUCTION 
The first industrial catalyst was probably the niter pot, which was used in the 
early sulfuric acid lead chamber process when it became known that oxides of 
nitrogen catalyzed the oxidation of sulfur dioxide. How was this important pro-
cess—on which chemical development soon depended—discovered? Was it 
from the observation that cannons corroded or that condensation was acidic fol-
lowing the explosion of gunpowder? All the ingredients for chamber acid were 
there—sulfur, saltpeter, atmospheric air, and heat. Ostwald noted that “copious 
brown fumes” were evolved as gunpowder exploded, but did not make any 
comment on sulfur oxides.1 Empirical observations, or inspired deductions, dur-
ing the 1800s led to the introduction of several more important catalytic 
processes. The inevitable development of a chemical industry based on the use 
of catalysts followed from a mass of experimental observations, such as those 
shown in Table 1.1, accumulated after Berzelius2 defined catalysts in 1835 (Fig-
ure 1.1). 
Although the first catalyst was a gas, there are only a few homogeneous 
catalysts in use today. Most industrial catalysts are solids and operate heteroge-
neously in gas or liquid phase reactions. 
Most of the basic ideas of industrial catalysis gradually evolved during the 
early period of development. The use of particular groups of metals for hydro-
genation and oxidation reactions was investigated first in the laboratory and then 
industrially. Simple reactors with better control of operating conditions were

Chapter 1 
When using catalysts industrially it is important that the shape and size of 
the particles selected provide a proper balance between activity in the process 
and pressure drop through the reaction vessel. Thus, process design plays an 
important role in catalyst development. As catalysts are used and handled in 
increasingly large quantities, physical strength is one of the common factors in 
selecting any of the available shapes shown in Table 1.2.  
 
Some catalysts can now be regarded as mini-reactors and are designed that 
way. For example, the auto exhaust catalyst is supported on a monolith small 
enough to ﬁt underneath an automobile. On a molecular scale, metallocene 
compounds are  single-site catalysts that are now  being used to make  poly-
oleﬁns more selectively. It is probably not necessary to emphasize that the 
industrial catalysts used in chemical and reﬁning processes are not the same as 
the catalysts of theory. They all have well-deﬁned features related to the basic 
demands of the process in order to achieve predictable and economic operation. 
These are shown in Table 1.3.  
Catalyst manufacture is a specialized operation with producers working 
continuously to improve performance and quality. More than 90% of today’s 
chemical and reﬁning processes use catalysts. The world is dependent on cata-
lysts for food, fuel, plastics, synthetic ﬁbers, and many other everyday 
commodities, and there is no way that modern life would be the same if they 
were not available. Even so, operators have often ignored new reﬁnements in 
various catalytic processes and have continued with a relatively inactive catalyst

in an existing plant rather than spend money on new equipment. The advantages  
of a new process cannot be ignored indeﬁnitely, but the fact remains that many 
plants will operate at equilibrium with an out-of-date catalyst, and this can still 
be cost effective relative to additional capital expenditure. 
1.2. WHAT IS A CATALYST?  
It is usual to deﬁne a catalyst as a substance that increases the rate of a chemical 
reaction but is not consumed in the process. This deﬁnition must be qualiﬁed 
because a catalyst cannot change the thermodynamic equilibrium of a reaction 
during operation. Rather, the role of a catalyst in industry is to accelerate the rate 
of reaction toward chemical equilibrium in processes to improve the process 
economics.  
Industrial catalysts are often produced as oxides that may need activation 
before use. The principal catalytic components are intimately mixed with other 
components, usually by co-precipitation or impregnation from solution. The 
other components may act as promoters or supports. The role of the support may 
simply be to provide a porous framework on which the active materials are dis-
persed, but they also can have a key role in enhancing the lifetime of a catalyst, 
either by preventing loss of active surface area due to sintering or by absorbing 
traces of poisons. Many catalysts such as the platinum gauzes for nitric oxide 
production and Raney nickel, however, are already in the metallic form when 
supplied.  
The metal oxide catalysts used for hydrogenation reactions are reduced to 
an active form of the metal before use. Apart from metallic platinum and silver, 
which are used to oxidize ammonia and methanol, respectively, oxidation cata-
lysts are usually transition metal oxides. Acidic oxides, such as alumina, silica 
alumina, and zeolites are used in cracking, isomerization, and dehydrogenation 
reactions. These are only a few examples of the catalysts now being widely 
used. A more detailed list is given in Table 1.4.

1.2.1.  Activity  
 
Catalyst activity may be regarded practically as the rate at which the reaction 
proceeds on the catalyst volume charged to a reactor. The turnover number, or 
frequency, is the number of molecules of product produced by each active site 
per unit time under standard conditions. Because it is not practicable to calculate 
the active sites on a commercial catalyst, it is easier to measure the space-time 
yield (the quantity of product produced per unit volume of catalyst per unit time) 
during industrial operations. The space-time yield, or activity of a catalyst, de-
termines the reactor size for a particular process. The ratio of volumetric gas 
ﬂow per hour to catalyst volume under the design conditions chosen is known as 
the space velocity through the catalyst bed.

1.2.2.  Selectivity and Yield  
 
The conversion of reactants to products and by-products during a chemical pro-
cess is easily determined from the mass balance. The selectivity of a reaction is 
deﬁned as the proportion of useful product obtained from the amount feedstock 
converted. Thus it is possible to obtain almost 100% selectivity and still have an 
uneconomic process if the conversion is very low. Many processes operate at 
less than 100% conversion to limit heat evolution, to achieve higher selectivity 
or because of thermodynamic limitations. In these instances, the unconverted 
feed must be recycled and conversion per pass can still be relatively low, but 
economic. The key parameter in these instances is the yield of the reaction, 
which is the conversion multiplied by selectivity.  
An important advantage of using catalysts for any reaction is that the milder 
operating conditions give better selectivity. Low-selectivity catalysts are uneco-
nomic, not only because feed is wasted and by-products have to be separated 
from products, but also because side reactions are often more exothermic and 
complicate reactor design. Although the formation of by-products must, in gen-
eral, be prevented there are many examples of by-product sales becoming an 
important source of income. Often, when more efﬁcient processes were devel-
oped, it was commercially attractive to introduce a process for making the by-
product.  
 
1.2.3.  Stability  
 
It is normal for catalysts to lose some activity and selectivity over their opera-
tional lifetime before ﬁnally needing replacement. However, certain aspects of 
maloperation can cause premature damage to a catalyst, leading to premature 
replacement. This is possible when:  
• The catalyst is overheated and surface area decreases. 
• A volatile component is lost at high operating temperature. 
• Poisons in the feed deactivate the catalyst.  
• The catalyst is overheated and active sites coalesce. 
Catalysts often have short lives for any of these reasons and efforts must be 
made to obtain a more stable alternative or to prevent deactivation by modifying 
operation. 
The performance of most catalysts can deteriorate during relatively short 
periods of maloperation, so the expected performance should be checked at reg-
ular intervals. By recording operating details such as feed and efﬂuent 
composition and temperature proﬁles in the catalyst bed it is possible to assess 
abnormal operating features or feed purity. Appropriate adjustments can then be 
made. Some catalysts can be regenerated in situ while activity can be restored in 
others by identifying temporary poisons in the feed.  
8 
Chapter 1 
1.2.4. Strength  
 
Plant operation will be adversely affected as pressure drop increases through the 
catalyst bed. This may be due to:  
• Dust formed from catalyst disintegration during changing and operation. 
• Entrained liquid cementing the catalyst.  
• Entrained solids blocking the bed.  
• Collapsed beds following mechanical damage to bed supports. 
• Carbon formation from organic feedstocks.  
 
These problems generally affect the temperature proﬁles in the bed and, 
possibly, the overall reaction. The catalyst must be strong enough to resist vari-
ous forms of regeneration or reactivation.  
1.3.  
 CATALYST PRODUCTION  
Catalysts are produced in different ways depending on the chemical formulation 
and the severity of the chemical process in which they will be operated. The 
usual methods are listed in Table 1.5. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show typical catalyst 
production facilities (See also Table 1.9 where some unit operations used in cat-
alyst manufacturing are listed).

Chapter 1 
Many of the earliest catalysts were based on natural products or porous re-
fractory materials that were available commercially, but improved catalysts were 
especially made as large-scale processes developed. Table 1.6 shows some of 
the materials that have been used as support. 
 
The principal objective in catalyst production, however, has usually been to 
make a suitable catalyst for any large-scale process by the most reasonable eco-
nomical procedure. Catalysts with a speciﬁc chemical composition have been 
established and appropriate standards for such physical properties as particle 
size and strength have been developed for most commercial processes. Target 
speciﬁcations provide for reasonably predictable operation at an acceptable 
pressure drop when used in standard plant equipment. After the initial period of 
deactivation, provided that the decline of catalyst performance is very slow and 
predictable, a process can be designed that is economic over the life span of the 
catalyst. A typical catalyst speciﬁcation is shown in Table 1.7.  
 
The most frequently used methods to produce catalysts are precipitation and 
impregnation. In both processes the catalyst precursors are usually converted to 
oxides by heating and the powders converted to solid granules or pellets. Cata-
lysts  often contain promoters  that are added  during the preparation stages. If

necessary, a support may be included with the solutions used during 
precipitation, as well as being impregnated directly with oxide precursors.  
 
Many catalysts can be made by either of the two methods. Precipitation is 
usually chosen if a support is not porous enough for sufﬁcient active metal to be 
loaded by impregnation. On the other hand, low concentrations of expensive 
precious metals are impregnated on to suitable supports particularly when they 
can be deposited on the surface of the support for greater efficiency. Conditions 
must be carefully controlled during catalyst production to give consistent 
quality. The checks carried out during all stages of production are listed in Table 1.8.

Chapter 1 
 
Porosity and surface area are probably the most important properties of a 
catalyst as they control access to the active sites of the catalyst. Pore size and 
surface areas can be moderated in a number of ways to control selectivity and 
access of large molecules to the catalyst. It is interesting to remember that 500 g 
of catalyst with a surface area of 100 m2.g−1 has a total area of about 12 acres. A 
catalyst charge of 40 tonnes therefore has a total surface of almost 1 million 
acres. An amazing ﬁgure!  
 
1.3.1.  Precipitation  
 
Aqueous solutions of the metal salts, usually nitrates or sulfates, are precipitated 
with an alkali such as sodium carbonate. Ammonium carbonate can be used to 
avoid residual sodium impurity, but it is relatively expensive. Occasionally 
precipitation conditions are controlled to form complex catalyst precursors and 
higher-activity products. If necessary, any support material can be added as a 
powder before the alkali is added.  
 
When the precipitate has formed and settled, it is ﬁltered and carefully 
washed before drying. Dried mud is then calcined at a temperature in the range 
3000– 4500C to decompose hydrates and carbonates. The calcined mud can then 
be grounded to powder and densiﬁed with a suitable lubricant before being 
pelletted. Many important practical details are involved in precipitating 
catalysts. The following are some points to remember:  
• It is necessary to precipitate rapidly and maintain a uniform pH. This pro-
duces small active crystallites and well-mixed oxides in the ﬁnished 
catalyst. Under these conditions speciﬁc compounds form such as those 
described by Feitknecht, with the composition (M2+)6(M3+)2 (OH)16 (CO3) 
4H2O. The Adkins catalyst, copper/ammonium chromate, is another 
example of applying a speciﬁc precipitation procedure.  
• Slow precipitation of metals from solution is possible by the slow 
hydrolysis of urea or nitrite at about 900C. This procedure is quite slow 
and using it may be expensive for many catalysts.  
• When preparing a nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalyst, reaction between the com-
ponents leads to the formation of nickel silicates, which are difﬁcult to 
reduce. This can affect operation and the catalyst may require prereduction 
before use. The addition of a promoter such as copper oxide allows reduction 
at a lower temperature.  
• When calcining chromium catalysts in air any Cr3+ is oxidized to Cr6+ at 
temperatures exceeding 2000C. Further calcination up to about 4500C 
reduces the Cr6+ content to a practical level and avoids an exothermic 
reduction reaction in the plant.  
 
 
 
Industrial Catalysts

1.3.2.  Impregnation  
 
Preformed, absorbent supports are uniformly saturated with a solution of the 
catalytic metals. Several impregnations may be needed to obtain the required 
metal loading. Supports must be strong enough to be immersed directly into the 
solution and any dust forming should not contaminate the catalyst surface. To 
avoid these difﬁculties, the supports can be sprayed with just enough solution to 
completely ﬁll the pores. At this point the support suddenly appears to be wet 
and the procedure is known as incipient wetness. In some cases, when the 
support has been impregnated, the metals may be precipitated by immersion in a 
second solution.  
After impregnation catalysts are carefully dried and most are calcined 
before use to decompose the metal salts to oxides. Care is necessary to avoid 
high concentrations of metals forming at the support surface as the solution 
evaporates. Most types of supports can be used to produce impregnated 
catalysts, although alumina or silica, in various forms, is usually chosen. The 
support should not, of course, react with the metal solution. For example, if the 
support is soluble in acid, there is a possibility of re-precipitation in an 
undesirable form.  
 
1.3.3.  Other Production Methods  
 
Many other procedures have been used to produce catalysts:  
• Platinum/rhodium alloy gauze is used as a catalyst in the selective 
oxidation of ammonia during nitric acid production and in the production 
of hydrogen cyanide. The wire in the gauze is only a few thousandths of 
an inch in diameter woven at 80 wires per inch. Several layers of gauze, 
up to about 8 ft in diameter, are used.  
• Silver granules are used to oxidize methanol to formaldehyde. Raney 
nickel is produced by leaching aluminum from a nickel/aluminum alloy 
with alkali solution. Not all of the alumina is removed and the catalyst 
may be regenerated a number of times by alkali treatment.  
• Mixtures of natural magnetite and various promoters are melted in a 
furnace at about 16000C and chill cooled by casting on a ﬂat surface. The 
catalyst can be crushed and separated into appropriate size ranges before 
use in ammonia synthesis or Fischer–Tropsch processes.  
• In large modern ammonia plants the synthesis catalyst is often used in a 
pre-reduced form. The catalyst is carefully reduced in a mixture of 
hydrogen and nitrogen and then re-oxidized with a mixture of oxygen and 
nitrogen. Less than 20% of the iron is re-oxidized, making plant start-up 
14 
Chapter 1 
much easier and ensuring that the catalyst is not pyrophoric before use. 
Some nickel oxide catalysts supported on silica are also pre-reduced.  
1.4.  
 CATALYST TESTING  
Industrial catalysts must conform to a strict speciﬁcation and physical and chem-
ical properties are measured at all stages of production. The tests most often 
included in catalyst speciﬁcations are listed in Table 1.7.  
 
1.4.1.  Physical Tests  
 
It is most important that the catalyst be strong enough to resist breakage and 
attrition. Fixed bed and tubular reactors are carefully ﬁlled with catalyst to 
ensure that the pellets or granules are not damaged and pack with a uniform 
density.  
 
Strength is particularly important in processes in which catalysts are 
circulated continuously between the reactor and a regenerator. In the ﬂuid 
catalytic cracking process signiﬁcant daily additions of catalyst must be made to 
compensate for losses through attrition as well as catalyst deactivation.  
 
1.4.2.  Chemical Composition  
 
Careful checks on the chemical composition of both raw materials and products 
are required to ensure that the speciﬁcation is achieved. It is important to 
conﬁrm that the desired chemical compounds are formed with the required 
crystalline form and particle size. It is very easy for the pH of the solution to 
change during precipitation reactions and inﬂuence the composition of the 
precipitate.  
 
Elemental analysis of the bulk components in a catalyst is measured by X-
ray ﬂuorescence (XRF), which has now replaced traditional wet analysis. If 
required, electron probe analysis can also provide information on the 
distribution of elements in a catalyst particle. Bulk phases in a catalyst and 
crystallite size are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as either a routine 
check or a diagnostic procedure to examine catalysts damaged during operation.  
 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) 
with either air or inert atmospheres show weight changes or heat evolution as 
catalyst samples are heated and intermediate chemical compounds decompose. 
The tests are therefore useful in providing information on temperature-related 
phase changes at different stages of catalyst preparation. Tests also show how 
discharged catalysts react during regeneration or oxidation. Temperature 
 
Industrial Catalysts

programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen is used to investigate similar changes 
during catalyst reduction over the appropriate temperature range. These 
procedures are widely used in catalyst development and routine testing.  
 
Many other tests are used to measure the physical and chemical properties 
of industrial catalysts during development and routine examination. These are 
fully described in other publications but are summarized here in Tables 1.9 and 
1.10.  
 
1.4.3.  Activity Testing  
 
Activity measurements have been important ever since industrial catalysts were 
ﬁrst introduced. BASF carried out some 20,000 tests during the production of a 
successful ammonia synthesis catalyst. Until the 1960s, however, when many 
new catalytic processes were developed, laboratory activity tests were fairly 
crude. It was only possible to screen different samples and obtain relative 
activities before new catalysts reached the semitechnical plant stage and 
commercial trials were considered possible. More recently, new testing 
equipment has been able to simulate plant conditions and provide accurate 
kinetic information for reliable design calculations.

The average pore radius assuming cylindrical pores is calculated 
as twice the pore volume divided by the surface area.

There are several steps during the catalytic reaction before a gas molecule is 
available for reaction at the active surface. First, it must (a) pass through the gas 
ﬁlm surrounding the catalyst particle, (b) diffuse through the catalyst pores and 
reach  an  active  site,  and  (c)  adsorb on the active site  to  react  with  adjacent 
molecules. Products then (d) desorb from the active site, (e) return through the 
catalyst pores to the catalyst surface, and (f) re-enter the gas phase. 
 
This process is dynamic and may depend on the reacting molecules moving 
from site to site until reaction takes place and products can desorb. Under ideal 
conditions, there would be no ﬁlm or pore diffusion limitations but, practically, 
these are often encountered in catalytic reactions, particularly when large rings 
or pellets operate at a relatively low linear velocity.  
 
Simple screening tests can be developed for most reactions to compare the 
activity of different catalysts. It is important, however, to standardize operating 
conditions and to operate well away from equilibrium conversion, to obtain the 
most useful results. To avoid all diffusion limitations, catalyst samples are 
normally tested at a high linear velocity with small crushed particles. Test units 
operate with pure gas mixtures and the effects of typical poisons must be 
considered in separate tests. Until the 1960s, the screening tests operated at 
atmospheric pressure and compared the performance of new catalysts with an 
accepted standard at constant space velocity.

Atmospheric pressure test units cannot give the information required for 
modern catalyst and process development and have been replaced with high 
pressure micro-reactors. To avoid diffusion limitations, micro-reactors operate at 
very low conversions, under isothermal conditions, using small quantities of 
crushed catalyst. Experimental catalysts are usually tested in the same process 
conditions over a range of gas rates to provide useful design information. The 
ratio of space velocities measured at the same conversion gives the relative 
activity of different catalysts and an indication of the catalyst volume needed to 
give the same performance. It is also possible, when using pulsed gas ﬂow at a 
constant space velocity and process conditions, to measure the catalyst 
selectivity in a reaction over an appropriate temperature range.  
 
Knowledge of reaction kinetics is required to enable engineers to design a 
catalytic reactor. To obtain this information it is usual to use full-size catalyst 
particles over the total range of plant operating conditions to determine an 
accurate rate of reaction. This became possible by the introduction of continuous 
stirred tank reactors. These give results directly for conditions that are almost 
uniform throughout the reactor with none of the gradients found in micro-
reactors. Two popular types of high-pressure reactors are the Carberry reactor, 
in which the catalyst is held in a cross-shaped basket and rotated, and the Berti 
reactor, which recycles gas through a ﬁxed bed of catalyst. Several catalytic 
reactors are listed in Table 1.11.

 CATALYST OPERATION  
In 1887 George Edward Davis gave a series of lectures at the Manchester 
Technical School describing the current technology in use in the chemical 
industry. By identifying combinations of the same basic operations, he found a 
novel approach to describe each process. This was the same concept that Arthur 
D. Little discussed in a 1915 report to the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, when he proposed the idea of unit processes. These suggestions led 
to a more systematic approach to the education of future chemical engineers and 
the design of chemical processes. Nowadays most chemical processes use 
combinations of catalysts in standard reactors that ﬁt neatly into a range of 
different units.  
 
1.5.1.  Reactor Design  
 
Chemical processes often combine several catalytic reactions and standard ﬂow 
sheets have been evolved over the years by process operators and chemical con-
tractors. Catalytic reactors are designed from knowledge of the reaction kinetics 
and the inﬂuence of operating conditions and feed gas impurities on catalyst 
performance. Catalyst volumes and operating conditions have therefore been 
optimized on the basis of experience and established process design, which 
means that design operation and catalyst life are generally reliable unless there 
are unexpected operating problems. Table 1.12 lists major catalytic processes 
and their industrial applications and indicates when they were introduced.  
 
1.5.2.  Catalytic Reactors  
 
Reactors are always designed to ensure that the operating conditions do not 
damage the catalyst:

• For most processes this is possible with ﬁxed adiabatic beds in which the 
temperature rise corresponds to the conversion. If the maximum 
temperature would damage the catalyst, several beds are used with 
interbed cooling using heat exchange or quench. The total catalyst 
volume is unchanged and is simply distributed among the beds to control 
the temperature rise and achieve the design conversion.  
• With strongly exothermic or endothermic reactions tubular reactors are 
used to control selectivity or prevent catalyst deactivation. Tubes are 
either cooled or heated to maintain the catalyst temperature and approach 
to equilibrium.  
• Poisons present in the feed to the reactor can be removed if necessary by 
installing guard beds. These can be either a speciﬁc absorbent or an 
additional volume of catalyst that is replaced when saturated.

• In some reactions carbon deposition gradually deactivates the catalyst. If 
this happens an additional reactor may be installed in parallel that allows 
the on-line reactor to be isolated and regenerated as the plant operates 
continuously.  
• In catalytic cracking units the catalyst is rapidly deactivated. A ﬂuidized 
catalyst bed is used in which very small catalyst particles are ﬂuidized in 
the ﬂow of feed gas. Deactivated catalyst is circulated continuously 
through a regenerator and back to the reactor.  
20 
Chapter 1 
• If the temperature rise in an adiabatic reactor requires too many beds, the 
overall reaction can be made more selective and operation more 
economic by using a ﬂuidized bed of catalyst at a uniform temperature.  
• Continuous catalytic reformers circulate solid catalyst between the reactor 
and regenerator to achieve continuous operation. 
The most widely used reactors are shown in Table 1.13, although batch reactors 
are not often used in full-scale operation.  
 
1.5.3.  Catalyst Operating Conditions  
 
Catalyst life must be predictable to avoid unexpected shut down and lost produc-
tion. It is necessary therefore to establish good operating procedures that achieve

the best life possible, so that all catalyst replacements can be arranged during 
scheduled maintenance periods. Normal deactivation caused by slow sintering of 
the catalyst, absorption of small quantities of poisons, or carbon deposition can 
be taken into account during plant design by installing guard vessels or using a 
known excess of catalyst.  
 
Reliable commissioning is an important part of plant operation and is care-
fully planned with the assistance of engineering specialists and catalyst 
suppliers. Modern plants use hundreds of tonnes of different catalysts, which 
represent a signiﬁcant proportion of the capital cost. The ordering, supply, 
storage, installation, and proper reduction to the active form take a considerable 
period and must be properly organized:  
 
Industrial Catalysts 
21 
• Catalysts must be handled carefully during loading to prevent breakage 
and dust formation. They are loaded according to detailed speciﬁed 
instructions to give uniform packing.  
• Start-up procedures involve drying and activating the catalyst, usually by 
reduction in controlled ﬂows of hydrogen and inert gas at speciﬁed 
temperatures.  
• Operation starts under controlled conditions to avoid hot spots in the 
catalyst bed or temperature run-away reactions. 
• During operation, the conditions must be checked at regular intervals to 
maintain the design operating temperature and conversion to ensure the 
maximum catalyst life. 
• The cost of closing down a large plant is so high that reliability of 
catalysts and process operations is essential. 
 
Typical reduction and operating conditions for industrial catalysts are 
described in the appropriate chapters. Despite efforts to protect the catalyst from 
poisons or maloperation, it is still possible for problems to affect the catalyst. A 
few typical examples are shown in Table 1.14.  
 
Steps must be taken to restore good performance following maloperation. 
Unfortunately this often involves shutting down the process or isolating the 
individual reactor to change the catalyst. To avoid loss of production it is 
possible to install a spare reactor for use in case of an emergency. For example, 
spare reactors are essential when removing acetylene from steam-cracker 
ethylene streams because polymers, known as green oil, saturate the catalyst 
pores. On the whole, however, once a process becomes established and teething 
troubles are sorted out most problems can be avoided or the process design 
modiﬁed.  
1.6.  
 CONCLUSION  
There was a remarkable interest in catalysts before 1900 considering the 
primitive state of industrial production at the time. Several catalytic processes 
that are still used today were being introduced on a relatively large scale. During 
1900, for example, the worldwide production of sulfuric acid was about 4 
million  tonnes. Thereafter the introduction of catalytic processes played an 
increasing part in the expansion of chemical production. The pioneering work of 
Sabatier and Ipatieff demonstrated the potential of a wide range of catalytic 
reactions and the beneﬁts of operation at high pressures. These ideas were 
gradually developed to cope with consumer demands.  
 
The use of new catalyst-based technology, introduced by early chemical 
producers, was soon expanded by chemical engineering contractors, ﬁrst in the

industry has introduced a wider range of very sophisticated new catalysts. After 
nearly 100 years of continuous development most chemical processes are now 
based on the use of catalysts.

THE FIRST CATALYSTS  
 
 
 
 
Efforts to develop processes using catalysts were vital to the growth of the 
chemical industry. For many years, the ﬁrst catalysts were most probably the 
result of trial and error and were based on the observations of scientists. When 
Berzelius deﬁned catalysis, the examples he quoted did not include any industri-
al applications. For example, no mention was made of the lead chamber process 
or the Phillips patent proposing the use of a platinum catalyst for sulfuric acid 
production.  
When the chemical industry began to expand, BASF improved the contact 
process and, following Haber’s investigations, introduced ammonia synthesis, 
which provided a practical basis for catalyst design.  
However, as Miles noted in his book on the contact process, published by 
Gurney and Jackson in 1925, the secrecy surrounding new processes slowed 
down the release of technical information. Miles tried to reverse a situation in 
which no process was completely described until it was out of date!  
Many changes have now been made to the ﬁrst catalysts since they were in-
troduced, but they are still being used and, with more recent introductions, are 
indispensable in the modern chemical, reﬁning and petrochemical industries.  
2.1.  
SULFURIC ACID  
Large-scale production of sulfuric acid began in about 1740 when Joshua Ward 
burned sulfur and niter in glass bell jars with a capacity as high as 66 gal. This 
procedure was improved in 1746 by Dr John Roebuck and Samuel Gardner at

their Birmingham, UK, vitriol manufactory, where they burned the sulfur and 
niter in lead houses. This was the critical step in producing tonnage quantities of 
sulfuric acid for the ﬁrst time.  
Later, Roebuck’s factory in Glasgow incorporated a suggestion by J. A. 
Chaptal (Napoleon’s Minister for Agriculture) that the sulfur and niter should be 
burned in an external furnace. While this meant that the sulfur dioxide and the 
nitrogen dioxide catalyst were passed into the lead chamber with a current of 
steam, it was some time before the process became really continuous. The size 
of the lead chambers increased from about 200 ft3 in Roebuck’s plants, produc-
ing about 25 lb of acid a day, to about 5000–10,000 ft3 
by 1820.  
Large-scale production led to the price of acid falling from about £30 per 
ton in 1790–1800 to £3.5 per ton in 1820, when UK production of sulfuric acid 
was about 10,000 tons a year. Removal of the UK salt tax in 1825 reduced the 
price still further to £1.25 per ton.  
 
2.1.1.  The Lead Chamber Process  
 
At ﬁrst it was not known that niter, which was an essential part of the lead 
chamber process, acted as a catalyst. When Lavoisier showed that sulfuric acid 
contained only sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen (1772–1777) it was realized that 
niter was not a component of chamber acid. Operators then assumed that it ei-
ther made the sulfur ﬂame hotter or supplied oxygen to the sulfurous acid.  
At that time, acid was still being made in batches and no air was added to 
the lead house during reaction. By 1793 Clement and Desormes had suggested 
that the continuous addition of air would improve reaction, and in 1806 they 
deﬁned the action of niter, which was clearly essential to the process:1 
 “ . . . nitric acid is only the instrument of the complete oxygenation of 
the sulfur: it is the base, nitric oxide, that takes the oxygen from the at-
mospheric air to offer it to the sulfurous acid in the state which suits it 
best . . . ”  
Clement and Desormes were also the ﬁrst to observe the formation of chamber 
crystals that evolved nitric oxide and formed sulfuric acid when added to water. 
The nitric oxide was then available for recycling.  
The basis of the lead chamber process was, therefore, to combine sulfur di-
oxide with the oxygen in air in the presence of a relatively small amount of niter. 
Some details of the process development are summarized in Table 2.1 and a 
typical lead chamber plant is shown in Figure 2.1. Despite this conclusion, many 
UK producers continued to operate the process in batches until as late as 1820. 
The fact that it was difficult to transport sulfuric acid meant that many small, on-
site plants supplied users directly. This, of course, eliminated competition and 
delayed technical developments. Even after the eventual introduction of the con-
tact process during the 1920s, the lead chamber process was still widely

Nitrogen oxides were lost to the atmosphere with the residual nitrogen dur-
ing operation of lead chamber plants. This led Gay-Lussac to suggest in 1828 
that efﬂuent nitrogen be washed with chamber acid in a separate tower to dis-
solve the nitrogen oxides, which could then be recycled. Because it was difficult 
to liberate the nitrogen oxides without diluting the chamber acid, Gay-Lussac 
towers were not often used. Finally, in 1859, Glover passed the nitrous vitriol 
down through a second tower, where hot gas from the pyrites burner removed 
the nitrogen oxides, which were returned to the lead chambers.2 This procedure 
was important as it also concentrated the acid. The combined Gay-Lussac and 
Glover towers were, therefore, the ﬁrst catalyst recovery plants. A tower built in 
1868 concentrated 73,000 tonnes of sulfuric acid to speciﬁc gravity 1.75  (80%

Process efficiency depended on gas mixing in the lead chambers. Major im-
provements in operating the lead chamber process were the use of packed towers 
by Gaillard-Parrish and Peterson, the introduction of conical towers by Mills and 
Packard, and process designs introduced by Kachkaroff.6 Chamber acid was 
dilute 65% sulfuric acid as produced but could be concentrated to 80% in the 
Glover tower.  
 
2.1.1.2.  The Continuing Use of the Lead Chamber Process  
 
Lead chamber plants were used for many years after the introduction of the con-
tact process in which small companies made acid for their own operations. Table 
2.2 shows that in both the United States and the United Kingdom production of 
chamber acid continued until well after the 1960s.  
 
At least one lead chamber plant was still operating in the north of England 
in 1960. There were plumbers patching the lead chamber and carpenters regular-
ly replacing the wooden ducting used to transfer acid from the chambers to the 
point of use.

In fact new lead chamber plants were still being offered by a contractor in 
1958.6 A description of  the Kachkaroff process shows how the old plants oper-
ated. The burner, which produced reaction gas, was followed by four large cy-
lindrical reaction vessels in which sulfur dioxide reacted with oxygen, catalyzed 
by the circulation of nitrous vitriol and gaseous nitrogen oxides. Nitrous vitriol 
was a solution of 10–15 wt% nitrogen oxides in sulfuric acid. Nitrogen oxide 
losses were made up as required by a small ammonia oxidation unit.  
 
More than 80% of the sulfur dioxide was oxidized in the ﬁrst reaction ves-
sel. Reaction was rapid and the surface of the liquid was violently agitated. A 
consequence of this mixing was that as sulfuric acid was produced the gaseous 
nitrogen oxide catalyst dissolved to form more nitrous vitriol.  
 
The circulation of nitrous vitriol through the ﬁnal three reaction vessels was 
regulated to balance the conversion of the remaining sulfur dioxide. Inlet tem-
perature to each reaction vessel was controlled by cooling the circulating acid 
solution. A volume of the nitrous vitriol equal to the sulfuric acid being pro-
duced was removed from the circulating liquid when the reaction was completed 
and pumped to a denitration tower linked to an acid concentration tower. During 
denitration of the nitrous vitriol in the ﬁrst tower, the sulfuric acid was diluted 
from 80–85% to 60–68%. Cool acid was then concentrated by passing it down 
the second, concentration, tower, which also cooled the hot gases leaving the 
burner. Cooled burner gas then passed through the reaction vessels to continue 
the cycle.  
 
Overall loss of nitrogen oxide catalyst was equivalent to about 0.15 tons of 
nitric acid per ton of sulfuric acid produced, which was lower than in the con-
ventional, less sophisticated lead chamber process plants. Sulfuric acid could be 
obtained as either 77–82% or 60–80% solutions. An advantage of the more 
modern process was that the low-temperature operation allowed the use of PVC 
as piping, tower cladding, and storage tank linings.  
 
2.1.1.3.  Raw Material for Sulfuric Acid Production  
 
During the nineteenth century, the main source of sulfuric acid was Sicilian sul-
fur and most US plants continued to import sulfur from Sicily until the 1890s. 
However, in 1838 the king of Sicily gave an export monopoly to a French com-
pany, which increased the price from £5 to £14 per ton, and most European 
companies considered it necessary to ﬁnd an alternative raw material. Iron pyri-
tes was known to burn forming sulfur dioxide and, despite the presence of arse-
nic impurities, was used from about 1825. Spain became the major supplier of 
pyrites in Europe and sulfuric acid production was often associated with copper 
smelting. By 1860, most European plants were using pyrites, although, later, as 
spent oxide (sulfide iron oxide) started becoming available from gas works, it, 
too, was used as a source of sulfur.

Note:  These processes could have reduced costs of niter and lead used in the lead chamber process 
while improving production rate. Development was slow owing to a lack of technical experi-
ence and innovation. Demand for acid, in particular, was still small.  
  
 
Herman Frasch developed a process to recover cheap natural sulfur in 1891 
that was used ﬁrst in Louisiana and then in Texas, and eventually became the 
major source of supply, particularly in the United States. The recovery of 
reﬁnery sulfur by the modiﬁed Claus–Chance process now provides a further 
enormous supply of pure sulfur throughout the world, and this has largely re-
placed the Frasch process.  
 
2.1.2. Contact Process Development  
 
The contact process was patented as early as 1831 by Peregrine Phillips, the son 
of a vinegar maker in Bristol.7 His process involved a heated porcelain tube con-
taining ﬁnely divided platinum or wire to convert a stoichiometric mixture of 
sulfur dioxide and air to sulfur trioxide. The process was not commercial at that 
time for several reasons, including the engineering problems associated with 
circulating hot corrosive gases, the availability of acid resistant materials, and 
poisons in the sulphur dioxide. Table 2.3 shows the main developments leading

(1877).  
Described experiments to produce oleum using 8.5% platinum on 
asbestos with pure oxygen (73.3% conversion) or air (47.4% 
conversion). Used stoichiometric ratio of SO2/O2. Pure sulfur di-
oxide from decomposing sulfuric acid. Sulfur trioxide absorbed 
in water to form oleum. Their results were not thermodynamical-
ly possible—Ostwald later claimed it delayed developments [Z. 
Electrochem. 8, 154 (1902)].  
1875: Squire (and Messel)  
British Patent 3278 (1875) resulted from high oleum price. Used a 
platinum catalyst supported on pumice with a stoichiometric mix-
ture of SO2/O2 made from decomposing H2SO4 in a platinum still 
(70% recovery of SO3). Plant at Silvertown produced three tons 
of SO3 per week. Patent mentioned that this avoided catalyst de-
activation with dust and, probably arsenic although poisons were 
not recognized.  
1875–1880: Jacob  
Operated a contact process oleum plant in Germany at ﬁrst from 
decomposed chamber acid but later from sulfur burning (43% 
free SO3). Jacob sold his plant to Meister, Lucius, and Bruning at    
Hoechst, who still made oleum in 1925.  
1879: Thann Chemical 
Works, Alsace  
Acquired an improved oleum process design from Squire. Burned 
Sicilian sulfur and washed gas at 4 atm pressure. Mixed SO2 with 
stoichiometric volume of air and formed SO3 using platinized as-
bestos. Output 1.5 tons of SO3 per day and dissolved in concen-
trated H2SO4.  
1880s: BASF  
Began to use the same process as Thann, producing such large 
volumes that the oleum price fell. Production increased from 
18,500 tons during 1880 to 116,000 tons by 1900.  
 
 
Further development of the contact process did not rely on a better catalyst 
but depended on better methods to remove poisons and clean the gases produced 
by roasting pyrites, which, by then, had replaced sulfur as the preferred source 
of sulfur dioxide. In attempting to overcome the difficulty, the Mannheim pro-
cess used a bed of relatively inactive iron oxide to guard the main bed of a plati-
num catalyst. New Jersey Zinc and the General Chemical Company in the Unit-
ed States built plants of this kind in 1899 and 1901, respectively.  
A 1901 lecture by Rudolph Knietsch12 described the work carried out by 
BASF during the period 1880–1900.13 As might be expected, the early process 
developments he described were mainly empirical. They concerned washing of 
pyrite gas, determination of the most efﬁcient sulfur dioxide/oxygen ratios with 
excess oxygen for use in the feed gas, and absorption of sulfur trioxide in 98% 
acid to produce sulfuric acid. This information had been conﬁdential until the 
paper was published. Perhaps the most important detail, apart from the use of 
excess oxygen, was the cooling of the gas during reaction in tube-cooled reac-
tors to improve conversion, which was not part of earlier processes.  
32 
Chapter 2 
 
In a further signiﬁcant advance, De Haen ﬁrst demonstrated the use of va-
nadium pentoxide catalysts in 1900, following a suggestion by R. Meyers in 
Germany in 1898.14 There was little further progress at that time because the 
original vanadium pentoxide catalysts were relatively unstable and much less 
active than the platinum catalysts then available.  
 The contact process was developed as a matter of urgency during World 
War I because the effective nitration of toluene required the catalytic use of con-
centrated sulfuric acid to generate the active species, NO2
+
 . Nitration of toluene, 
of course, yields the military explosive, TNT. The increased demand for plati-
num could not be met economically, so that from 1914 on vanadium catalysts 
had to be introduced rapidly to expand sulfuric acid production. About one-third 
of German sulfuric acid at that time came from the contact process, but vanadi-
um catalysts were not used extensively in other parts of the world until the mid-
1920s.  
Porous supports were used to make commercial platinum sulfuric acid cata-
lysts. These included asbestos, kieselguhr, and silica gel. Rather surprisingly, 
water-soluble carriers such as magnesium sulfate were also successful and made 
platinum recovery more convenient. A flow sheet of a typical modern susphuric 
acid plant is shown in Figure 2.3.  Table 2.5 describes four typical industrial 
catalysts.

The performance of platinum catalysts depended strongly on the form of the 
support, which inﬂuenced crystallite size. Operating life depended on the poi-
sons present in the sulfur dioxide and was originally about two years. With pro-
cess improvements to remove poisons, the catalyst life eventually increased to 
about 10 years. Most reactors contained tubes that were cooled by exchange 
with cold inlet gas. The Grillo reactor contained trays with a form of heat ex-
change.  
Vanadium soon replaced platinum as the most economic catalyst for the 
contact process. The strike temperature at which reaction began was higher but, 
when necessary, a striker layer of platinum catalyst was used until better process 
designs were available. The big advantages of vanadium pentoxide were that it 
was both cheaper and less affected by common poisons such as halogens, phos-
phorus, arsenic, selenium, tellurium, and mercury. Platinum catalysts were prob-
ably replaced by vanadium sometime before 1930. Table 2.6 lists several of the 
early vanadium catalysts.  
Sulfuric acid catalysts containing vanadium pentoxide are characterized by 
complicated recipes and manufacturing procedures.  
Following the introduction of vanadium pentoxide by De Haen it was dis-
covered empirically by Slama and Wolf that alkalis improved catalyst activity 
and these have been used in all the catalysts produced ever since. They were 
speciﬁed as important for stability by both BASF and the General Chemical 
Company. Vanadium pentoxide catalysts had been used for more than 20 years 
before Frazer and Kirkpatrick22 showed that the addition of alkali led to the for-

mation of an active liquid catalyst melt held in the pores of the support. This 
consisted of liquid potassium pyrosulfate with dissolved vanadium pentoxide. 
Catalyst activity is about the same for vanadium pentoxide contents in the range 
2–10%, although higher levels give longer lives. Catalyst performance depends 
on the porosity and stability of the support, which controls and stabilizes the 
liquid melt to determine the life of the catalyst. Vanadium catalysts resist the 
effects of most poisons, although vanadium may be volatile in the presence of 
halogens.  
The main cause of operating problems is related to the deposition of en-
trained dust on the relatively wide but thin layers of catalyst in the reactor. Dust, 
which is usually carried into a reactor with feed gases, can also form by catalyst 
disintegration and leads to an increase in pressure drop. Feed gas from the roast-
ing of pyrite, anhydrite, or smelter gases is more likely to cause dust problems, 
but pure sulfur can also contain 0.5% ash, which should be reduced to less than 
0.002% by ﬁltering the liquid sulfur or using gas ﬁlters before the reactors. 
If pressure drop through the catalyst beds (or passes as they are normally 
called) increases then the catalyst can be removed during a normal shut-down 
period and sieved before being examined and replaced for future use. Catalysts 
in the form of rings or other shapes have now been introduced in order to mini-
mize pressure drop problems. A normal average life of a catalyst in sulfuric acid 
plants is usually more than 10 years.  
 
2.1.3.  Modern Sulfuric Acid Processes  
 
Modern vanadium pentoxide catalysts have been developed on a more scientiﬁc 
basis than those discovered empirically during the 1920s. Following Slama and 
Wolf’s
 use of alkali by to improve catalyst activity, Frazer and Kirkpatrick and 
then Kiyoura,22 realized that the catalyst was molten and ﬁlled the support pores 
during operation. Extensive investigation then led to an understanding of the 
ideal catalyst structure23 and the reaction mechanism.  
It is obvious now that the pores should be large enough to hold the melt as a 
thin ﬁlm without being completely ﬁlled. Furthermore, since this is an equilibri-
um reaction that is adversely affected by higher temperatures, the solid catalyst 
should melt at a sufficiently low temperature to alleviate this equilibrium limita-
tion. This was just about possible although the silica gel supports, prepared with 
an appropriate pore size and volume to increase low-temperature activity, tended 
to sinter at the operating temperature required in the ﬁrst bed of a multi bed re-
actor.24 It was often beneﬁcial to use kieselguhr supports to increase operating 
stability, so some operators used a stable catalyst in the ﬁrst bed with more ac-
tive formulations in the remaining beds. 
The catalyst melt contained vanadium compounds dissolved in a mixture of 
alkali pyrosulfates,25 which melt at a lower temperature as the atomic number of 
the alkali metal increases. Potassium sulfate containing a small proportion of 
36 
Chapter 2 
 
sodium sulfate was usually chosen, because it was cheaper than the higher-
atomic-weight alkali metals such as cesium. Satisfactory operation was therefore 
possible at a time when environmental controls were minimal and the price of 
sulfuric acid catalysts extremely low.  
During the experimental work following the discovery that the sulfuric acid 
catalyst was actually a liquid held in the pores of the silica support, several ob-
servations were signiﬁcant in understanding the way in which sulfur dioxide was 
oxidized:  
• The vanadium pentoxide dissolved in melted alkali pyrosulfate.  
• Activity and long life were associated with the reduction of pentavalent 
vanadium when alkali sulfates were used in catalyst production.  
• Sulfate or pyrosulfate ions were not found in the melted catalyst and the 
degree of sulfation was normally in excess of that required to form py-
rosulfate.  
 
Fresh catalyst contains vanadium pentoxide, potassium/sodium sulfate, and 
silica in the ratios required for high activity and stability. During stabilization 
with sulfur dioxide it is likely that the vanadium pentoxide ﬁrst dissolves to 
form pyrosulfate, which then reacts to give a mixture of polymeric ions. The 
melting point of the catalyst has been found to depend on the alkali met-
al/vanadium pentoxide ratio, up to about four, as well as the atomic weight of 
the alkali metal. The liquid state allows rapid formation of the polymeric ions, 
which are the active catalyst.26 According to Boreskov, they correspond to 
speciﬁc compounds with a general composition V2O5xnK2OxmSO3, where n = 2, 
3, or 4 and m is approximately 2n. Crystals with these compositions had been 
isolated from melted catalyst. At high sulfur dioxide concentration, melts also 
contain K2OxV2O4x3SO3. Polymers formed by direct absorption of sulfur triox-
ide or copolymerization of existing ions often have molecular weights that ex-
ceed 1000.  
 
The redox mechanism of sulfur dioxide oxidation was ﬁrst explained by 
Mars and Maesson,27 
who proposed that the oxidation to sulfur trioxide led to 
the reduction of pentavalent vanadium in the polymeric ions. The resulting tet-
ravalent vanadium was then reoxidized by adsorption of molecular oxygen. On 
occasions when a catalyst is partially deactivated by process gas containing a 
high sulfur dioxide concentration and low oxygen concentration, it is possible to 
regenerate the catalyst simply by heating in air at about 4500–5000C.  
 
2.1.3.1.  Catalyst Preparation  
 
Catalyst is prepared by mixing a silica sol made from potassium silicate with 
vanadyl sulfate or ammonia metavanadate and precipitating with ammonia. The 
silica used can be either  fresh or a solid such as kieselguhr.  A  sol  mixed  with

kieselguhr can react to give the zeolite support described by early catalyst pro-
ducers. No ﬁltering or washing is required and after drying the powder can be 
formed into shapes by the usual methods. Finished catalyst has the composition 
and physical properties shown in Table 2.7.  
 
A list of some US patents describing catalyst preparation between 1935 and 
1981 was given by Donovan, in Leach: Applied Industrial Catalysts, Vol. 2, Ch. 
7, Academic Press, 1983.  
 
Before use the catalyst is generally pretreated in a stream of air containing a 
low concentration of sulfur dioxide. This sulfates the vanadium compounds and 
avoids an undesirable exothermic reaction when operation begins. However, 
ﬁnal sulfation in the reactor does assist in start-up by increasing catalyst temper-
ature faster than using heated feed gas and heat exchange between the beds.  
 
2.1.3.2.  Sulfuric Acid Plant Design  
 
Conventional contact process sulfuric acid plants operate with four adiabatic 
catalyst beds, or passes. Heat of reaction is removed after each bed by heat ex-
change to generate steam or by quenching with cold air.  
 
Up to the 1960s sulfur trioxide was recovered by a single absorption stage 
at the outlet of the fourth bed. A typical plant design limited the catalyst volume 
used in the ﬁrst bed by the minimum inlet temperature of up to 4200C, at which 
the catalyst was active, and the approach to the equilibrium conversion of sulfur 
dioxide to sulfur trioxide at about 6000C. By coincidence, the maximum reason-
able operating temperature to avoid deactivation in the ﬁrst bed of catalyst was 
about 6000–6500C. Catalyst volumes in the ﬁnal three beds were also designed 
to maximize conversion within the same limits of inlet temperature and equilib-
rium. This made it difficult to achieve more than 98.5% conversion consistently 
in four beds, even with large volumes of catalyst, as shown in Table 2.8B.  
38 
Chapter 2 
 
Better conversion was achieved when double absorption plants were intro-
duced on a large scale during the 1960s.28 As shown in Table 2.8B, the ﬁrst three 
beds were operated in the same way as in the conventional plants but when gas-
es left the converter to be cooled they also passed through an intermediate sulfur 
trioxide absorber. On re-entering to the ﬁnal bed, a better equilibrium conver-
sion, in some cases up to 99.8%, was achieved as a result of the lower sulfur 
trioxide content. Double absorption is now widely used despite the extra cost of 
equipment. The process was even more useful as all of the new plants being 
built in the United States needed to use double absorption or stack scrubbing 
systems to comply with strict environmental regulations from 1966 introduced.  
 
2.1.3.3.  Cesium-Promoted Catalysts  
 
The use of catalysts in which some of the potassium is replaced by cesium 
provided the more active catalyst anticipated from earlier development work.29 
A striking temperature as low as 3200C was reported in a full-scale four-bed 
plant, and  operation was possible at a stable  bed-1 inlet temperature of  3700C.

Operation of the cesium catalyst at a much lower inlet temperature than the po-
tassium-promoted catalyst achieved a sulfur dioxide conversion in the range 
99.2–99.6%. This was comparable to a double-absorption plant but with a lower 
capital cost apart from increased heat exchange capacity and a slightly more 
expensive catalyst. It allows producers to use existing four-bed single-absorption 
units and meet environmental demands without the capital expense of a new 
plant.  
 
2.1.3.4.  Sulfuric Acid Plant Operation  
 
Sulfuric acid plants are designed with optimized catalyst volumes and bed inlet 
temperatures to give a reasonable approach to equilibrium in each bed to achieve 
the maximum possible conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide. As shown 
by the examples in Table 2.8, this results in a signiﬁcantly smaller volume in 
bed 1 than the remaining beds. The total catalyst volume used normally corre-
sponds to a loading of 180–220 liters of catalyst per tonne of sulfuric acid pro-
duced per day although many plants use more, depending on conditions and the 
source of the sulfur dioxide. Lower volumes of catalyst are normally used in 
double-absorption units.  
 
2.1.3.5.  Improved Catalyst Shapes  
 
The main problem in operating sulfuric acid plants using an extruded catalyst is 
usually increasing pressure drop through the reactor, which can result from dust 
or other impurities in process gas, which generally deposit at the top of the ﬁrst 
bed. The catalyst must, therefore, be removed at intervals, screened to remove 
the accumulated dust, and replaced. On average the ﬁrst bed has to be sieved at 
intervals of 1 to 3 years and the remaining beds at longer intervals. Catalyst life 
usually exceeds 10 years.  
Modern catalysts are now supplied in a variety of shapes, all with the same 
composition. These allow longer continuous operation, at a lower pressure drop, 
by distributing the dust to prevent the formation of a crust. Shapes are available 
as rings of various diameters, often with ﬂuted surfaces (ribs) and simple ﬂuted 
extrudates.30 Use of any shaped catalyst can also offer more than 30% reduction 
in pressure drop and, often, increased activity to allow more operating ﬂexibil-
ity. The best combination of shapes to be used in particular plants is recom-
mended by catalyst suppliers.  
2.2.  
THE DEACON PROCESS  
Scheele’s discovery of chlorine in 1774 was soon followed by its use to bleach 
cotton and linen. The Deacon process, which made use of one of the ﬁrst indus-
40 
Chapter 2 
 
trial catalysts to be especially designed rather than discovered empirically,31 was 
used to produce chlorine from about 1870, until it was superseded by the elec-
trolysis of brine.  
 
2.2.1.  The Process  
 
In the Deacon Process, chlorine was produced from hydrochloric acid, the low-
value by-product of the Le Blanc process, by catalytic oxidation with air. Dea-
con used a copper chloride catalyst that could combine with oxygen and hydro-
chloric acid and form chlorine through an oxidation/reduction cycle.  
 
2.2.2.  Operation  
 
The overall reaction can be summarized as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
CuCl2 
     
4 HCl + O2              2 Cl2 + 2 H2O 
(2.5) 
 
 
Hurter, in 1883, suggested that the reaction mechanism involved three stages:32
  
• Thermal decomposition of cupric chloride by heating at 5000C in a stream 
of 40% hydrochloric acid and air:  
2 CuCl2 → Cu2Cl2 + Cl2

The overall reaction is exothermic and controlled by equilibrium.  
It was found that despite lower equilibrium yields, the optimum reaction 
rate was achieved in the temperature range 4000–4500C, giving only about 70% 
conversion of hydrochloric acid to chlorine.33 Water formed during the reaction 
had to be removed from the gas leaving the ﬁrst reactor and a second reactor 
included to increase conversion up to about 85%.  
Operation at high temperatures led to catalyst problems because copper 
chlorides are volatile and chlorine corroded the equipment. It was reported in 
1921 that the cost of copper lost per ton of bleach produced was one shilling!34

At the same time, the low melting point of copper chloride meant that the cata-
lyst operated as a liquid in the pores of the baked clay support. The process 
could not be used successfully on a large scale until the sulfur and arsenic impu-
rities in the hydrochloric acid gas were removed by scrubbing with hot sulfuric 
acid, which is an early example of gas puriﬁcation to remove catalyst poisons.35  
 
2.2.3.  Catalyst Preparation  
 
Deacon catalyst was prepared by impregnating a suitable porous and heat-
resistant solid—ﬁrebrick and pumice could be used—with an aqueous solution 
of copper chloride. The ﬁnal catalyst contained about 10 wt% of copper chlo-
ride.  
 
2.2.4. Development  
 
Although the Deacon process was only used for about 40 years, it is still of 
interest for two reasons: as an example of a catalyst selected by logical rather 
than empirical procedures and as an illustration of the need to remove poisons 
from process gases. Derivatives of the Deacon catalyst are still used in the pro-
duction of ethylene dichloride, by the oxychlorination of ethylene.  
2.3.  
CLAUS SULFUR RECOVERY PROCESS  
Sulfur recovery from sour natural gas or reﬁnery off-gas streams is not only es-
sential to avoid air pollution but also has become the main source of elemental 
sulphur, the key raw material for sulfuric acid production.  
Claus sulfur recovery plants were reintroduced in about 1950, when a short-
age of Frasch sulfur was anticipated. Subsequently, capacity was increased fur-
ther with the need to process crude oils with high sulfur content. By the 1990s 
some two-thirds of US reﬁneries, representing almost 90% of the crude oil treat-
ed, had acid gas treatment facilities to recover more than 60% of the total sulfur 
in the crude. This proportion will increase even further to meet new Environ-
mental Protection Agency sulfur emission regulations, and virtually all reﬁnery 
projects include new sulfur units or plans to expand existing facilities. The addi-
tional sulfur produced will result in the closure of Frasch sulfur capacity.  
World production of Claus sulfur was about 22 million tonnes during 1998 
(production capacity 45 million tonnes)—an important contribution from such a 
relatively uncomplicated catalytic process.

2.3.1.  The Claus Process  
The Claus process to recover and recycle sulfur in the Le Blanc process, based 
on the procedure suggested by C. F. Claus in 1883,36 was introduced in 1887 by 
A. M. Chance. Alkali waste containing calcium sulﬁde was suspended in water, 
and hydrogen sulﬁde was generated by pumping carbon dioxide through the 
slurry:  
 
   
CaS + CO2 + H2O → CaCO3 + H2S 
(2.9) 
 
Sulfur could then be recovered by passing the hydrogen sulﬁde, in a stream of 
air, through a kiln containing an iron catalyst.  
The modern two-step process converts hydrogen sulﬁde mixed with a stoi-
chiometric volume of air to sulfur. In theory, one-third of the hydrogen sulﬁde is 
oxidized to sulfur dioxide in a carefully designed furnace, while the remaining 
hydrogen sulﬁde reacts with the sulfur dioxide to produce sulfur in two or more 
reactors containing a suitable catalyst.  
 
 
   
2 H2S + 3 O2  →  2 H2O + 2 SO2 
(2.10) 
 
 
   
SO2 + 2 H2S → 2 H2O + 3 S 
(2.11) 
 
In practice, up to 70% of the reaction can take place in the furnace before the 
gas is passed directly to the reactors.37 
 During the 1950s Claus plants operated 
at 90–95% conversion and tail gas containing the residual sulfur compounds was 
passed into the reﬁnery fuel gas system.38 
 
Complete conversion of hydrogen sulﬁde cannot be achieved in Claus 
plants because the reaction is limited by equilibrium, and unavoidable side reac-
tions in the furnace lead to the formation of carbon disulﬁde and carbon oxysul-
ﬁde, which are difficult to remove. Recent environmental legislation has re-
quired that the overall conversion of hydrogen sulfide should now exceed 99%. 
To achieve this requirement, new processes have been developed which can be 
added on to the tail of existing Claus plants, to meet the new target.  
 
2.3.2.  Claus Plant Operation  
 
Sulphur often occurs in crude petroleum as a complex mixture of organo-
sulphur compounds, such as sulfides, thiophenes and benzthiophenes. These are 
fairly intractable compounds and need to be converter to hydrogen sulfide prior 
to separation using the Claus Process. This is usually achieved by hydrogenoly-
sis of the sulphur derivative over cobalt/molybdenum or nickel molybdenum 
catalysts. Hydrogen sulfide is then separated from hydrocarbons by absorption 
in diethanolamine solution, but is usually contaminated with carbon dioxide. 
 
The First Catalysts 
43 
 
Acid gas from reﬁnery streams contains 70–90% hydrogen sulﬁde, whereas acid 
gas recovered from natural gas is often more diluted. The hydrogen sulﬁde con-
tent of feed gas to the furnace has a signiﬁcant effect on both plant and catalyst 
operation.  
With hydrogen sulﬁde concentrations greater than 60% the ﬂame tempera-
ture is stable and all the acid gas and air pass directly to the furnace. With con-
centrations less than 60% it may be necessary to preheat the gas mixture or even 
to split the stream so that 37% of the hydrogen sulﬁde burns in the furnace and 
the remainder goes directly to the ﬁrst catalytic reactor.  
During combustion, some 60–70% of the hydrogen sulﬁde is converted di-
rectly to sulfur. Flame temperature depends on the hydrogen sulﬁde content of 
the feed gas and can reach almost 13000C with more than 90% hydrogen sulﬁde.  
Careful furnace and burner design is essential to maximize sulfur formation 
and to ensure complete combustion of hydrocarbon impurities that would other-
wise damage the catalyst. Residual oxygen in gas from the furnace can also poi-
son the catalyst. A signiﬁcant excess of air must be avoided. At the temperature 
of the ﬂame, nitrogen and oxygen will combine to form a small amount of nitric 
oxide. This will catalyse the oxidation of sulphur dioxide to the trioxide, which 
will form sulfates on the catalyst and lead to deactivation. Side reactions affect-
ing the process also take place in the furnace. For example:  
• Carbon disulﬁde forms by reaction of sulfur with hydrocarbons:  
 
   
CH4 + 2 S → CS2 + 2 H2 
(2.12) 
 
   
CH4 + 4 S → CS2 + 2H2S 
(2.13) 
 
Both reactions are rapid and the carbon disulﬁde concentration at equilib-
rium reaches a maximum of almost 20 ppm at 9500C. Carbon disulﬁde 
formation becomes negligible as the furnace temperature approaches 
13000C.  
• Hydrogen sulﬁde cracks to form hydrogen, which produces carbon mon-
oxide by the reverse water gas shift reaction with the carbon dioxide. 
Carbon oxysulﬁde is formed by reaction of the carbon monoxide with 
sulphur: 
 
 
   
H2S → H2 + S 
(2.14) 
 
 
   
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O 
(2.15) 
 
 
   
CO + S → COS 
(2.16) 
 
44 
Chapter 2 
 
• Carbon oxysulﬁde and carbon disulﬁde also form by reaction of hydrogen 
sulﬁde with carbon dioxide:  
 
 
   
H2S + CO2 → COS + H2O 
(2.17) 
 
 
   
2 H2S + CO2 → CS2 + 2 H2O 
(2.18) 
 
The concentration of carbon oxysulﬁde reaches a maximum of 10–15 ppm 
at about 11000C but then declines as the ﬂame temperature reaches about 
13000C. Because the ﬂame temperature is proportional to the hydrogen sulﬁde 
content of the acid gas, both carbon disulﬁde and carbon oxysulﬁde concentra-
tions are more signiﬁcant when treating gases containing lower concentrations 
of hydrogen sulﬁde, particularly in the range 50–75%.  
A typical modern Claus sulphur recovery plant uses several reactors to 
achieve the equilibrium conversion of hydrogen sulfide. The complex gas mix-
ture from the furnace is cooled to condense sulfur and then reheated before it 
enters the ﬁrst catalyst reactor. There are generally three catalytic reactors in 
series containing a catalyst in series, with coolers at each reactor outlet to con-
dense sulfur as it forms. Typical operating conditions are shown in Table 2.9. 
Inlet and outlet temperatures in each reactor are controlled at levels high enough 
to prevent condensation of sulfur on the catalyst.  
Owing to the equilibrium limitation, it is not possible to achieve 100% con-
version simply by adding more reactors and catalyst to the plant. Overall con-

Note: The Reactor 1 conditions are a compromise between the need for a temperature as high as 
3500C for a maximum conversion of COS/CS2 and a lower temperature to achieve better approach to 
equilibrium for H2S/SO2. The reaction rate in Reactor 2 is low owing to the lower H2S/SO2
 concen-
tration. Only a small amount of remaining H2S/SO2 is converted in Reactor 3.

version increases gradually within the following ranges as the number of reac-
tors is increased: two reactors 94–96%; three reactors 96–98%; four reactors 97–
98.5%.  
A number of tail gas treatments have been developed to increase sulfur re-
covery efficiency to more than 99%:37  
 
• Cold bed absorption involves adding two additional Claus reactors in 
parallel, operating below the dew point of sulphur at 1200–1400C. The 
equilibrium conversion to sulphur is favoured at the lower temperature, 
but sulphur condenses in the pores of the catalyst, leading to temporary 
deactivation. Thus, when one bed is saturated, ﬂow is switched to the par-
allel bed while the ﬁrst is regenerated at 3000C. Up to 99% conversion 
can be achieved.  
• All residual sulfur compounds in tail gas are hydrogenated in a bed of co-
balt/molybdate/alumina catalyst, operated at 3000C, after the addition of a 
suitable volume of hydrogen to the Claus reactor tail gas. The hydrogen 
sulﬁde formed can then be recycled to the Claus process furnace. This 
treatment improves conversion up to 99.9%.  
• Alternatively, after hydrogenation of sulfur compounds, the residual hy-
drogen sulﬁde can be selectively oxidized to sulfur. A suitable catalyst is 
5–6% ferric oxide supported on low-surface-area, high-pore-volume sili-
ca. During reaction the iron oxide is converted to ferrous sulfate. Conver-
sions of up to 99.9% are possible, but if the hydrogenation step is omit-
ted, only the residual hydrogen sulﬁde is oxidized and overall sulphur re-
covers depends on the volume of residual carbon oxysulﬁde and carbon 
disulﬁde in tail gas.  
 
2.3.3.  Claus Process Catalysts  
 
The Claus plants built by A. M. Chance in 1887 used ﬁrebrick impregnated with 
an iron salt as the catalyst. Claus’ original idea probably originated from the use 
in the United Kingdom of bog iron ore, a form of hydrated iron oxide, to remove 
hydrogen sulﬁde from town gas. During use, the bog iron ore was converted to a 
mixture of iron sulﬁdes and free sulfur. Additional free sulfur could then be 
formed by exposing a partly spent oxide absorbent to air in a series of regenera-
tions. After several reviviﬁcations, spent oxide contained up to 50 wt% sulfur, 
which blocked gas ﬂow through the bed. The mass could then be used as a 
source of sulfur in sulfuric acid production:  
 
 
   
Fe2O3xH2O + 3 H2S → Fe2S3 + 4 H2O 
(2.19) 
 
 
   
Fe2S3 + 1.5 O2 → 3 S + Fe2O3 
(2.20) 
 
46 
Chapter 2 
 
Overall this corresponded to the Claus reaction:  
 
   
3 H2S + 1.5 O2 → 3 S + 3 H2O 
(2.21) 
 
Claus felt that the cyclic process could be simpliﬁed if the hydrogen sulﬁde 
were converted to sulfur by an iron catalyst in a kiln. It was later found that 
dried Weldon process mud or bauxite would operate as a catalyst at a lower 
temperature than ferric oxide. This not only extended the life of the kiln but also 
increased sulfur yield.39 Problems with blocked beds were overcome as technol-
ogy evolved and proper reactors containing solid catalyst particles were devel-
oped. Thus, the modern Claus sulfur recovery process originated from the statu-
tory obligation to remove sulfur from town gas in Victorian gas works.  
Different catalysts were used when the Claus process was reintroduced in 
reﬁneries in 1940–1950. Bauxite, for example, which was already available in 
reﬁneries to hydrodesulfurize straight-run naphthas, is a variable mixture of 
gibbsite and boehmite with iron and silica impurities. When calcined to activate 
the alumina, it is converted to a catalyst with about 1–12% ferric oxide support-
ed on γ-alumina. Bauxite catalysts were successfully used in the Claus process, 
giving a sulfur conversion greater than 90%.38 
Eventually, sulfur recovery was introduced on a larger scale, particularly in 
Canada, and higher conversion was required to limit sulfur emission.40 Pure ac-
tivated alumina catalysts were then introduced in the form of strong spheres that 
improved gas ﬂow and reduced pressure drop. Alumina catalysts are still the 
most widely used and give excellent results under normal conditions. However, 
more stable and active catalysts are needed in some plants,41 where they have 
been shown to operate more successfully in the presence of residual oxygen and 
to be particularly active for the conversion of carbon oxysulﬁde and carbon di-
sulﬁde.42 
The formation of carbon oxysulﬁde and carbon disulﬁde in the furnace 
leads to problems when high overall conversion is required. Alumina catalysts 
are not sufﬁciently active to convert carbon disulfide and oxysulfide in the ﬁrst 
reactor unless a high temperature is reached at the bottom of the bed. When this 
is not possible, the bottom third of the bed can be loaded with either an iron-
promoted alumina or a newer titania catalyst. Cobalt/molybdate/alumina cata-
lysts were also tested in early attempts to hydrogenate the impurities, but it was 
found that conditions in the ﬁrst reactor favored sulfur dioxide hydrogenation 
instead. All of the catalyst types used in Claus sulfur recovery plants are de-
scribed in Tables 2.10 and 2.11.

gen sulﬁde conversion. High temperatures favor the removal of carbon sulfides 
and lower temperatures favor sulfur formation. 
There are several typical catalyst operating problems. The most common is 
the deposition of elemental sulfur in the catalyst pores at low temperature. Alu-
mina catalysts are soon saturated with sulfur if the operating temperature is less 
than 2700C. The macro pore volume of catalysts should, therefore, be high, and 
have the smallest particle size possible, consistent with a reasonable pressure 
drop at maximum space velocity. This increases the rate of diffusion in and 
around the catalyst particles. Operating temperature in the ﬁrst reactor should 
also be high enough to increase the rate of reaction and avoid sulfur  deposition.

During normal operation the ﬁrst reactor catalyst will not normally contain more 
than about 5–10 wt% of sulfur.  
possible during start-up or shut-down if the temperature exceeds 5000C in 
the presence of water, and this will reduce activity. If sulfur trioxide forms in the 
furnace from oxidation of sulfur dioxide, it will react with the catalyst to form 
aluminum sulfate, which also reduces catalyst activity.  
The catalyst can also be sulfated at lower temperature by a complex series 
of reactions with sulfur dioxide, and the catalyst can contain up to 3% of com-
bined sulfur under normal operating conditions. It has been suggested that sulfur 
dioxide is strongly chemisorbed by surface hydroxyl groups to give a sulﬁte 
intermediate. This reacts with sulfur vapor to give a thiosulfate intermediate that 
reacts, in turn, with a neighboring hydroxyl to form sulfate. This does not neces-
sarily deactivate the catalyst.  
The presence of even a few hundred parts per million of oxygen, however, 
can cause immediate catalyst deactivation. Sulfate is produced on the active 
sites,42 by interaction with sulfur dioxide resulting in an affect similar to that of 
sulfur trioxide. The effect of sulfation is more severe in the second or third beds, 
which operate at a lower temperature.  
Oxygen poisoning can be reduced to a certain extent by placing a layer of 
alumina containing iron or nickel oxide above the catalyst in the ﬁrst reactor. 
This converted oxygen to water but at high oxygen levels ferrous sulfate was 
formed. A further beneﬁt of these guard catalysts was that a higher proportion of 
any carbon disulﬁde and carbon oxysulﬁde in the gas could be converted.  
Sulfation was more effectively controlled by the use of titania catalysts, 
which were not affected by oxygen concentrations of several thousand parts per 
million. This was partly because the thiosulfate intermediate on titania is unsta-
ble above 1000C, and because surface sulfates on titania are more easily reduced 
with hydrogen sulﬁde.43 This means that a titania surface is free from sulfate, 
whereas sulfate blocks an alumina surface. Further advantages of using titania 
are that it can operate at a higher space velocity than alumina and convert a 
greater proportion of any carbon disulﬁde and carbon oxysulﬁde present.  
2.4.  
AMMONIA SYNTHESIS  
Ammonia, or alkaline air, was isolated by Priestley in 1724, who found that it 
could be decomposed by electric sparks to give an increased volume of an 
inﬂammable gas. Later, it was shown that the decomposition product was a mix-
ture of hydrogen and nitrogen and that the reaction was reversible because 100% 
decomposition was not achieved at the elevated temperature required.44 
Ammonia could be formed when a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen was 
exposed to electric sparks. Ramsay and Young also found that traces of ammo-
nia formed when hydrogen and nitrogen were passed over a heated plati-

num/titania catalyst on a porous support. Hlavati and the Christiania Minekom-
panie in Norway both produced some ammonia using a supported titanium cata-
lyst, with or without platinum, and disclosed the use of supported catalysts con-
taining the oxides of antimony and bismuth, and alkali or alkaline earths con-
taining small amounts of platinum.45 Dufresne (alias Charles Tellier) demon-
strated the production of ammonia in a cyclic process by heating spongy titan-
iferrous iron alternately with nitrogen and hydrogen and suggested operation at 
10 atm pressure.46 A similar cyclic process, devised by De Motay, reacted red-
hot titanium nitrides alternately with hydrogen and nitrogen.47 
Le Chatelier began to work on the high-pressure formation of ammonia in 
1901, but discontinued his experiments following a serious explosion.48 
By 1900 
it was thought that it should be possible to synthesize ammonia from its ele-
ments, but it was not yet known whether a suitable industrial process using cata-
lysts could be developed.  
 
2.4.1.  Sir William Crookes  
 
Both Liebig, in the book he published in 1840,49 and Lawes, in his work at 
Rothamsted in 1845,49 recognised that nitrogeneous substances such as ammonia 
or nitrate were essential for healthy plant growth. Lawes, in particular, stressed 
that additional nitrogen in the form of mineral fertilisers would be required. The 
nitrogen problem had become widely recognised as a serious issue towards the 
end of the nineteenth century, since by 1890, it was clear that the available quan-
tities of sodium nitrate from Chile, Chile saltpeter, would not be sufﬁcient to 
meet the anticipated future demand. It was equally clear that other sources of 
supply would soon be required.  
It is therefore not surprising that Sir William Crookes chose this subject for 
his presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence in Bristol in 1898.50 He had already demonstrated his ﬂame of burning ni-
trogen in 1892 by combining the nitrogen and oxygen in air to form nitrogen 
oxides at high temperatures. He appealed to chemists for other, more economic 
and practicable methods to ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen to supply the fertilizers 
needed to produce feed for a growing world population.  
The direct production of nitric oxide from air at high temperatures in an 
electric arc by the Birkeland and Eyde or Cyanamide processes was feasible, but 
could only be used in locations with abundant and cheap hydroelectric power. 
This clearly was not the long  term answer, and a series of signiﬁcant  advances 
initiated by Ostwald at Leipzig, following discussions with William Pfeffer, 
soon followed. Ostwald, himself, worked on the catalytic synthesis of ammonia, 
and its oxidation to nitric acid.

2.4.2.  Development of the Ammonia Synthesis Process  
 
Despite all the preliminary investigations, the production of ammonia using cat-
alysts on an industrial scale was not possible until 1913 at Oppau, because it was 
not until then that the reaction was properly understood, a practical catalyst had 
been developed and suitable equipment available. The ammonia process resulted 
from the theoretical and experimental work of Ostwald, Nernst, and, particular-
ly, Haber, who, with a number of associates, began a systematic investigation of 
the reaction over a wide range of temperatures and pressures to determine the 
equilibrium constants. Haber also measured the activity of a number of different 
catalysts.51  
Ammonia synthesis has been described as the ﬁrst example where the 
knowledge of thermodynamics led research to the most practicable industrial 
process.52 
We now know from the thermodynamics of the reaction that the for-
mation of ammonia is favoured by low temperatures and high pressures. It was 
thus possible to devise the conditions required for economic operation at low 
equilibrium conversion and then to develop a catalyst and the high-pressure 
equipment that was not available at the time.  
Ostwald produced ammonia in laboratory experiments at atmospheric pres-
sure using an iron wire catalyst and claimed that he obtained a relatively high 
yield.53 He had, however, nitrided the iron during its pretreatment with ammonia 
and withdrew his patent application. From about 1904, Haber and a group of co-
workers, funded by the Margulies brothers from Vienna, began to investigate the 
equilibrium conversions in the ammonia synthesis reaction using an iron catalyst 
at the Technical University of Karlsruhe. Although the conversion at atmospher-
ic pressure was too low for an industrial process, it was known that conversion 
could be increased at higher pressure. Nernst, who used theoretical calculations 
to query some of Haber’s early experimental results, experimented with Jost at 
pressures up to 75 atm.54 He used catalysts including iron and manganese, but 
felt that the process would still not be commercially attractive because the con-
version to ammonia was less than 1%. Haber, however, was more optimistic due 
to his experience with osmium and uranium carbide catalysts. He realised that 
despite the low equilibrium constant, the process could work at high pressures, 
and he achieved up to 6% ammonia in the gas stream in experiments at 200 bar. 
This suggested that a process could be feasible provided that the synthesis gas 
was recycled continuously in a loop and that the product ammonia was removed 
from the synthesis gas after each cycle through the catalyst. The patents, which 
were issued in 1908 and 1909, had many of the features of the modern process, 
including the recirculation of synthesis gas and the use of heat exchange be-
tween the gases leaving and entering the reactor.55

2.4.3. Commercial Application of Ammonia Synthesis Catalysts  
 
The commercial process was developed after 1910 when Haber began his col-
laboration with BASF. Carl Bosch, who was in charge of the development, be-
gan to look for an efﬁcient, cheaper catalyst. Osmium could be operated suc-
cessfully at 5500–6000C and 175–200 atm giving an ammonia conversion up to 
6%. It was, however, expensive, poisonous, unstable in air, and, more important, 
almost unobtainable. These were not the qualities required for an industrial cata-
lyst. Furthermore, the iron reactor then available was found to suffer from hy-
drogen embrittlement under operating conditions and could explode. Uranium, 
the other active catalyst favored by Haber, was also expensive and, unfortunate-
ly, was rapidly poisoned by traces of water and oxygen in the synthesis gas.  
One of the ﬁrst innovations made by Bosch was the introduction of a com-
prehensive program of catalyst testing using thirty specially designed laboratory 
units. These are described as using only 2g of catalyst—a tremendous achieve-
ment in those days. Alvin Mittasch was in charge of the testing program.56  
It was thought that iron would be the best catalyst, despite its relatively poor 
activity in earlier investigations. In one of the fortunate coincidences that are 
typical of industrial developments, a particular kind of magnetite from Sweden 
that Mittasch found in his laboratory was used in the tests. It gave excellent re-
sults and, even now, is used for industrial catalyst production. It will continue to 
be so until a better catalyst is discovered or the particular deposit in Sweden is 
exhausted.56  
An intensive investigation of catalyst promoters was then undertaken, and 
by 1910 an alumina-promoted iron catalyst was produced that had the same ac-
tivity as the previously favored osmium and uranium types. This was followed 
in 1911 by an alumina/potash-promoted iron catalyst that was more stable.57 
Finally, a few years later, calcium oxide was discovered to be a third promoter.  
During tests full-scale operating procedures were worked out and catalyst 
poisons, including sulfur compounds, chlorides, phosphates, arsenic, and rela-
tively common oxygen compounds such as water and carbon monoxide, were 
identiﬁed. By 1922, when several full-scale ammonia plants were operating, a 
total of about 20,000 tests had been completed!58  
Despite the novelty of the new process, a small pilot plant was rapidly con-
structed in 1909 so that metallurgical and operating problems could be investi-
gated. The ﬁrst full-scale, 30-tons.day-1 , ammonia plant was then built at Oppau 
in 1912 and was operating by 1913. By 1916 production had been increased to 
250 tonnes.day-1 and a further plant was operating at Leuna with a capacity of 
36,000 tonnes.year-1, which had increased to 240,000 tonnes.year-1 by 1918. An 
early ammonia synthesis converter is shown in Figure 2.5.

Therefore, additional heat had to be supplied to the catalyst bed and this was 
done in a number of ways:  
• In early units the reactor was heated externally, by gas burners, although 
this had the disadvantage of further weakening the shell.  
• A special air burner at the top of the catalyst bed could increase the gas 
temperature and was used until 1922, despite the poisoning effect of wa-
ter on the catalyst.  
• Larger reactors only used a gas heater at start-up with reverse gas ﬂow to 
avoid catalyst poisoning.  
• From 1920 better steel alloys that resisted embrittlement became availa-
ble.  
By 1925, new reactors had been developed by using improved chromium/ 
vanadium steel alloys and internal heat exchangers. The outer shell was protect-
ed from overheating by passing the cold synthesis gas down the annular space 
between the shell and the catalyst basket as it entered the vessel. A typical plant 
was operated with the catalyst temperature in the range 5000–6500C and at a 
higher pressure, up to 300–350 atm, which allowed higher conversion and easier 
ammonia removal by water scrubbing. While these conditions should give a 
theoretical conversion in the range 8–11%, the actual conversion was only 7–
9%.  
A reactor, producing 20 tons.day-1 of ammonia weighed about 70 tonnes, 
was 12 m long, and held a basket of 80 cm internal diameter. It took about 3 
days to change a deactivated catalyst and restart operation. In those days, in or-
der to increase production, typical ammonia plants operated with several small 
reactors rather than a single large one.  
 
2.4.5. Conclusion  
 
The production of ammonia during the early 1900s stimulated the increasing use 
of industrial catalysts. Development of the synthesis catalyst set a pattern for all 
other catalysts subsequently used in chemical and reﬁning processes.  
Theoretical and experimental effort had shown that the process was feasi-
ble. This was followed by the development of practical equipment and full-scale 
operation. A relatively cheap and reliable catalyst was thoroughly tested and 
produced economically in what were then large volumes. Finally, both the pro-
cess and catalyst were gradually improved as the scale of operation expanded.  
The pioneering work of Haber, Bosch, and Mittasch led to a process which 
has survived in more or less the same form as it is used today. Their achieve-
ment led to the introduction of chemical engineering, high pressure technology 
and consolidated the ideas of unit processes. New materials were developed for 
use with hydrogen at high pressures.  
 
The First Catalysts 
55 
 
From 1940, when synthesis gas ﬁrst was produced from natural gas rather 
than coal, single-stream ammonia plants were developed and the process was 
subject to an ongoing series of improvements. Improved catalysts based on the 
same natural magnetite were made as the internal structure of magnetite and the 
function of the promoters could be investigated with modern analytical proce-
dures. Catalyst life with purer synthesis gas can now exceed 15 years.  
Although better reactor designs were introduced, the use of almost 200 
tonnes of catalyst in a single vessel led to problems with packing, activation, and 
pressure drop. Furthermore, spent catalyst is very pyrophoric and large volumes 
of spent catalyst are difﬁcult to deal with. Catalyst reduction could last for al-
most a week, so the ﬁrst modern catalyst innovation was prereduction and stabi-
lisation of the catalyst before it was loaded into the converter. This made plant 
start-up more efﬁcient. Attempts to provide a more uniform, pelletted catalyst 
were not successful and crushed granules are still used.  
Since the early 1980s there have been several catalyst developments, in-
cluding the use of cobalt oxide with magnetite to increase activity. The most 
signiﬁcant, however, is the successful use of a ruthenium catalyst supported on a 
special carbon and promoted with cesium and barium. Although still expensive, 
cost and availability should not restrict the use of ruthenium in the way that os-
mium was excluded by Bosch, provided that the metal is recycled.  
2.5. COAL HYDROGENATION  
2.5.1. The Bergius Process  
 
Bergius began his experiments on the high-pressure hydrogenation of coal using 
small autoclave reactors as early as 1911. His aim was to increase the yield of 
liquid products from coal carbonization and, like Ipatieff, he worked at the time 
that BASF was developing its new high-pressure ammonia process. By 1921 he 
had built a small, continuous, semitechnical unit at Reinau/Mannheim with hori-
zontal stirred reactors and was obtaining encouraging results. These units oper-
ated until 1927.59  
In the plant, a slurry of coal and heavy oil was hydrogenated using about 4 
wt% luxmasse as the catalyst. Luxmasse, which is rich in iron with some titania, 
is the residue from bauxite after alumina extraction. Hydrogenation conditions 
were in the range 4500–4800C and 100–150 atm of hydrogen, yielding 40–50 
wt% of liquid hydrocarbons, depending on the type of feed used. Residual solids 
and heavy oils could be recycled.  
Bergius certainly recognised the relationship between his work and the cata-
lytic hydrogenation of heavy crude oil fractions, relative to the newly introduced 
thermal cracking.60 Thermal cracking of crude oil fractions was ﬁrst used in 
reﬁneries around 1911–1912 to increase the yield of gasoline. By about 1924 the 
56 
Chapter 2 
 
thermal cracking process was an essential part of reﬁnery operation, particularly 
in the United States, where more than 25 million motor vehicles were registered. 
The attraction of a more efﬁcient catalytic process was obvious and led big oil 
companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, who apparently funded some of Bergius’ 
work, and Standard Oil, who later worked with I. G. Farben, to take a keen in-
terest at a time when crude oil reserves were thought to be declining.  
 
2.5.2. Commercial Development by I. G. Farben  
 
In 1920 after the war, demand for synthetic ammonia had fallen and Bosch felt 
that the high-pressure ammonia plant at Leuna might be converted to hydrogen-
ate coal. Experimental work began at Oppau, and the Bergius patent rights were 
acquired in 1925, at the time that I. G. Farben was formed. Soon afterward I. G. 
Farben decided to convert the plant at Leuna to produce 100,000 tons.year-1 of 
oil products. Operation started in June 1927, but it was some time before the 
technical problems were sorted out and the plant could be operated successfully. 
Costs were therefore extremely high and operation was stopped. The plant was 
restarted in 1931, when plans were made to treble capacity and to build three 
more plants in other parts of Germany in 1935.61  
 
I. G. Farben needed to develop efﬁcient, sulfur-resistant catalysts and to 
improve the process. Two converters were operated in series. Light oils formed 
in the ﬁrst converter were removed by distillation before further hydrogenation 
of the residue took place in the second converter.  
 
2.5.3. Cooperation between I. G. Farben and Standard Oil  
 
I. G. Farben and Standard Oil began to talk about coal hydrogenation in 1925, 
and in 1927 they signed an agreement to cooperate in the research and develop-
ment of oil hydrogenation. At that time, Standard Oil decided to build two gas 
oil hydrogenation units, each with a production capacity of 40,000 tons.year-1 of 
petrol, solvents, lube oil, and kerosene at Baytown, New Jersey, and Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana.62 Hydrogen for these plants was to be made in the ﬁrst com-
mercial hydrocarbon steam reformers using a process and catalyst developed by 
I. G. Farben. Standard Oil planned to use the low-molecular-weight waste gases 
from the hydrogenation process as the hydrocarbon feed to the steam reformers. 
Standard Oil acquired the world rights to oil hydrogenation in 1928.  
 
2.5.4. Commercial Developments by ICI  
 
There was, of course, a worldwide interest in producing gasoline by coal hy-
drogenation, and those companies which developed ammonia processes were 
able to establish production facilities. In 1927, ICI acquired the patent rights of 
 
The First Catalysts 
57 
 
the British Bergius syndicate and started to work independently on the coal hy-
drogenation process. To suit local conditions it was decided to modify operation 
and produce gasoline from bituminous coal. Coal was chosen because tar, the 
preferred feed, was not readily available in the quantities needed. A large pilot 
plant was built by 1929 and was in operation until 1931, by which time it had 
been established that at least 60 wt% of gasoline could be produced from coal. A 
full-scale plant was then designed to start operating in 1935 to produce a nomi-
nal 100,000 tons.year-1 of gasoline.63 
 
2.5.5. International Cooperation  
 
In 1931 the four major companies interested in the hydrogenation process—  
I. G. Farben, Standard Oil (New Jersey), Royal Dutch Shell, and ICI—became 
associated in the International Hydrogenation Patents Company to pool their 
patent rights and exchange technical information.63 
 
 
2.5.6. Coal Hydrogenation Processes  
 
Coal hydrogenation processes were being developed at a time when there was 
no known theory of catalysis. High-pressure equipment was not generally avail-
able and was, therefore, very expensive. For special applications, potential oper-
ators had to design reactors and valves themselves. For these reasons progress in 
developing coal hydrogenation in the 1920s was fairly slow. However, because 
of the continuing fears that crude oil supplies would decline, work on the project 
went ahead and a range of new catalysts was developed. The most active chemi-
cal companies in Europe were I. G. Farben in Germany and ICI in the United 
Kingdom, and they were also working on a wide range of other catalytic pro-
cesses at the time. Similarly, the international oil companies Standard Oil of 
New Jersey and Royal Dutch Shell were also introducing new catalytic process-
es for use in reﬁneries.  
These activities made signiﬁcant contributions to both sides during World 
War II for the production of aviation gasoline. Subsequently rapid developments 
led to many other chemical and reﬁnery processes based on catalysts. These are 
listed in Table 2.13.  
Table 2.14 shows the total production of oil products in Germany and avia-
tion gasoline in the United Kingdom by catalytic hydrogenation of coal or creo-
sote from 1935 to 1946.  
 
It was found during pilot plant testing that maximum yields of liquid hydro-
carbons could only be obtained if the coal, or later tar and creosote, was partly

hydrogenated as a slurry in one reactor and the conversion completed by vapor 
phase hydrogenation in a second reactor. Operating conditions and the catalysts 
used depended on the feed to the process and whether the product required was a 
mixture of oil products or simply gasoline.  
 
2.5.6.1. The I. G. Farben Process  
 
The I. G. Farben process was used to produce mixed oils.64 Originally the coal, 
slurried with heavy oil and a molybdenum catalyst, was hydrogenated at 4000C 
and 200 atm. Light and middle oils were then separated. The residue was again 
hydrogenated at 4500–4700C and 200 atm, this time with a cobalt sulﬁde cata-
lyst, to produce more light and middle oils. Residual heavy oil was recycled as a 
slurry with more coal. About 75% of the coal was converted into useful light 
and middle oils. Eventually I. G. Farben used sulﬁded iron catalysts at 700 atm 
to achieve higher conversion.

2.5.6.2. The ICI Process  
 
ICI produced gasoline.65 Coal was slurried with heavy oil (bp > 4000C) and 2% 
of an iron oxide catalyst (later an improved stannous oxalate catalyst was used) 
and hydrogenated at 4200C and 250 atm. During operation in the tall, narrow 
reactor the slurry was agitated by the upward ﬂow of hydrogen. The ratio of 
hydrogen to slurry was about 1000, with a residence time of up to 2 h.  
The liquid product was separated into gasoline (< 2000C), middle oil (2000– 
3000C), and heavy oil (> 3000C) fractions. Heavy oil was recycled with more 
coal to the ﬁrst reactor for further hydrogenation. Middle oil was then hydrogen-
ated in a second, vapor phase reactor at 4800C and 250 atm with 1 m3 of hydro-
gen per kg of oil at a residence time of 3 min. The catalyst was pelletted tung-
sten sulﬁde. Gasoline was again separated and the residual middle oil recycled. 
The yield from both stages exceeded 60 kg of gasoline per 100 kg of coal.  ICI 
operated  two stages at  240–260 atm: stage 1 to convert either coal,  a heavy oil 
slurry, or heavy creosote to middle oil that was then cracked in stage 2 to pro-
duce gasoline. Details are shown in Table 2.15.

2.5.7. Catalysts for Coal Hydrogenation  
 
Originally Bergius felt that coal hydrogenation could not be catalyzed because 
the large quantities of sulfur present would poison the catalysts. He added 
luxmasse simply to absorb sulfur from the products although, coincidentally, the 
combination of iron oxide with titania and alumina was an excellent choice of 
catalyst. Since his ﬁrst tests, however, the industrial use of the process has de-
pended on catalysts that were developed more or less empirically. It was soon 
realized that the processes involved in hydrogenating coal were more complex 
than the simple reactions described by Sabatier and Ipatieff. Different catalysts 
such as iron oxide or iron sulﬁde, probably with traces of other metal oxides, 
were required. These catalysts could be used in the presence of sulfur and were, 
in fact, even more active when sulﬁded.66 Several studies reported that iron, 
nickel, cobalt, tin, zinc, and copper chlorides were effective catalysts and 
claimed that ammonium molybdate was particularly active.  
An early I. G. Farben patent64 used a molybdenum catalyst in the ﬁrst stage 
of the hydrogenation, probably based on a 31 ZnO:15 MgO:54 MoO3 mixture, 
and a cobalt sulﬁde catalyst in the second stage. At about the same time ICI used 
an iron oxide or tin-plated iron catalyst in the ﬁrst, liquid phase reactor.65 ICI 
subsequently used stannous oxalate in their ﬁrst reactor with the addition of 
ammonium chloride to neutralize the alkaline ash and maintain catalyst activity. 
Alkalinity was a common problem with all coal feeds and, eventually, I. G. Far-
ben plants opted to increase operating pressure to 700 atm, which allowed them 
to use a simple iron catalyst which was more resistant to alkali. Later they also 
used sulfuric acid to neutralize the alkalinity. Until 1935 the preferred vapor 
phase hydrogenation catalysts used in the second reactor seemed to be the zinc 
oxide/magnesia/molybdena catalyst. This could only operate at high tempera-
tures and gave relatively low liquid yields with correspondingly high levels of 
gas formation.  
By 1930 I. G. Farben had introduced a new tungsten sulﬁde catalyst that 
was extremely active in both the cracking and hydrogenation stages of the pro-
cess and produced high yields with all feeds. A disadvantage was that often sul-
fur had to be added to resulﬁde the catalyst. Despite the higher proportion of 
gasoline produced compared with early catalysts, the octane number (68–70) 
was low, because the use of tungsten sulﬁde results in a decreased aromatic con-
tent. When higher-octane gasolines were required, the pure tungsten sulﬁde cata-
lyst was modiﬁed to 10% tungsten sulﬁde supported on activated montmorillo-
nite (Terrana clay). The new catalyst was just as active but produced gasoline 
with an increased octane number.  
It was found, however, that the catalyst was poisoned by feeds containing 
more than 5 ppm of nitrogen. This meant that it could only be used directly with 
crude oil fractions and not with coal or coal tars. Nitrogen poisoning could be 
avoided by partial hydrogenation of the feed over tungsten sulﬁde at a low tem-

2.6. THE FISCHER–TROPSCH PROCESS  
The possibility of producing fuels from carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syn-
thesis gas) was investigated as far back as 1913 using alkali-activated cobalt and 
osmium oxide catalysts supported on asbestos. A mixture of alcohols, alde-
hydes, ketones, and fatty acids with some aliphatic hydrocarbons was produced 
at 3000–4000C and 100–200 atm. The work was, of course, also stimulated by 
the development of high-pressure equipment and the production of synthesis gas 
by BASF.67 From 1923 Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch continued work on 
what they called the Synthol process at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute at Mulheim-
Ruhr. Using alkalized iron turnings as a catalyst, they were able to produce Syn-
thin, an oily liquid at 4000–4500C and 100–150 atm. At high pressures the oil 
produced by the Synthol catalyst consisted mainly of oxygenated compounds 
but further experiments at about 7 atm did provide a mixture of oleﬁns and par-
afﬁns. Nickel and cobalt catalysts also produced methane and higher hydrocar-
bons at atmospheric pressure and 2000–2500C, but the catalysts were quickly 
deactivated under these conditions. As all the tests with nickel and cobalt cata-
lysts were carried out at atmospheric pressure, on the assumption that this gave 
the most desirable product, iron catalysts, which operated more effectively at 
higher pressure, were excluded.  
Full reviews of the early work are given by Robert Anderson68 and H. H. 
Storch.69 The synthesis of hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon monoxide 
synthesis gas by Fischer, Tropsch, and their associates became known as the 
Fischer–Tropsch process. This has been used and developed extensively since 
1955 by Sasol, in South Africa, where it is still known as the Synthol process.  
Fischer and Tropsch went on to test a number of catalysts based on nickel 
and cobalt supported on thoria and kieselguhr, which were considered more 
promising than iron. Their experimental work is a classic example of catalyst 
and process development that has probably since been followed by many other 
investigators.  
Catalyst preparation evolved through the use of the mixed metal oxides, the 
decomposition of mixed metal nitrates, and the precipitation of carbonates and 
hydroxides from solutions of metal salts. Because powders were difﬁcult to han-
dle, granules and pellets were produced using binders and tested in a variety of 
shapes and sizes.  
The ﬁrst promising catalyst was introduced by 1931 and contained a high 
proportion of nickel oxide supported on a mixture of thoria and kieselguhr. The 
convention widely used at the time was to describe composition as 100 parts 
nickel, 18 parts thoria, 100 parts kieselguhr. Catalysts made with cobalt rather 
than nickel were more effective but could not be considered commercially at 
that time because cobalt was not available in sufﬁciently large quantities. The 
same problem had, of course, faced Haber and Bosch in the replacement of os-
mium by iron oxide for the ammonia synthesis catalyst.  
64 
Chapter 2 
 
A disadvantage with the nickel catalyst, which was active but less selective 
than cobalt in the reaction, is its short operating life. One reason for this may 
have been the need to activate the catalyst by reduction at 4500C before use. The 
reason for this short lifetime is that nickel silicates are formed during catalyst 
preparation by reaction of the nickel compound with kieselguhr. These can only 
be reduced at the relatively high temperature of 4500C. Nickel crystallites are 
very prone to sintering at this temperature and the catalysts are somewhat deac-
tivated even before they are charged to the reactor. Silicate formation during 
catalyst preparation has been a continuing problem with nickel/kieselguhr hy-
drogenation catalysts. A small amount of copper was added to allow catalyst 
reduction at a temperature closer to the operating level of 1780C. Unfortunately, 
the copper also sintered and catalyst activity was actually decreased.  
Subsequent work included attempts to use less of the more expensive mate-
rials in the catalyst recipe and to replace them with cheaper diluents. This was 
done empirically adding manganese oxide, magnesia, and more kieselguhr. Alt-
hough it was a novel approach at the time, it is now a routine procedure in cut-
ting the cost of a catalyst!  
Ruhrchemie built a large pilot plant in 1934 and tested a 100Ni:25MnO: 
10Al2O3:100 kieselguhr formulation. This approach demonstrated another im-
portant stage in catalyst development, namely that small-scale atmospheric pres-
sure tests do not highlight full-scale operating problems. In this case the problem 
was the need for efﬁcient heat removal from exothermic reactions. The pilot 
plant also conﬁrmed that although nickel was not very selective, deactivation 
could be partly restored by regeneration in air and rereduction in hydrogen at 
4000C. A further problem was an unacceptable loss of nickel during operation, 
presumably as a result of nickel carbonyl formation.  
Roelen70 took over the responsibility for catalyst development in 1934 and 
began further testing of the previously successful cobalt catalyst used by Fisch-
er. He decreased the quantity of expensive materials and also investigated the 
effects of copper on reduction temperature. The catalyst developed by Roelen, 
100Co:5ThO2:8 MgO:200 kieselguhr, was used in the four large plants built by 
Ruhrchemie in 1936 and operated during the war. By the end of the war nine 
plants were using the catalyst with a capacity of about 700,000 tonnes of hydro-
carbons per year.  
The introduction of magnesia to what seems an already complicated mix-
ture is interesting mainly because it was also included in other nickel catalysts 
such as the raschig-ring catalysts for steam reforming. It is now realized that the 
molecular dimensions of magnesia are similar to those of cobalt and nickel ox-
ides, and that magnesium can replace cobalt and nickel in solid solution within a 
crystalline lattice. This can make catalyst reduction easier and result in the for-
mation of smaller, more stable metal crystallites.  
Research on precipitated iron catalysts continued while the ﬁrst commercial 
plants were being built as part of the program to ﬁnd a cheaper catalyst. Results

were not encouraging until the operating pressure was raised to 15 atm.71 This 
increased both the hydrocarbon yield and the catalyst life. Several catalysts, in-
cluding a typical fused ammonia synthesis catalyst, were compared in 1936 in a 
government competition at Schwarzheide. Different promoters were tested, and 
potash was found to increase activity and selectivity. Later, in 1940 Pichler and 
Buffeg tested supported ruthenium catalysts at pressures up to 1000 atm and 
obtained high-molecular-weight waxes.72 
 
2.6.1.  Postwar Development of the Synthol Process by Sasol  
 
There was no further full-scale operation of the wartime plants after 1946. How-
ever, experimental work continued in the United States and the United Kingdom 
as well as in Germany because of possible future oil shortages. The lack of oil in 
South Africa had led Anglovaal to take out a license for the construction of a 
Fischer– Tropsch plant in 1935,73 but owing to various delays the plant was not 
actually built until 1955, when Sasol, which was owned by the South African 
Government, went ahead with the project. The Sasol 1 plant, at Sasolburg, pro-
duced up to 200,000 tonnes.year-1 of hydrocarbons using two processes. The 
ﬁrst, licensed by Lurgi and Ruhrchemie, used ﬁxed bed tube-cooled ARGE reac-
tors, containing a precipitated iron/copper/silica catalyst to provide heavy liquid 
hydrocarbons and waxes. The second, licensed by Kellogg, operated with a cir-
culating ﬂuid bed of crushed fused iron catalyst and made hydrocarbon gases 
and gasoline.74  
The ﬁxed bed process worked well. It was not easy, however, to circulate 
the ﬂuidized dense iron catalyst through the reactor and back through the separa-
tor without further development. Good operation was eventually made possible 
and the process was successful in the Sasol Synthol reactor. Typical product 
distributions for the two processes are shown in Table 2.16.  
Early catalysts used in the Synthol process were produced as follows:74  
a) Ruhrchemie catalyst for the in ﬁxed bed tubular reactor:  
• Solutions of cobalt, thorium, and magnesium nitrates were added to a so-
dium carbonate solution up to pH 7.  
• Kieselguhr was added and the slurry ﬁltered, dried, washed, and calcined. 
b)  Alternative recipe used by Sasol:  
• Precipitation of basic carbonates and hydroxides from copper and ferric 
nitrate solutions with sodium carbonate solution.  
• Filter and wash precipitate before slurrying the solid with potassium sili-
cate solution to give 25 g SiO2 per 100 g iron.  
• Wash with dilute nitric acid to remove any excess potassium leaving 5 g 
K2O per 100 g iron.  
• Filter and extrude partly dried ﬁlter cake. Dry to less than 10% water. 
• Add other promoters.

c) Fused magnetite catalyst used in transported ﬂuid bed reactors:  
• Fuse magnetite, such as mill-scale, with potash, alumina, silica, and other 
promoters at 15000C.  
• Chill cast molten mass and mill to required size grade.  
• Oxides such as Al2O3, MgO, TiO2, and CrO3 were claimed to form solid 
solutions whereas K2O and SiO2 remained on crystal boundaries. The 
composition was not published.  
• Catalyst must be reduced before use.  
Following the successful development of the Synthol process, Sasol went 
ahead and built two larger plants at Secunda, Sasol 2 and Sasol 3, which were 
based on coal. A further plant using the Synthol reactor but with natural gas as 
feed was built at Mossul Bay by Mossgas.  
The atmospheric pressure adiabatic reactors used during the war by Ruhr-
chemie were not very efﬁcient, and although research on reactor design contin-
ued, nothing could be done at the time to make any improvements. Metal plates, 
7 mm apart, were stacked vertically in the reactor. During operation, the catalyst 
between the plates was cooled by water running through horizontal tubes pass-
ing through the plates. This arrangement was inefﬁcient at the low gas hourly 
space velocity through the catalyst.75  
At the time Ruhrchemie made some minor improvements by using concen-
tric tubes in the medium-pressure reactors, with catalyst in the annular space and 
cooling water ﬂowing around the tube and through the inner space. This was still 
inefﬁcient at low gas space velocity. The ARGE reactors used by Sasol in 1955 
were conventional boiling water tubular reactors with gas recycle to limit heat 
evolution. A typical wartime reactor contained 1250 tubes, whereas the early 
Sasol reactor used more than 2000 tubes.  
Present-day reactor design is much more efﬁcient and, as a result, catalyst 
operation has been improved. The nonadiabatic reactor recently developed by 
UOP is similar to the original Ruhrchemie design, with the catalyst packed be-

tween the vertical plates of a heat exchanger.75 
This allows the feed and coolant 
to ﬂow in any direction to control the temperature more efﬁciently in both exo-
thermic and endothermic reactions. Pressure drop through the catalyst bed can 
also be selected. The advantages are a better approach to reaction equilibrium at 
high rates with better selectivity and less recycle. Nonadiabatic reactors provide 
a good example of how interesting ideas in catalytic processes could not be de-
veloped even 50 years ago because the technology was not available.  
Fluid bed operation proved to be difﬁcult in the original trials held by Stan-
dard Oil and Hydrocarbon Research Incorporated in the United States.77 
The 
main problems were obtaining a uniform density throughout the bed and proper 
gas mixing. The circulating ﬂuid bed used by Kellogg and developed at Sasol 
eventually operated very well. Operating conditions for both Sasol processes are 
summarized below:74  
a) Fixed bed tubular reactor:  
• Reactor with more than 2000 tubes, each 12 m long, containing 20 liters 
of catalyst per tube.  
• Operating pressure 27 atm, temperature 220–2500C. Fresh feed (1.8 H2 : 1 
CO) at space velocity 500 h–1.  
• Initial conversion 40% per pass.  
• Catalyst life less than 1 year, depending on operating severity (e.g., to 
produce high-molecular-weight wax.) The catalyst sinters in the presence 
of water. Prereduction provides preshrinkage of the catalyst. Preshrinkage 
is also possible by heating the catalyst in liquid wax.  
b) Transported ﬂuid bed:  
• Reactor 46 m high (original design 2.3 m internal diameter).  
• Operating pressure 22 atm; reactor outlet temperature about 3400C. Fresh 
feed 100,000 m3 h–1 (6 H2 : 1 CO).  
• Initial conversion 85% per pass.  
• Catalyst life was originally 40 days but now increased.  
• Reduction of catalyst in hydrogen before use at high linear velocity.  
• Catalyst is carbided during reaction with some reoxidation by water pro-
duced during the reaction. Potash promotes carburization and retards oxi-
dation. Alumina increases surface area and activity.  
• Catalyst can be added or removed during operation to improve operation.  
Slurry bed reactors using heavy oil to support the catalyst have been tested 
and can operate over a wider range of operating conditions and feed gas compo-
sitions than the ﬂuid beds.77 
Sasol has now developed an improved Sasol ad-
vanced Synthol (SAS) reactor to produce high-grade distillate. The Sasol slurry 
phase distillate process (SSDP) has been tested in a demonstration plant at Sasol 
1 since 1993. The SAS reactor is said to use an iron-based catalyst similar to the 
one used in its original plants, whereas the SSDP process uses a cobalt catalyst.

The Sasol processes are of interest now that the conversion of synthesis gas-
to-liquid products is being developed by a number of companies. The gas-to-
liquid (GTL) process is of particular interest in the production of sulfur-free 
distillates.  
 
2.6.2.  The Importance of Gas-to-Liquids as Gasoline Prices Increase  
 
The major developments of gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology have arisen due to 
the availability of cheap by-product natural gas or associated gases in remote 
areas. The capital expense of new plants can be offset against future increases in 
crude oil prices. An advantage of the GTL products is the low content of sulfur, 
metals, and other impurities. GTL plants that are currently operating on a large 
scale; the Mossgas process using natural gas, was reported to be using the larg-
est steam-reforming train in the world.  
Since the end of the 1990s several companies have been developing pro-
cesses to supply liquid hydrocarbons. Synthesis gas is produced and treated in 
variations of the Fischer–Tropsch process. High-boiling C10–C40 liquid and wax 
products can be converted to sulfur-free, low-boiling products in the C10–C20 
range by hydrocracking. Since 1955 only the Sasol processes have been tested 
extensively.  
Sasol produces synthesis gas from coal by partial oxidation or from natural 
gas by steam reforming. The ﬁrst version of the Synthol process was upgraded 
to use the advanced Synthol reactor. Both Synthol processes use ﬂuid catalyst 
beds. A new SSDP has now been introduced and should soon be operating. Dis-
tillates and waxes can be produced (25 atm; 2400C).  
Shell operated its middle-distillate synthesis process (SMDS) in Malaysia 
from 1993 to 1997, but closed the facility in 1997 while better Fischer–Tropsch 
catalysts were being developed for future operation. Synthesis gas produced by 
the Shell partial oxidation process was converted to distillates and waxes in a 
tubular high-pressure Fischer–Tropsch reactor. A slurry phase reactor using an 
improved catalyst is being developed (40–46 atm; 120–1300C).  
Exxon developed an advanced gas conversion process (AGC-21) that pro-
duces synthesis gas by combined partial oxidation and steam reforming in a 
ﬂuidized bed. A multiphase, slurry Fischer–Tropsch reactor has also been devel-
oped. Syntroleum uses an autothermal air/natural gas reformer to produce syn-
thesis gas. A ﬂuidized bed Fischer–Tropsch reactor has been developed (20–35 
atm; 190–2300C).  
The catalysts likely to be used in those processes are listed in Table 2.17. It 
is clear that although many innovations will be included, the catalysts will, as far 
as possible, be well-tested types already operating in other processes.78 So far 
only Shell, which is using a cobalt/metallocene catalyst, seems to have devel-
oped something new. Following recovery of the low-boiling, liquid products, the

high-molecularweight hydrocarbons and waxes will be upgraded in hydrocrack-

to be proﬁtable will have to be built on a large scale. However, the recent surges 
in the price of crude oil suggest that more of these processes will become neces-
sary in the future.

HYDROGENATION CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
3.1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGENATION CATALYSTS  
Prior to 1900, catalytic hydrogenation was not really seen as general reaction 
type, and the only examples known were a few speciﬁc, seemingly unrelated, 
reactions of hydrogen with both organic and inorganic compounds. These reac-
tions took place over a reactive surface, which we now know to comprise a cata-
lytic surface. A selection of these reactions is shown in Table 3.1 It was not until 
the early twentieth century that the foundations of catalysis were established, 
initially by the work of Sabatier and Senderens.  
 
3.1.1. Sabatier and Senderens  
 
Modern catalysis began with the systematic hydrogenation of reactive organic 
compounds by Professor Paul Sabatier and Abbe Jean-Baptiste Senderens in 
1897.1 They generally use nickel oxide catalysts to effect addition of hydrogen 
to unsaturated hydrocarbons or to the functional groups of other organic com-
pounds. Reactions were generally carried out in the vapour phase and the effects 
of poisons or anticatalysts noted. This early study continued until about 1920 
and the co-workers who were also involved are listed in Table 3.2  
Sabatier was ﬁrst attracted to the use of nickel as a catalyst when he saw de-
tails of the newly introduced Mond process, in which nickel metal was puriﬁed 
by the formation and decomposition of nickel carbonyl.2 The fact that nickel 
combined with gaseous carbon monoxide suggested that other unsaturated mol-
ecules  might react  in a similar  way.  Sabatier later  described the  methanation

The series of reactions studied by Sabatier led him to formulate new ideas 
on the mechanism of catalytic reactions. He also reached a number of conclu-
sions that were useful in the development of catalytic reactors and industrial 
processes. Some of these conclusions are listed in Table 3.3.

Sabatier was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1912 and be present-
ed his work in the book Catalysis in Organic Chemistry. This was translated into 
English by Professor E E Reid in 1922.4  
 
3.1.2.  The First Industrial Application of Nickel Catalysts  
 
Sabatier did not extend his work to liquid phase hydrogenation, possibly because 
the condensation of liquid on the catalyst surface interfered with the reaction. 
Nevertheless, by 1902 the liquid phase hydrogenation of fatty oils had been in-
troduced on an industrial scale.5 Apart from nickel oxide the catalysts claimed in 
these patents included copper, platinum, and palladium, and were soon being 
supported on inert materials to increase activity.6  
Although Sabatier and Senderens had hydrogenated oleic acid vapor to pro-
duce stearic acid, they did not extend this work themselves.7 
The appendix to 
Chapters 11 and 12 in their book describes early work to about 1916, by others 
who used nickel and palladium catalysts. They described the use of nickel sup-
ported on pumice, kieselguhr, asbestos, and wood charcoal.8  
 
3.1.3.  Ipatieff and High-Pressure Hydrogenation of Liquids  
 
Ipatieff started investigating the hydrogenation of organic molecules at high 
pressure in Russia in about 1901. He knew about high-pressure equipment from 
his experience with explosives as a student in military school. After developing 
an interest in oxide catalysts, he began to work on liquid phase hydrogenation at 
pressures in the range 100–300 atm and temperatures above 2500C. He used 
ﬁnely divided nickel and copper catalysts in a stirred reactor and followed the 
reactions by the change in hydrogen pressure.9 He realized from his experiments 
with different grades of the ﬁnely divided catalysts that the surface area of a 
catalyst was important. The true signiﬁcance of surface area was, of course, only 
realized later.  
76 
Chapter 3 
Ipatieff published a book in 1937 describing his work with catalysts.10 He 
subsequently emigrated to the United States, worked with UOP, and continued 
to make tremendous contributions to the development of catalytic processes 
until the early 1940s. It was noted by Spitz in his very interesting book on the 
petrochemical industry11 that Ipatieff frequently met and discussed catalysis with 
other catalyst researchers, including Sabatier, Caro, Willstatter, Bergius, Haber, 
and Nernst. These meetings obviously led to signiﬁcant progress in catalyst and 
process development. Sabatier, for example, describes Ipatieff’s use of nickel, 
iron, and copper catalysts in Chapter 12 of his own book.  
 
3.1.4.  Colloidal Platinum and Palladium Catalysts by Paal  
 
While Sabatier and Ipatieff were experimenting with nickel and copper catalysts 
others were developing the use of ﬁnely divided platinum and palladium cata-
lysts. The main objective was to achieve a range of more practicable hydrogena-
tion procedures at low pressure in either the gas or the liquid phase.  
Carl Ludwig Paal and others used colloidal platinum and palladium cata-
lysts in liquid phase hydrogenation reactions at low temperatures.12 Aromatic 
and unsaturated aliphatic compounds such as aldehydes or ketones were easily 
hydrogenated by either platinum or palladium. Aladir Skita collaborated with 
Paal in publishing a patent that described some of this work.13 The colloidal 
metals could be stabilized by the use of albumen from egg whites, but they were 
not really practicable and it was difﬁcult to separate them from products. An 
outline of an early colloidal catalyst preparation is given in Table 3.4.  
 
3.1.5.  Platinum and Palladium Black Catalysts by Willstatter  
 
Fokin, who was also interested in precious metal catalysts, had earlier used plat-
inum or palladium blacks to hydrogenate oleic acid at ambient temperature and 
much lower pressures than those used by Ipatieff.14

Paal prepared protalbic acid by dissolving egg albumin in sodium hydroxide solution and

Colloidal metal was obtained by adding sodium salts of the protalbic acid to a dilute solu-
tion of platinum chloride and reducing with hydrazine hydrate. The colloidal solution was 
dialyzed to remove electrolytes and then concentrated.

used for the hydrogenation of a whole range of organic materials by Willstatter, 
of BASF, who noted that some reactions were sensitive to the absence or pres-
ence of oxygen in the catalyst. Although Willstatter initially used an earlier cata-
lyst preparation described by Oscar Loew,15 he eventually evolved a better pro-
cedure himself.16 Details of Loew’s preparation are given in Table 3.5. Paal’s 
method was improved on by Willstatter, who used caustic potash during the 
reduction step.  
 
Continued developments in the use of precious metal catalysts for liquid 
phase reactions led to the introduction of more practical hydrogenation proce-
dures using stirred or agitated reactors at lower pressures. Nevertheless, it was 
found that platinum black had a low and variable activity: 
 
 
Pt Cl4 + 2 HCHO + 2 H2O → Pt0 + 2 HCOOH + 4 HCl  
(3.1) 
 
 
  2 HCOOH + 2 HCl + 4 NaOH → 2 NaCl + 2 HCOONa + 4 H2O  
(3.2) 
 
Full details of the methods of Paal and Willstatter using precious metals and 
of Ipatieff using a range of base metal catalysts including nickel, iron, and cop-
per are given in Chapters 11 and 12 of Sabatier’s book. Many of the reactions 
concerned were eventually developed as industrial processes. Ipatieff investigat-
ed benzene hydrogenation with platinum black in 1912, though the current 
commercial process now uses nickel catalysts.17  
Despite the increasing interest in precious metal catalysts, however, there 
were no signiﬁcant industrial applications of high-pressure organic hydrogena-
tion reactions until almost a generation after Sabatier and Ipatieff began their 
experiments. By that time several other important catalytic industrial processes 
based on high-pressure synthesis gas were being successfully introduced with a 
wide range of new catalysts. These included ammonia synthesis, coal hydro-
genation, the Fischer–Tropsch reaction, and methanol synthesis.

3.1.6.  Adams’ Platinum Oxide  
 
The development of more active and reproducible precious metal catalysts con-
tinued in the 1920s when Roger Adams produced his platinum oxide catalyst by 
the method shown in Table 3.6.18  
Since then Adams’ platinum has been used in the pharmaceutical industry 
and in small-scale hydrogenation reactions. When industrial processes requiring 
precious metal catalysts were developed it was not economic to operate with 
high platinum concentrations. It was, therefore, necessary to reduce costs by 
supporting small amounts of the metal on a suitable diluent. Supports included 
alumina, asbestos, silica gel, and, most often, activated carbon. Products from 
these processes have included vitamins, cortisone, and dihydrostreptomycin.19 
By 1930 Carleton Ellis, who worked on organic hydrogenation reactions 
and the chemistry of petroleum derivatives, was able to publish a book that in-
cluded a literature survey of the recent developments in hydrogenation reactions 
and catalysts.20 
 
3.1.7.  Raney Nickel Catalysts  
 
Progress in the use of precious metal catalysts for small-scale hydrogenation 
reactions, together with the increasing use of catalysts in new industrial process-
es, stimulated a much more practical interest in the development and commer-
cial use of all types of catalysts. Improvements were based on using the most 
appropriate physical form of a catalyst for large-scale operation. Not surprising-
ly, it can be concluded that poor catalyst quality might explain why some of the 
early catalysts gave poor results. After the late 1920’s, better quality control was 
introduced and a wide range of physical tests gradually became available.  
Although most of the early experimental work on general catalysts was car-
ried out by universities followed by industrial organizations, it was still possible 
for individuals to make signiﬁcant contributions to process development. The 
invention of Raney nickel catalysts is a good example.21  
Murray Raney was not a chemist, but he became interested in catalytic hy-
drogenation after he had designed a cottonseed oil hydrogenation unit for the 
Lookout Oil and Reﬁning Co.  For this process supported nickel catalysts,  made

on site, were used but they had irreproducible activities. This was probably due 
to the difﬁculties in synthesising a catalyst precursor that was consistently uni-
form in both chemical and physical properties, and then reducing this material to 
the metal in a consistent way so that the resulting active crystallites behaved 
similarly during catalysis. These problems led Raney to consider how he could 
make a better catalyst. He knew from his experience that when hydrogen was 
generated from a ferrosilicon alloy by treatment with caustic soda, sodium sili-
cate and a ﬁne iron oxide powder residue were formed. This suggested that if he 
made a nickel/silicon alloy and dissolved the silicon in caustic soda, he could 
make an active nickel oxide catalyst. A simple experiment using an alloy con-
taining 50% nickel showed that nickel metal, not nickel oxide, was actually pro-
duced and that it was signiﬁcantly more active than the supported nickel oxide 
catalyst that was being used to hydrogenate the cottonseed oil.22 He delayed test-
ing a nickel/aluminum alloy because aluminum was expensive, but did get 
around to patenting the procedure two years later.23 The catalyst recipe is given 
in Table 3.7. Raney nickel is normally stored under a suitable liquid to prevent 
loss of activity.  
Raney believed that his catalyst was active at low temperatures because it 
contained hydrogen. It is probable that the hydrogen evolved when the activated 
catalyst is heated arises from the reaction of residual water in the catalyst with 
aluminum.24 The catalyst was soon being used to hydrogenate vegetable oil but 
at the time was not considered for other uses. Raney subsequently registered his 
name as a trademark for the catalyst and alloy powders.  
In 1931 Homer Adkins came to the conclusion that Raney nickel was better 
than any other nickel catalyst then available for organic hydrogenation reactions, 
as well as being more convenient to use. He described the new catalyst in a 1932 
paper,25 and it was soon being widely used in other laboratories. Adkins was one 
of the ﬁrst to study the catalyst extensively for a wider range of hydrogenation 
reactions.  
Full details of the use of Raney nickel are given in Adkins’ book and in the 
review by Lieber and Morritz.26 It is interesting to recall that Adkins found the 
various Raney nickel catalysts described in the literature so different that he 
80 
Chapter 3 
categorized them with a series of W numbers. The samples he prepared at dif-
ferent temperatures had variable aluminum and alumina content and variable 
stability when stored. An important feature was that the ﬁnished catalyst con-
tained hydrogen and could be made by a consistent procedure to give the prop-
erties required by a particular operator. A dry form of Raney nickel is now used 
extensively to hydrogenate benzene by the industrial cyclohexane process li-
censed by IFP.27  
Various Raney nickel, cobalt, and copper catalysts are still provided com-
mercially by Grace Davison, who now owns the copyright, for use in both slurry 
reactors and ﬁxed beds. These are often promoted with other metals, such as 
chromium and barium, and can be supplied in the form of powders, granules, or 
extrudates with a variety of pore sizes.28  
Despite its usefulness in laboratory and small-scale hydrogenation proce-
dures, Raney nickel was not immediately used for industrial hydrogenation pro-
cesses. This was partly because of its relatively high manufacturing costs. In 
fact, from the late 1930s when reproducible nickel/silica catalysts became com-
mercially available, it was no longer being used for vegetable oil hydrogenation. 
Since that time its use has been limited to the hydrogenation of ethylene oxide to 
glycol, dextrose to sorbitol and benzene to cyclohexane.  
 
3.1.8.  Nickel Oxide/Kieselguhr Catalysts  
 
As the demand for organic chemicals began to exceed the supply from natural 
sources there was an increased industrial interest in the development of hydro-
genation processes to saturate aromatic compounds and oleﬁnic bonds.  
 
Nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalysts had been used since just after Sabatier de-
scribed his experiments. It has been noted that following his collaboration with 
Normann, Joseph Crosﬁeld in the United Kingdom used supported nickel oxide 
industrially in 1910 to make soap. Supported nickel oxide catalysts were subse-
quently used in the United States as well.29,56 Of course, these catalysts had to be 
reduced in hydrogen to form nickel metal before use. Supports such as kiesel-
guhr or pumice were also known to improve catalyst stability and give longer 
life during use in large-scale processes such as natural oil hydrogenation. There 
were always problems in reducing the nickel oxide properly and most operators 
seem to have experienced difficulty in achieving reproducible results at a time 
when many small companies made their own catalysts in small quantities with 
little quality control.  
Adkins investigated the preparation of nickel and copper hydrogenation cat-
alysts in 1931 and attempted to optimize a nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalyst prep-
aration. A typical method of production was to add sodium carbonate solution to 
a slurry of kieselguhr with a nickel salt solution and precipitate basic nickel car-
bonate. The mixed solid was then ﬁltered, washed, dried, calcined at 4000C, and 
pelletted with a lubricant such as graphite.  
 
 
Hydrogenation Catalysts 
81 
Reproducible catalyst performance could not be achieved unless the catalyst 
was carefully reduced at temperatures up to at least 4000C. It was ﬁnally con-
cluded that the raw catalyst contained a complex mixture of nickel hydroxysili-
cates and kieselguhr.30 With alkaline precipitation conditions it is possible to 
form a layer of silica gel on the kieselguhr surface that reacts with the nickel 
hydroxide/carbonate slurry as it is precipitated. This results in a layer of nickel 
antigorite (Ni3Si2O5(OH)4) on the support.31 The same mineral has also been 
found following the reaction of nickel hydroxide with Pyrex glass under hydro-
thermal conditions.32  
As the nickel antigorite forms, electron micrographs show that the kiesel-
guhr/silica gel/nickel hydroxide structure changes. Silica plates develop as lay-
ers of hydroxyl groups from the nickel hydroxide brucite structure react with 
silica tetrahedra. Coenen suggests that the antigorite layer acts as a reactive sur-
face that combines with a further layer of nickel hydroxide.31  
The chemical combination of nickel oxide and support explains the need for 
high-temperature reduction of nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalysts before use and 
the high metal content required (see Table 3.10). A practical solution to the 
problem was to prereduce the catalyst at a high temperature and to stabilize the 
reduced nickel with air before use in industrial reactors. By the 1930s prereduc-
tion and stabilization were becoming standard procedures for catalysts used in 
fat-hardening and iso-octane operations.  
The work by Coenen and others conﬁrmed that the reduction of nickel hy-
drosilicates is inhibited by water in the lattice. This had led to the early problems 
in reducing the catalyst industrially because water forms continuously during 
reduction, not only as the nickel compounds are converted to metal but also as 
the remaining hydroxyl layers gradually decompose. Catalysts become active 
only after reduction at temperatures in the range 300–4000C, and even then a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the nickel oxide is unreduced and the lattice still con-
tains water.  
Thermogravimetric analysis in air or inert atmospheres demonstrates that a 
typical catalyst gradually dries before the hydrates and residual carbonates de-
compose between 80–9000C. A typical catalyst reduces slowly between 240–
5000C with a peak in water evolution at 3500C. However, small-scale water evo-
lution is also noted between 200
 and 2500C. The catalyst is only around 85% 
reduced at 5000C. These results are shown in Table 3.8.  
Commercially, the prereduction of small batches of catalyst overcame the 
need for a high-temperature reduction in a reactor: 
• Raw pellets were slowly heated to about 3800C for 72 h to decompose 
hydrates and residual carbonate from the structure.  
• Calcined catalyst was cooled and then reduced in a stream of nitrogen 
containing 3–5% hydrogen as the bed temperature was slowly increased 
to 3900C. The temperature of hot-spots could be controlled by variations 
in the volume of hydrogen added.

• Following reduction, the catalyst was again cooled in nitrogen and the re-
duced nickel was then slowly oxidized by adding oxygen to the circulat-
ing gas. The maximum catalyst temperature was kept below 2500C as the 
oxidation zone as monitored by the temperature proﬁle moved through 
the catalyst bed. Reduced catalyst could also be stabilized by cooling in 
carbon dioxide to 250C before adding air to the carbon dioxide until the 
bed temperature was stable.  
Prereduced catalyst could be handled safely as it was being transferred to 
the hydrogenation reactor and then easily reduced at temperatures in the range 
180– 2500C before use. Table 3.8 compares reduction of a prereduced catalyst 
and a typical catalyst.  
Careful decomposition and reduction of nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalyst 
produces small active nickel crystallites. Under normal conditions, when the 
catalyst is not completely reduced, the nickel crystallites are supported by unre-
duced antigorite. It is important not to overreduce the remaining nickel com-
pounds because high temperatures sinter the crystallites already formed. This is 
illustrated in Table 3.9. Active metal surface area increases as the degree of re-
duction increases up to a temperature of about 4000C. Above this temperature, 
metal surface area begins to fall as the increased degree of reduction is in-
sufﬁcient to balance the loss of metal area caused by sintering which leads to the 
growth in the size of the metal crystallites.  
Catalyst formulation was later changed by the addition of small amounts of 
copper. This resulted in a product which could be reduced, at least partially, 
below 2000C. The catalyst could therefore be reduced in the reactor, thus avoid-
ing the cost of pre-reduction and the need for replacing equipment required for 
pre-reduction.

Thermogravimetric analysis of the copper/nickel catalyst clearly indicates a 
signiﬁcant difference from the original nickel catalyst: 
• The copper/nickel catalyst contains more residual hydrate, hydroxyl and 
carbonate than the nickel catalyst.  
• Undecomposed copper/nickel catalyst reduces very easily in hydrogen 
with two distinct reduction peaks. The ﬁrst, between 180–2800C, corre-
sponds to the reduction of free nickel and copper oxides. The second, be-
tween 240–4500C, corresponds to the single reduction peak of nickel cat-
alyst.  
The low-temperature peak explains the easy reduction of catalyst below 
2000C. Reduction details are shown in the last column of Table 3.8.  
Thus, the replacement of some nickel with copper in the nickel/antigorite 
structure allows easier reduction of up to half of the nickel in the catalyst at a 
reasonably low temperature. The remaining nickel/antigorite still provides a 
support for the nickel and copper crystallites and has a structure similar to the 
original nickel catalyst. Table 3.9 shows that the nickel surface area, although 
higher in a copper/nickel catalyst up to about 3000C, is the same for both cata-
lysts at 4000C. The addition of more than 5% copper can lead to rapid sintering 
during operation and thus, a shorter catalyst lifetime. The feedstock for most 
catalytic applications contains traces of sulfur compounds. This is absorbed by 
the catalyst up to levels of 16% and this also results in catalyst deactivation.  
Table 3.10 gives the composition of typical nickel oxide/kieselguhr and 
copper-promoted nickel oxide/kieselguhr catalysts.

industrial success. Most early nickel oxide/alumina catalysts were made by im-
pregnation. This was not always satisfactory; however, particularly if operation 
was to be at a high temperature, since the nickel metal could react with the sup-
port.  
Zelinsky, the Russian chemist, worked with nickel oxide/alumina catalysts 
for a number of hydrogenation reactions and was probably one of the ﬁrst to 
describe co-precipitation of nickel oxide and alumina in 1924.33 Since then many 
other nickel catalysts with alumina supports have been co-precipitated and used 
successfully in the production of synthesis gas, hydrogen, and town gas.  
In the 1940’s Feitknecht and others recognized that a particular form of 
blue-green basic nickel/aluminum carbonate could be prepared from mixed 
nickel and aluminum solutions under speciﬁc conditions.34 The solid, as with the 
nickel oxide/ kieselguhr catalyst had the magnesia brucite structure, with part of 
the nickel layer replaced by aluminum and some of the hydroxyl groups re-
placed by carbonate.35  
Altman showed that the formula of the nickel Feitknecht compound is 
Ni6Al2(OH)16(CO3)4H2O. Nickel and aluminum can be replaced by certain other 
di-and trivalent metal ions. Since 1942, similar mixed metal precipitates were 
discovered during the development of copper oxide/zinc oxide/alumina catalysts 
and it is now recognised that they are similar in structure to natural green rusts.36 
It is important that during precipitation the nickel/aluminum atomic ratio in a 
Feitknecht compound be within the range 2:1–3:1, and carefully controlled con-
ditions must be maintained in order to produce the most stable catalysts. For 
example, when alkali is added slowly to an acidic solution of nickel and alumi-
num nitrates to precipitate the basic carbonate, there is a gradual change in pH. 
The ﬁrst solid to precipitate at low pH is alumina-rich, whereas the ﬁnal precipi-
tate, when the pH has increased, is nickel-rich. Precipitates with more uniform 
particle size and metal distribution form if the solutions are added as quickly as 
practicable with good mixing.37 The precipitate should also be allowed to age at 
a reasonably high temperature for it to become more homogeneous.  
After ﬁltering and drying the Feitknecht compound is carefully decomposed 
at the lowest possible temperature to form a metastable mixture of nickel oxide 
and alumina (Ni6Al2O9) that should not contain any free oxides. Thermogravi-
 
 
Hydrogenation Catalysts

metric analysis shows that water of crystallization is lost between 150
 and 2100C 
and that the hydroxyl and carbonate structure breaks down from 290
 to 4500C.38  
Subsequent reduction of the mixed oxide produces active nickel crystallites 
that have defects containing small particles of nickel aluminate. The nickel ox-
ide content of the catalysts used for prereforming of synthesis gas or the catalyt-
ic rich-gas process (Chapter 9) will, therefore, be as high as 78–80%. Despite 
this, catalysts are very stable at temperatures up to 6000C and operate for long 
periods.  
Other catalysts used for hydrocarbon steam reforming or methanation that 
have lower nickel content are prepared with the Feitknecht compound precipi-
tated in the large pores of an inert support before it is decomposed.39  
Catalysts prepared from Feitknecht compounds are analogous to the solid 
solutions of magnetite and alumina (Chapter 10), which, when reduced, give 
stable and active ammonia synthesis catalysts.  
 
3.1.10.  Copper Chromite Catalysts  
 
The high pressure methanol process introduced by BASF in 1923 was based on 
the use of zinc/oxide/chromium oxide catalysts. The success of this process 
stimulated further work by others to make different catalysts for both methanol 
and higher alcohols. It was recognised quite early on that copper formulations 
were potentially very good catalysts, but that they were very prone to poisoning. 
It is interesting to note that most of the investigations were carried out by indus-
trial organisations rather than universities, probably because of the need for high 
pressure technology that was not easily available to universities at the time. This 
led to most of the information being published, if disclosed at all, in patents ra-
ther than in scientiﬁc journals, with much of the early information being forgot-
ten. The ﬁnal BASF catalyst was a mixture of zinc oxide and chromic acid that 
was reduced before use.40 Natta, working for Montecatini, produced a better 
precipitated zinc chromite catalyst with a relatively low chromium content.41 
While DuPont produced a precipitated zinc chromite catalyst containing a higher 
proportion of chromium, their patent (issued to Lazier)42 
described other chro-
mites, including a copper chromite that was intended for use in higher alcohol 
production.51 This early work led to the development of copper chromite cata-
lyst.  
When Adkins tried to modify the Lazier recipe and make a copper chromite 
hydrogenation catalyst, he found that an active black cupric oxide was produced 
instead of the red oxide claimed by Lazier.43 Adkins and Folkers subsequently 
suggested modiﬁcations to the recipe, including the addition of barium, magne-
sium, or calcium oxides to stabilize the black oxide form, which was more ac-
tive. A typical recipe and catalyst composition is shown in Table 3.11.  
The investigations of Adkins and his colleagues conﬁrmed that copper 
chromium  catalysts  were  active for the  hydrogenation of functional  groups in

Comment  
 
Early catalysts contained about 1% MgO.  
Modern catalysts contain barium and/or manganese oxides. Manganese in-
creases activity but reduces selectivity; barium increases selectivity and sta-
bilizes catalyst by concentrating on the surface to prevent sintering and scav-
enge poisons.  
During calcination stages a proportion of the black trivalent chromium is oxi-
dized to hexavalent chromium. This reaches a maximum at about 250–
3000C. At the ﬁnal calcination temperature of up to 4500C most of the unde-
sirable hexavalent chromium has been rereduced to trivalent form. Only 
about 2–3 wt% remains. Care should be taken when reducing catalyst with 
high hexavalent chromium content because of the exothermic heat release.  
The catalyst is cheap and easy to produce,43 
and resists typical poisons more 
easily than nickel catalysts.

esters, amides, aldehydes, and ketones under moderate conditions. It was shown 
that nickel catalysts were still preferred for the hydrogenation of oleﬁnic bonds, 
aromatic rings, furane, pyridine, oximes, and cyanides, and nitro-compounds.  
Adkins’ copper chromite catalyst is still widely used today. Nickel chromite 
catalysts made according to a similar recipe were also used until recently as 
methanation catalysts. It is probable that as a result of environmental re-
strictions, future use of catalysts containing chromium will be limited.  
 
3.1.11.  Copper Oxide/Zinc Oxide Catalysts  
 
Following the introduction of a copper chromite catalyst based on the DuPont 
recipe for zinc chromite, a further copper catalyst was developed from experi-
mental work related to the high-pressure methanol synthesis process.44  
Precipitated copper oxide/zinc oxide catalysts were more active for a range 
of reactions than zinc chromite but lost activity as the copper was poisoned by 
gaseous impurities in the synthesis gas. The two oxides were found to be mutu-
ally promoting in methanol synthesis because the mixture of very small crystal-
lites was more active than the individual oxides.

Several catalyst formulations were originally described and conﬁrmed high 
activity with an optimum copper oxide content in the range 30–40%. A compo-
sition corresponding to the formula CuO·2ZnO (Table 3.12) was selected for 
industrial use in dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and gas puriﬁcation applica-
tions. Operating stability depended on careful washing of the precipitate, but by 
efﬁcient control of production conditions, it was possible to obtain catalysts con-
taining less than 1000 ppm of metal oxide impurities.  
Catalyst activity depends on the surface area of metallic copper and the cat-
alyst must be carefully reduced at a gas inlet temperature in the range 180–
2000C. The maximum temperature should be less than 2300C to maximize the 
copper surface area. It was originally suggested that zinc oxide slowly reduced 
to form a solid solution of zinc and copper often described as α-brass. Some 
early experimental results are shown in Table 3.13.  
Brass formation is not a practical problem because typical operating tem-
peratures are less than the suggested onset of zinc oxide reduction. Differential 
thermogravimetric analysis simply shows that even with 100% hydrogen no zinc 
oxide reduction can be detected at temperatures up to 6000C. Copper oxide re-
duces sharply at approximately 200–2500C. The deactivation attributed to zinc 
oxide reduction may have been due to poor temperature control and hot spots in 
the catalyst bed.  
Because of the facile low-temperature reduction/reoxidation cycle, copper 
oxide/zinc oxide catalyst has often been used in gas puriﬁcation as well as hy-
drogenation–dehydrogenation reactions (Table 3.14).

Oxygen or hydrogen can be removed from inert gas streams by the addition 
of stoichiometric volumes of hydrogen or oxygen, respectively. Not surprising-
ly, the catalyst can also be used to remove traces of sulfur from gas streams. 
More than 10 wt% of sulfur can be absorbed by the catalyst at about 3000C.  
The main use of copper oxide/zinc oxide catalysts has been in dehydrogena-
tion and hydrogenation reactions. These include the dehydrogenation of isopro-
pyl alcohol to acetone as well as the hydrogenation of oxo-alcohols and fatty 
acid methyl esters. Although in many processes copper chromite catalysts are 
preferred to copper oxide/zinc oxide, the environmental problems involved in 
disposing of chromium wastes may reverse the situation.  
Copper oxide/zinc oxide was the ﬁrst catalyst to be tested in the low-
pressure methanol synthesis process.45 The relatively large copper and zinc ox-
ide particles, the poor metal distribution, and the absence of a structural stabi-
lizer led to rapid deactivation by poisons and thermal sintering. The problem 
was solved thanks to two signiﬁcant changes. Firstly, improved versions of ter-
nary catalysts based on copper/ zinc/alumina originally tested in the 1920s were 
developed.46 These were followed by even better catalysts made by new precipi-
tation techniques that produced Feitknechttype intermediates (see Chapter 10). 
Secondly, the purity of the synthesis gas increased dramatically, thanks to a 
change of feedstock from coal to naphtha followed later by natural gas, and the 
key problem of sulfur poisoning was largely solved.

These problems typify the difficulties in developing the early catalytic pro-
cesses. Nevertheless, full-scale production was eventually very successful in 
many countries and led to the widespread use of edible butter substitutes as well 
as soap and candles. Hydrogenation removed the unpleasant smell of fats and 
allowed the use of ﬁsh and whale oils, which, until then, had only been useful in 
supplying glycerine. Crosﬁeld was producing 100–150 tonnes of margarine a 
week from whale oil in1908 and 1000 tonnes a week by 1918 in plants in Brom-
borough and Port Selby. By the time Sabatier had published his book in 1922,4 
some 16 plants were operating in the United States making 92 brands of shorten-
ing! The ﬁrst products to be made were lard substitutes, but soon vegetable 
shortenings became available, and products such as Crisco, Selex, and Fairco, 
melting at 33–370C became household names. It was not necessary to hydrogen-
ate the oil completely and by mixing fully hydrogenated oil with untreated oil, 
the necessary consistency could be obtained using less hydrogen.  
Experience led to the introduction of catalysts based on nickel nitrate and 
oxalate, followed by lactate or formate50 as well as the original carbonates, all 
supported on infusorial earth, pumice, or even charcoal to increase activity. Re-
duction procedures were found to be important in obtaining the highest catalyst 
activity. Reoxidation of nickel before use had to be avoided. Mixed nickel oxide 
and copper oxide reduced more easily than nickel oxide alone.51 
As Raney found in the 1920s, catalyst reproducibility was a real problem 
during a period when just about every small operator made his own catalyst. The 
ready availibility of Raney nickel supplied in an easily activated form and then 
the more reliable and active prereduced nickel catalysts provided by Harshaw52 
were a relief for producers and led to further developments in the process. 
During the early period of development operating conditions evolved for 
the treatment of different fats and oils depending on the extent and type of un-
saturation. More practical ways of mixing the oil and hydrogen were introduced 
and selective hydrogenation became more important. 
 
3.2.2.  Oil Hydrogenation 
 
Glycerides are extensively used as butter and lard substitutes in foods, but they 
must be modified by hydrogenation before being used. This allows control of 
the melting point and removes unpleasant odors. Table 3.15 lists several im-
portant unsaturated fatty acids and the corresponding saturated derivatives. 
Table 3.16 shows the most commercially useful vegetable oils with an indi-
cation of unsaturated or saturated acid content. Natural oils, or glycerides, con-
tain a mixture of long-chain fatty acids randomly esterified with glycerol. All 
natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, usually C14–C20,but 
predominantly C16–C18. As many as three double bonds are present in some 
common fatty acids, all in the cis form and never conjugated.

3.2.3.  Fat Hardening Catalysts 
 
Nickel catalysts are almost always used to hydrogenate natural oils. While pal-
ladium is also active and selective, it has usually proved to be too expensive. 
Copper catalysts are not active enough and, apart from being difficult to filter 
from the product, lead to toxicity problems. Low activity and quality control 
difficulties mean that copper cannot compete with nickel.

Chapter 3 
For many years after the fat hydrogenation process was introduced, manu-
facturers made their own catalysts when they were needed. Then, gradually, the 
nickel salt producers began to make the catalysts for operators. This improved 
quality and ensured more efficient operation. By 1928 the best catalyst supports 
were found to be kieselguhr or fuller’s earth,53 charcoal,54 and complex silicates 
such as permutite.55 Many other practical ideas were introduced such as: 
• Protecting the prereduced catalyst with hardened fat before use. 
• Adding more catalyst to combat the effect of recognized poisons. 
• Regenerating oxidized catalyst by a second reduction. 
It was concluded that the active catalyst was a nickel suboxide,56 probably 
because of the difficulty in reducing nickel hydrosilicates in the catalyst. 
The catalyst business gradually progressed until the 1930s during which 
time Harshaw, in the United States, became one of the principal suppliers. More 
reliable active catalysts supported on kieselguhr or silica alumina became avail-
able, backed by quality control and technical service.52 Prereduced catalysts pro-
tected from reoxidation with solid fats were used almost exclusively. Catalysts 
were supported on a suitable inert material with large pores to provide a large 
accessible surface area for the reaction. The most important support material 
became kieselguhr, although some alumina and proprietary supports were also 
used. A typical catalyst composition is shown in Table 3.17. 
Several different production methods are now standard: 
• Dry reduction: Basic nickel carbonate is precipitated by adding sodium 
carbonate to a mixture of a nickel salt and a support at about 1000C. Dur-
ing the precipitation nickel silicates are also believed to form, as well as 
basic carbonates, and thus makes it difficult to reduce all of the nickel to 
the metal but does provide a good support. The product is filtered, 
washed, and dried and then carefully reduced with a hydrogen–nitrogen 
mixture in a rotary calciner at 290–4500C. The pyrophoric catalyst can 
then be mixed with a hardened oil that, when solidified, will prevent re-
oxidation before use.

• Wet reduction: Insoluble nickel formate is precipitated by adding sodium 
formate to a strong solution of a nickel salt. Alternatively, formic acid can 
be added to precipitated nickel hydroxide or carbonate. The precipitate is 
filtered and washed with minimum water to remove impurities and dried. 
Catalyst is suspended in dry saturated oil and slowly heated first to about 
2000C and then to about 2500C. The hydrate first decomposes at up to 
1800C and finally the formate itself decomposes to produce finely divided 
nickel at about 2000C. Nickel can be filtered from the mixture and sus-
pended in fresh oil. The suspension forms flakes as it solidifies and the 
catalyst is ready for use. 
• Electrolytic precipitation: Nickel hydroxide may also be precipitated onto 
a support from nickel anodes suspended in a stirred bath of 1% sodium 
chloride at pH 9–9.5. The catalyst is filtered, washed, dried, ground to the 
correct size, and dry-reduced before the addition of a hardened oil to pro-
tect it from oxidation. Before dispatch powdered catalyst is formed into 
flakes or shapes that can be easily added to the hydrogenator.  
• Raney nickel: For some years after it was first introduced, Raney nickel 
was successfully used as a fat-hardening catalyst and provided a repro-
ducible catalyst at a time when nickel catalyst production was unreliable. 
 
3.2.4.  Catalyst Selectivity 
 
The melting point and the resistance of natural oils to oxidation depend on the 
unsaturation of the fatty acid component. For example, unstable linolenic acid, 
with three double bonds, must be selectively hydrogenated to linoleic or oleic 
acid before the oil is stable enough to be used domestically. On the other hand, 
the stearic acid content of a natural oil should not be increased unless a high-
melting, hard product is required. Melting-point control is the most important 
factor in producing a selective catalyst.57 
The hydrogenation process has, therefore, become popularly known as fat 
hardening. It converts oils to solids, with convenient softening points, that resist 
oxidation and contain polyunsaturated linoleic esters that are felt to be nutrition-
ally useful. Most fats can be synthesized in the body, except for those containing 
linoleic and linolenic acids, so these are the essential fatty acids that must be 
provided with food. 
As well as controlling the final product composition by selective, stepwise 
hydrogenation of the double bonds, it is important to control isomerization dur-
ing the process. Double bonds in natural oils are always in the cis-isomer form, 
which leads to a higher melting point than in trans-isomers. Isomerization from 
cis- to trans-isomers is therefore generally undesirable. Double bonds in unsatu-
rated fatty acids, which are always unconjugated, are separated by an active 
methylene group and, if possible, should not be isomerized to give a conjugated 
arrangement. 
94 
Chapter 3 
The ideal reaction would be the adsorption of the linolenic chain on the cat-
alyst surface and hydrogenation of one double bond before desorption of the 
triglyceride molecule. When all of the linolenic acid in the triglyceride has been 
converted to linoleic acid, any further hydrogenation of linoleic to oleic acid 
would begin. The desired extent of hydrogenation depends on the melting prop-
erties required. The product should be solid at typical ambient temperatures yet 
melt in the mouth. This obviously varies in different climates. 
It is not just the degree of hydrogenation that affects melting point, but also 
the nature of the isomers in the product. Unfortunately, the catalysts active for 
hydrogenation, also have activity for isomerization: 
• The adsorbed double bond is rearranged rather than hydrogenated. 
• The double bond migrates in either direction to form one of four possible 
positional cis- or trans-isomers. 
• The isomers formed may also be hydrogenated to reach the thermody-
namic equilibrium content of about 66% trans-isomers. Trans-
isomerization can be suppressed or maximized to some extent by select-
ing appropriate operating conditions or using a sulfided catalyst. 
Fortunately, polyunsaturated oils are preferentially adsorbed by the catalyst, 
compared with monounsaturated oils, and are therefore hydrogenated first with a 
selective catalyst. Moreover, when a conjugated diene does form, it is more re-
active and is quickly hydrogenated. 
A steady supply of hydrogen to the catalyst surface promotes hydrogenation 
rather than isomerization. Thus, when hydrogen is readily available, polyunsatu-
rated oils are hydrogenated faster than conjugated chains can desorb. However, 
too much hydrogen on the catalyst surface is undesirable as it can lead to over-
hydrogenation and lower selectivity. Selectivity is, therefore, controlled by a 
careful balance of operating pressure, stirring, hydrogen transfer, operating tem-
perature, and the catalyst loading. Transisomerization increases as the monoun-
saturated content of the oil increases at high operating temperature. 
 
3.2.5.  Feed Pretreatment 
 
The crude vegetable oils must be carefully purified before they are used. Free 
fatty acids are neutralized with alkali, while pigments and poisons, such as alkyl 
soaps, phosphatides, thioglucosides, and amino acids are bleached with fuller’s 
earth. Oils are carefully filtered and dried to remove water, which can produce 
fatty acids by hydrolysis during hydrogenation and thus damage the catalyst. 
 
3.2.6.  Catalyst Operation 
 
The catalyst is provided as solid flakes or droplets that contain prereduced nickel 
coated with a layer of solid fat that melts in the hot oil before reaction. The use 
 
 
Hydrogenation Catalysts 
95 
of shapes retards reoxidation of the nickel and any problems associated with 
dust. Suppliers recommend the quantity of catalyst and the operating conditions 
required to provide the target melting point and iodine value for products. Most 
catalysts can be used with different vegetable oils to allow rapid switching from 
one product to another. 
High selectivity towards linoleic acid is required for the production of edi-
ble oils or fats. This means that only one double bond in the triunsaturated lino-
lenic glyceride is hydrogenated to give linoleic glyceride. Complete hydrogena-
tion to the saturated stearate glyceride results in a product with a fatty taste. Fur-
thermore, good selectivity to the linoleic glyceride also controls the texture of 
the fat produced, giving a uniform composition with sharper melting characteris-
tics for products ranging from ice cream and salad dressings to soft margarines. 
Trans-isomer selectivity is important in producing fats to replace cocoa but-
ter in chocolate. A high trans-isomer content allows the chocolate to melt in the 
mouth. A high proportion of trans-isomers is obtained when sulfided nickel cat-
alysts are used. 
On the industrial scale, triglycerides are hydrogenated in large reactors and 
the reaction is often diffusion limited. Small catalyst particles are used to allevi-
ate this limitation. However, the catalyst should still be easily removed from the 
product by a simple filtering procedure. 
The pressure of hydrogen should be sufficient to enable hydrogenation of 
linolenate to linoleate and sequentially oleate to where necessary, with minimum 
isomerization of the remaining double bonds. The pressure of hydrogen should 
never be sufficiently high so that further hydrogenation to stearate occurs. Stir-
ring within the reactor usually provides adequate mixing. If necessary, selectivi-
ty can usually be improved by using a different catalyst.57 This may be either a

less active older catalyst or a smaller dose of a more active catalyst with appro-
priate changes in the operating conditions. Typical sets of operating conditions 
are shown in Table 3.18. 
 
3.2.7.  Catalyst Poisons 
 
Natural oils contain traces of sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen com-
pounds. These are usually removed to a reasonable level by suitable cleaning 
processes before the oils are hydrogenated. Where removing them completely is 
too expensive compared with the price of the catalyst, some poisoning has often 
been accepted by producers. 
Oils can be pretreated with an old catalyst, no longer active enough for fat 
hardening, in a guard reactor to protect new catalysts. Where it is more conven-
ient to use additional new catalyst to absorb the poisons, it has been estimated 
that the following proportions of the catalyst are equivalent to 1 ppm of poisons: 
• Sulfur in thioglucosides 0.004% 
• Phosphorus in lecithins 0.0008% 
• Nitrogen in amino acids 0.0016% 
In some cases rather more extra catalyst must be added, depending on how 
any poison is adsorbed. Poisons that are adsorbed on the catalyst surface rather 
than inside the pores make the catalyst less selective. If poisons are evenly dis-
tributed on the surface and in the pores then the catalyst selectivity can be re-
stored at the expense of producing more isomers. 
It is common for catalysts to be deliberately poisoned by sulfur to increase 
trans-isomerization and to provide products with sharper melting points. Up to 
2–3% sulfur relative to the nickel content is added to trans-selective catalysts. 
However, the quantity of catalyst used must be increased because sulfided cata-
lysts are less active. 
3.3.  
FATTY ACID HYDROGENATION 
Unsaturated fatty acids produced by the hydrolysis of triglycerides can be satu-
rated by hydrogenation in batch or continuous processes. The catalysts already 
described for triglyceride hydrogenation can be used. Operation is at 160–1800C 
and 25 atm pressure for vegetable fatty acids and up to 190–2000C for tallow 
and fish oil fatty acids. The use of higher hydrogen pressures not only increases 
the rate of reaction and limits the attack of the acid on the catalyst but provides 
better reaction conditions. The catalyst dose is about 0.2% nickel catalyst to oil 
treated. 
A continuous fixed bed process has been developed that uses a precious 
metal catalyst to hydrogenate vegetable oils and animal fats, as well as fatty

acids.58 The regenerable, easily recovered catalyst resists the effects of acid and 
avoids contamination of the products with nickel or copper soaps. Two beds are 
used. In the first, most of the feed is hydrogenated and in the second, hydrogena-
tion to the required product specification is completed. Disadvantages of con-
ventional nickel catalyst seem to have been overcome. 
3.4.  
THE PRODUCTION OF FATTY ALCOHOLS 
Long-chain alcohols are widely used as plasticizers or in the production of deter-
gents. They are available from a variety of synthetic routes or the direct hydro-
genation of natural fatty acids:  
• Hydroformylation of oleﬁns giving mixtures of normal and isoaldehydes 
that can be hydrogenated to alcohols.  
• The partial oxidation of C12–C14 normal parafﬁns to give secondary alco-
hols.  
• The oligomerization of ethylene using aluminum alkyls, followed by oxi-
dation and hydrolysis of the aluminum trialkoxides.  
• Hydrogenation of the methyl or fatty alcohol esters of fatty acids obtained 
by the hydrolysis of natural oils or fats.  
 
3.4.1.  Natural Fatty Alcohols  
 
Natural oils are hydrolyzed and the fatty acids separated by distillation. The ac-
ids are then hydrogenated to alcohols either as the methyl ester or as an ester 
with another fatty alcohol.  
Catalysts used for the hydrogenation step are usually copper chromite for-
mulations, although copper oxide/zinc oxide catalysts have also been used. The 
process accounts for about half of the copper chromite catalysts used commer-
cially. Both acid group and double bonds in the long carbon chain are hydrogen-
ated during the reaction, which produces a saturated alcohol. When an unsatu-
rated fatty alcohol is required, a more selective zinc chromite catalyst may be 
used.  
In commercial processes the copper chromite catalyst must be carefully pro-
moted for use with different oils. Catalysts must resist the action of the acids 
being treated because colored metal soaps contaminate the products. To avoid 
dust formation the catalyst should also be strong enough to resist disintegration 
in the liquid reactants. Typical catalysts used are shown in Table 3.19.

3.4.2.  Catalyst Operation  
 
Fatty alcohols are produced in either slurry or ﬁxed bed processes.  
• In slurry processes, the fatty acid is mixed in batches with a proportion of 
the fatty alcohol product to form fatty acid esters.  The ester is then circu-
lated through the reactor mixed with copper chromite catalyst powder and 
hydrogen. Fatty alcohol is removed from the system in a centrifuge that 
separates the catalyst. More than half of the catalyst can normally be re-
used, depending on the poisons present in the acid, and about 3–4 kg of 
catalyst are required per tonne of alcohol produced. With proper control 
of the acid concentration, the formation of hydrocarbon by-products can 
be minimized.  
• Fixed bed processes can be used for the hydrogenation of fatty acid me-
thyl esters. The methyl esters can be prepared directly from the fatty acid 
or by trans-esteriﬁcation of the triglyceride with methanol. The hydro-
genation is carried out in a bed of solid copper chromite catalyst, which 
usually loses activity after operating for 3–6 months. Copper oxide/zinc 
oxide catalysts have also been used.  
 
Operating conditions for the two processes are shown in Table 3.20. A pro-
cess for the direct hydrogenation of fats and oils to fatty alcohols and propane-
diol was developed by Henkel using a specially supported copper/chromium 
catalyst at 2000C and 250 atm pressure.  
 
3.4.3.  Reaction of Fatty Alcohols  
 
• Fatty aldehydes are formed selectively by dehydrogenation of the corre-
sponding fatty alcohol using copper chromite catalysts in slurries or ﬁxed 
beds. Operation is at 250–3500C and a pressure of 1 atm or less to give an 
equilibrium conversion to about 30% aldehyde.  
• α-Oleﬁns can be formed by the dehydration of fatty alcohols with an acid 
catalyst at 300–3500C.

SOME INDUSTRIAL HYDROGENATION PROCESSES  
3.5.1. Nitrobenzene Reduction  
 
Nitrobenzene hydrogenation is the principal process for aniline production. Only 
relatively small quantities of aniline are used as such, the main demand being in 
the production of isocyanates required for polyurethane synthesis. Hydrogena-
tion reactions can be carried out in the gas phase using tubular reactors and cata-
lyst pellets. Reactions containing both liquid and gas phases can also be used, 
using catalyst powders. The catalysts that have been used include copper chro-
mites, copper oxide or nickel oxide supported on kieselguhr, Raney copper, and 
nickel sulﬁde supported by alumina. All catalysts give good conversion with a 
high selectivity to aniline. During operation the conversion slowly declines and 
the catalyst must be regenerated after a few months. Deactivation is usually the 
result of carbon deposition from the thermal cracking of aniline.  
Operation is carried out at 270–2900C and 1–5 atm of hydrogen with a hy-
drogen/nitrobenzene ratio of about 1:9. The copper chromite and nickel ox-
ide/kieselguhr catalysts are made by the standard methods. Nickel sulﬁde cata-
lyst is prepared by the method described by Allied Chemical and Dye Corp. A 
nickel oxide/alumina catalyst is prepared either by impregnating activated alu-
mina with nickel nitrate followed by decomposition at 5000C or by co-
precipitation of the mixed oxides. It is then sulﬁded by treatment with hydrogen 
sulﬁde at 4500C and the NiS reduced to Ni2S3 with hydrogen at 2500C. Oxygen-
free gas should be used during the sulﬁding and reduction steps. The product 
contains both Ni2S3 and NiS.  
100 
Chapter 3 
Deactivated catalyst is carefully regenerated in a mixture of air and steam at 
300–4000C. Hydrocarbons are purged from the system and the catalyst 
rereduced with hydrogen in steam before it is reused.  
 
3.5.2.  Benzene Hydrogenation  
 
Large quantities of benzene are required throughout the world for a wide range 
of applications. A high proportion is hydrogenated to provide cyclohexane, an 
intermediate in the production of nylon ﬁbers and resins.  
The reaction involved is very simple and has been well known since Saba-
tier and Senderens reported on their experiments in 1901. They passed hydrogen 
saturated with benzene vapor at ambient temperature over a nickel catalyst at 
180–2000C. At this temperature an almost complete conversion of benzene to 
cyclohexane was achieved.59 They made two important observations:  
• Partially hydrogenated benzene derivatives were never found—only cy-
clohexane.  
• Cyclohexane was dehydrogenated above 2000C to give the reverse reac-
tion. At higher temperatures benzene cracked to form methane and car-
bon.  
Although Sabatier and Senderens claimed that other metals did not hydro-
genate benzene, later work by Zelinsky showed that benzene was easily hydro-
genated by platinum metals.  
During the late 1800s it was realized that cyclohexane was identical with 
Caucasian petroleum. Subsequently, natural gas liquids became an important 
source of up to 85% pure cyclohexane. Even as late as 1968 some 20% of the 
cyclohexane used in the United States was obtained in this way, although the 
cyclohexane content was increased to about 98% by the isomerization of 
methylcyclopentane during fractional distillation.  
Elsewhere benzene hydrogenation was increasingly used to provide 99.9% 
pure cyclohexane. Liquid phase hydrogenation at 40 atm pressure and tempera-
tures in the range 170–2300C is typical using supported nickel catalysts.60 These 
conditions avoid the isomerization of cyclohexane to methycyclopentane. Ben-
zene must be free from sulfur to avoid poisoning the catalyst, although, original-
ly, short and uneconomic catalyst lives were common. Reaction temperature and 
exotherm can be controlled by evaporation of the product and dilution of the 
benzene feed with recycled cyclohexane. A process with two hydrogenation 
steps is currently favoured. Liquid phase reaction gives 95% benzene conversion 
and is followed by adiabatic vapor phase reaction to produce cyclohexane con-
taining less than 100 ppm of benzene and methylcyclopentane.  
In an alternative vapor phase process, a platinum catalyst is used in a tubu-
lar reactor at 30 atm and about 4000C to give almost 100% selectivity. The cata-
lyst used in this process is substantially more expensive than nickel oxide.  
 
 
Hydrogenation Catalysts 
101 
3.5.2.1. Removal of Aromatics  
 
Environmental limits on the aromatic content of gasoline and diesel fuel have 
led to a further application of supported nickel hydrogenation catalysts. Benzene 
can be completely removed from light C6 reformate or other similar streams by 
liquid phase hydrogenation, before blending into the reﬁnery gasoline pool.  
The catalysts contain more than 50% nickel oxide, supported on kieselguhr 
with some added alumina, and are prereduced and stabilized. This allows for 
rapid reduction in existing reactors. The process operates at the relatively low 
temperature of 800C with hydrogen pressures in the range 20–40 atm. A liquid 
space velocity of about 2.5 h–1 is required and hydrogen addition depends on the 
aromatics content of the feed being treated.  
The aromatic-free product can be recycled to control temperature rise in the 
catalyst bed. Sulfur impurity in the feed gradually poisons the catalyst so that the 
inlet temperature must be gradually increased. Catalyst lives exceeding two 
years have been achieved.61 The same catalyst can be used to dearomatize diesel 
fuel or white oils but is then operated at up to 2000C and 125 atm hydrogen 
pressure with lower space velocity.  
 
3.5.3.  Hydrogenation of Phenol  
 
Although most of the cyclohexanone used to produce adipic acid and ε-
caprolactam has been made from cyclohexane it is also possible for phenol to be 
used. The original I. G. Farben process using phenol operated in two stages:  
• Phenol was converted to cyclohexanol by hydrogenation in either the gas 
or liquid phase using a supported nickel oxide catalyst. Typical operating 
conditions were 140–1600C and 15 atm with higher than 95% selectivity. 
• The cyclohexanol was then dehydrogenated at 400–4500C and atmos-
pheric pressure using a copper oxide/zinc oxide catalyst. More than 95% 
selectivity at about 90% conversion was obtained.  
A single-stage liquid phase process was subsequently developed by Allied 
Chemical62 and Vickers Zimmer63 using a selective palladium catalyst. More re-
cently a single-stage gas phase process was introduced that uses a selective cata-
lyst containing about 1% palladium supported on a calcium oxide/alumina mix-
ture.64 
Almost complete conversion and greater than 95% selectivity is achieved 
at 140–1700C and 1–2 atm. A relatively high calcium content (possibly in the 
form of calcium aluminate) is used to neutralise any acidic form of alumina, 
which would otherwise lead to catalyst deactivation via coke formation. Regen-
eration still remains a possibility, should the catalyst become deactivated.

SELECTIVE HYDROGENATION OF ACETYLENES AND DIENES  
The removal of acetylenes and dienes from steam-cracked oleﬁns is a critical 
step in puriﬁcation. Selective hydrogenation processes and catalysts have be-
come more important as worldwide oleﬁn production has increased in 1999 to 
more than 90 million tonnes of ethylene and almost 50 million tonnes of propyl-
ene. Demand for better catalysts with improved selectivity and longer operating 
cycles has grown as larger plants are built. Tighter product speciﬁcations have 
also been imposed now that more of the oleﬁns produced are being converted to 
polyoleﬁns.  
Before the 1950s commercial ethylene was recovered from various off-
gases, ethane or propane cracking and ethanol dehydration, as shown in Table 
3.21. Various puriﬁcation catalysts were used before ethylene production ex-
panded, and as the feed gases usually contained sulfur the catalysts were often 
metal sulﬁdes. In fact, sulﬁding was actually necessary to improve selectivity 
and operating stability. Several early catalyst types are described in Table 3.22. 
Most of the Group-VIII metals are active and quite selective, but catalysts suf-
fered from the need for frequent regeneration to remove polymers deposited 
during operation.  
By the 1950s, as demand for ethylene increased, the existing catalysts were 
operating in newly designed small-capacity steam crackers. In the United States, 
where crackers were generally based on low-molecular-weight feeds, this meant 
that acetylene was hydrogenated in cracked gas containing hydrogen, often be-
fore sulfur was removed and the gas was dried. It was inevitable that polymers 
formed during operation and they became well known as green oil. A successful 
catalyst was thereafter judged not only on acetylene conversion but also on the 
ability to avoid green oil production and the operating life between regeneration.  
The urgent demand for better catalysts intensiﬁed in the late 1950s as poly-
ethylene production was developed and new plants in Europe began to use naph-
tha feeds. Larger single-stream ethylene plants needed better reliability and se-
lectivity  from more active  catalysts. In the short term,  better acetylene  conver-

sion was achieved in existing plants by installing a guard reactor to remove trac-
es of acetylene from the separated ethylene-ethane (C2) stream. The new guard 
catalysts were prepared by supporting palladium on γ-alumina and a stoichio-
metric volume of hydrogen was added to react with the acetylene.72 Of course, 
this did not solve the problem of polymer forming in either of the catalyst beds 
although the guard bed catalyst could operate for relatively long periods. Brief 
properties of some early catalysts are given in Table 3.23.  
Since 1960 all new catalysts used for selective acetylene hydrogenation 
contain palladium supported on different forms of alumina and remove acety-
lene almost completely to achieve the much stricter speciﬁcation demanded. The 
higher activity of palladium catalysts meant that smaller volumes of catalyst 
could be used at temperatures as low as 50–600C.

3.6.1.  Acetylene Hydrogenation Process Design  
 
Two different process configurations are now used to remove acetylene from 
ethylene. The choice of these depends on how the cracked hydrocarbon gases 
are separated following desulfurization and drying:  
• If the demethanizer, which removes methane and hydrogen from the gas-
es, is the ﬁrst stage of gas separation, the acetylene removal reactor is 
placed before the ethylene-ethane (C2 stream) splitter. A methyacety-
lene/propadiene removal reactor is also needed before the propylene-
propane (C3 stream) splitter. Sufﬁcient hydrogen must be added to the C2 
and C3 streams before they enter the catalyst beds. Spare reactors must be 
available to allow for regular regeneration of the on-line catalyst because 
green oil polymers form during the hydrogenation reactions. Tail-end hy-
drogenation was developed from the guard beds using a palladium/γ-
alumina catalyst added to the early ethylene plants.73  
• When either a depropanizer or de-ethanizer is the ﬁrst stage of gas separa-
tion the acetylene can be hydrogenated in the mixed overhead streams, 
which contain up to almost 30% hydrogen. An advantage of this proce-
dure, which uses several beds of a more selective palladium/α-alumina 
catalyst, has been that no spare reactor is required because green oils are 
not usually formed. Apart from the different catalyst used, front-end hy-
drogenation is based on the original acetylene removal designs.74 
 
Both procedures work well. The choice between them is determined by the 
process supplied by the contracting company. However, the two types of palla-
dium/alumina catalyst used are very different and are not interchangeable.  
Operating problems with palladium catalysts have been associated with in-
creasingly high volumes of acetylene in the process gas, which is a result of in-
creased steam cracking severity to improve ethylene yields. Both front-end and 
tail-end reactors now include several adiabatic beds, with interbed cooling, to 
control reaction and remove the excessive heat evolved as acetylene is hydro-
genated.  
Signiﬁcant hydrogenation of ethylene can occur if the gas is not efﬁciently 
cooled or the catalyst is not very selective. This is referred to as ethylene loss. 
Catalyst selectivity is also important to minimize the formation of green oil pol-
ymers, which wastes ethylene and causes operating problems. Some process 
designs have included tube-cooled adiabatic catalyst reactors to cope with high 
acetylene concentrations, but they have not been very popular.

3.6.2.  Early Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalysts  
 
3.6.2.1.  Sulﬁded Cobalt Molybdate  
 
A supported cobalt/molybdate catalyst, probably based on the ones developed in 
the 1930s, was one of the ﬁrst types to be used in modern ethylene plants.68 The 
front-end reactor was located in the compressor train after heavy hydrocarbons 
were removed but before sulfur removal or gas drying. The catalyst was, there-
fore, partly sulﬁded. Careful temperature control was required to limit ethylene 
loss. About 10% steam was added to cracked gas, which limited the temperature 
rise and improved selectivity. An unusual feature of operation was that a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the acetylene was removed as a polymer. This de-
creased the potential temperature rise but meant that catalyst regeneration and 
subsequent reactivation was a routine procedure at intervals of 2–4 weeks and 
that a spare reactor was needed. To compensate for loss of activity the gas tem-
perature was continuously increased throughout the operating cycle. Acetylene 
levels were reduced to about 10–20 ppm with 1–3% ethylene loss. Up to 50% of 
any butadiene present in the gas was also hydrogenated. The catalyst was re-
placed after 1–2 years.  
The catalyst composition was 13.5 parts Co(NO3)26H2O and 10.5 parts 
MoO3 (i.e., CoO:MoO3 = 1.0:1.6) with 54.5 parts Al2O3.H2O; 24 parts Portland 
cement and 16 parts Kentucky clay.  
 
3.6.2.2.  Sulﬁded Nickel Oxide  
 
Following from early experience with a DuPont nickel oxide/silica alumina cata-
lyst containing magnesia, and which was reduced and sulﬁded before use,69 oth-
er nickel catalysts were later developed. Catalysts and Chemicals Inc. introduced 
a nickel cobalt/chromium catalyst supported on silica/alumina, which was used 
for several years in early ethylene plants.70 It operated as a single bed, generally 
with a spare reactor, to remove acetylene from wet cracked gases containing 
sulfur compounds. Operating conditions depended on gas composition.  
The addition of steam and, occasionally, sulfur compounds sometimes im-
proved selectivity. Less polymer was generally formed than with co-
balt/molybdate catalysts but regeneration at 375–4250C was still essential at 
regular intervals of up to 3 months. Following regeneration the catalyst had to be 
re-reduced at up to 375–4250C for 6–12 h. The sulfur content of the cracked gas 
treated could be as high as 25–50 grains per 100 standard ft3 (~1000 ppm), alt-
hough the operating temperature had then to be increased to compensate for the 
decreased activity of sulﬁded catalyst.  
Acetylene content of product ethylene was claimed to be less than 10 ppm 
with only 1% ethylene loss. At this conversion all butadiene in the gas was also 
hydrogenated. At lower butadiene conversion the acetylene content in ethylene 
106 
Chapter 3 
would rise to about 100 ppm. Many plants had problems in maintaining a low 
ethylene loss and found that the catalyst needed very frequent regeneration.  
 
3.6.2.3.  Fused Iron Oxide  
 
ICI and several other operators used a fused magnetite catalyst promoted with 
magnesia, silica, and potash in modern naphtha steam crackers designed by Kel-
logg in the late 1950s. Up to 3000 ppm of acetylene could be reduced to less 
than 50 ppm in the sulfur-free depropanizer overheads containing 12% hydro-
gen. Catalyst activity declined after about 6 months as a result of polymer depo-
sition. This was a low cost catalyst and was not regenerated but replaced as nec-
essary.71  
 
3.6.2.4. Palladium Catalyst Guard Beds  
 
The nickel and iron hydrogenation catalysts were not able to meet the more 
stringent ethylene speciﬁcations required by the new polyethylene processes. 
Existing steam crackers therefore began to back up the front-end reactors, which 
produced ethylene containing 20–50 ppm acetylene, with a tail-end reactor.72 
The guard bed, located in the C2 stream, contained a catalyst with less than 350 
ppm of palladium on a suitable γ-alumina support. Up to 2–3 mol of hydrogen 
per mole of acetylene was added, and at 60–1200C the outlet acetylene was re-
duced to less than 10 ppm. Any excess hydrogen was removed by increasing the 
operating temperature. The catalyst still needed regular regeneration to remove 
polymers and restore activity so that a spare reactor had to be available. The 
catalyst was often supplied ready for use in a small preloaded reactor.  
 
3.6.3.  Modern Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalysts  
 
Until 1958 no ethylene plant had used a tail-end palladium catalyst to hydro-
genate all of the acetylene formed in the steam cracker. This was an attractive 
possibility, however, and many of the large new US plants built in the 1960s 
were designed in this way. The less efﬁcient front-end nickel and iron catalysts 
were soon obsolete. Several signiﬁcant changes followed the use of tail-end cat-
alysts:  
• Two parallel reactors, one operating and the second regenerating, were 
placed before the C2 splitter to remove acetylene. No front-end catalysts 
were used in these plants.  
 
 
Hydrogenation Catalysts

• Where necessary, particularly in naphtha steam crackers, the same type of 
tail-end system was used to hydrogenate methyl acetylene and propadiene 
in the feed to the C3 splitter.  
In Europe four or ﬁve of the more modern 1950s steam crackers, based on 
naphtha feed, replaced the fused iron or nickel front-end catalysts with a new 
palladium catalyst using an α-alumina support.72 Success in meeting the strict 
new acetylene speciﬁcations, while hydrogenating 95% of the methyl acetylene 
and forming no green oil, led to the use of this catalyst in many new ethylene 
plant designs.  
 
3.6.4.  Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalyst Preparation  
 
Front-end and tail-end catalysts are both produced by relatively simple pro-
cedures in which palladium is impregnated onto the outside surface of an alumi-
na support in a thin layer. Theoretically, in order to achieve the required selec-
tivity, the support should be inert and take no part in the hydrogenation process.  
Tail-end catalysts are usually made with suitable γ-alumina particles with a 
relatively small surface area,72 with selectivity being controlled by the volume of 
hydrogen added to the oleﬁn stream being treated. More selective catalysts have 
been developed to avoid excessive formation of polymers and the use of hydro-
gen ratios greater than two. The addition of a suitable Group-IB metal inhibited 
the oligomerization reactions that led to green oil formation. Selectivity was also 
improved by the addition of carbon monoxide to the hydrogen stream that ad-
sorbed on the catalyst surface.  
Front-end catalysts were produced from a suitable α-alumina support with 
carefully controlled surface area and pore volume.75 The support could influence 
the hydrogenation reaction to give good selectivity with almost no polymer for-
mation. It was found that the adsorption of carbon monoxide onto the catalyst 
surface inhibited ethylene hydrogenation in the presence of a few ppm of acety-
lene. Carbon monoxide was always present in the process gas.  
Catalyst selectivity in front-end catalysts can also be controlled by the addi-
tion of a Group-IB metal when acetylene levels are high or carbon monoxide 
content is low.  
 
3.6.5.  Acetylene Hydrogenation Catalyst Operation  
 
3.6.5.1.  Tail-End Acetylene Hydrogenation  
 
Acetylene is hydrogenated in the separated C2 stream, which means that sufﬁ-
cient hydrogen must be added to the gas before the reactor. The theoretical 
amount for complete removal is 1-mol volume of hydrogen per mole volume of 
acetylene, giving 100% conversion to ethylene, but this has always been impos-
sible to achieve. There is usually an ethylene loss associated with complete 
108 
Chapter 3 
acetylene removal and in the 1960s at least three volumes of hydrogen were 
often required. Product ethylene contains less than 1 ppm acetylene.  
In some of the early large ethylene plants, high ethylene losses led to the 
formation of several tonnes of green oil per day. This resulted in the need for 
extremely frequent catalyst regeneration. Good control of the catalyst tempera-
ture and the volume of added hydrogen was essential to give optimum and stable 
operation.  
Much better catalysts now provide improved operation.73 Hydrogenation 
can be controlled by adding traces of carbon monoxide to the hydrogen. Ad-
sorbed carbon monoxide modiﬁes the relative adsorption of acetylene and eth-
ylene on the palladium and minimizes ethylene loss. The catalyst itself can also 
be made more selective by alloying the palladium with a further metal such as 
copper or silver.76 This also affects palladium dispersion and the relative adsorp-
tion of acetylene and ethylene on the catalyst surface to improve selectivity. To 
minimize temperature rise catalyst suppliers recommend that one or more cata-
lyst beds with intercoolers be used in each reactor, depending on the acetylene 
content of the C2 stream:73  
• One bed of catalyst is used when the acetylene content of the C2 stream is 
less than 0.8%.  
• Two beds of catalyst with intercooling are needed in each reactor if acety-
lene content is between 0.8 and 1.7%.  
• Three beds of catalyst with intercooling are used in each reactor for 
acetylene content up to 2.5%.  
The hydrogen ratio recommended is usually 1.5–2.0 in single or ﬁnal beds, 
where the acetylene content is lowest and maximum conversion is needed, but 
only 0.8–1.3 in the ﬁrst or second beds.73 Temperature rise can be roughly calcu-
lated as 650C or 350C for the conversion of 1% acetylene to ethane or ethylene, 
respectively.  
Reaction is controlled by increasing or decreasing the bed inlet temperature 
and changing the hydrogen ratio. Alternatively, if the reaction is not sufﬁciently 
selective, carbon monoxide can be added to the hydrogen. However, gas inlet 
temperature may then need to be increased if the preferential adsorption of car-
bon monoxide affects catalyst activity. The objective is to have about half of the 
total temperature rise in the top third of each catalyst bed. The bed inlet tem-
perature should be increased as required to maintain conversion. Catalyst should 
be regenerated when the inlet temperature reaches 1500C to avoid overhydro-
genation. Bed intercoolers or cold recycle gas are used to control catalyst tem-
perature.  
With very high acetylene levels in the C2 stream, the use of tubular reactors 
can provide good temperature control. An identical spare reactor should be 
available to allow continuous plant operation when the catalyst has to be regene-

3.6.5.2.  Tail-End Methyl Acetylene/Propadiene Hydrogenation  
 
Hydrogenation of methylacetylene and propadiene, its isomer (MAPD) in the 
separated C3 stream is very similar to tail-end acetylene removal. The possible 
reactions are: 
 
 
 
 
HC≡C·CH3  +  H2   →   CH3·CH═CH2

(3.6) 
 
Two tail-end reactors are installed, with one operating until regeneration is nec-
essary and the second ready for use. The maximum volume of hydrogen added 
should not usually exceed 2 mol per mole of MAPD. Even less may be used 
with a very selective catalyst, and there is often a signiﬁcant propylene gain.  
Green oil is not formed in large volumes, probably because C3 molecules do 
not readily adsorb on the sites that allow oligomerization of ethylene in C2 hy-
drogenation. However, occasional regeneration is required to clean the catalyst 
when the inlet temperature has been increased to 1500C.  
Each of the two reactors may have one or more catalyst beds, depending on 
the total MAPD in the feed gas. With regulated hydrogen addition, the tempera-
ture rise in each bed can be limited to less than about 400C. Temperature is con-

The catalyst is normally divided into several beds, with interbed cooling, to 
limit the temperature rise in each bed to less than 15–250C and to control the 
selectivity of the reaction. Temperature increases by 400C and 750C for every 
1.0% of acetylene converted to ethylene or ethane, respectively, and the increase 
for converting 1.0% MAPD to propylene is 400C. The number of catalyst beds 
needed in a reactor can easily be estimated. Reaction is readily controlled by 
variation of the bed inlet temperature.  
The ﬁrst charges of front-end palladium catalyst were used in 1960 in three 
small ethylene plants with a combined capacity of 150,000 tonnes year-1. These 
plants operated for six years with no regeneration, until they were eventually 
replaced by a larger, modern plant. The volume of palladium catalyst used in a 
single reactor with two beds was less than 15% of the iron catalyst it replaced, 
which had also needed a spare reactor. In other ethylene plants two reactors us-
ing a nickel catalyst were replaced by a single two-bed reactor with only 20% of 
the original volume using a palladium catalyst.75  
For economic reasons the palladium catalyst has occasionally been used to 
hydrogenate all of the acetylene in a single bed. Performance was satisfactory 
although, with large-diameter reactors and shallow catalyst beds, there was oc-
casionally a small ethylene loss. Table 3.25 gives an example of front-end cata-
lyst operation.  
Development of the front-end catalyst revealed the most important factor in 
achieving selectivity: carbon monoxide is adsorbed by the catalyst surface so 
that acetylene, methyl acetylene, and, less strongly, propadiene are adsorbed in 
preference to ethylene. Consequently, only small amounts of ethylene are hy-
drogenated at the bottom of the ﬁnal bed when most of the acetylenes have been 
removed.  
The need for carbon monoxide inhibition can be seen as the catalyst is com-
missioned. A hot spot may develop when cold gas enters the reactor and the 
overall temperature is much lower than normal operating levels. However, the 
catalyst surface in the vicinity  of the hotspot is rapidly deactivated with  carbon

Note: With increased acetylene content the number of beds increases. If the carbon monoxide con-
tent changes the inlet temperature must be adjusted. Catalyst volume required about 6 m3 for 100,000

monoxide. Fortunately carbon monoxide is always present in cracked gas, being 
formed on a reverse water gas shift reaction between carbon dioxide and steam 
on the nickel alloy tubes. This has led to the success of front-end palladium cata-
lysts. Concentrations of carbon monoxide are usually in the range 500–5000 
ppm, depending on the hydrocarbon feed and cracking conditions. Some opera-
tors have even used the catalyst with more than 1% carbon monoxide with no 
effect on acetylene removal efficiency. It is only necessary to increase the gas 
inlet temperature at higher carbon monoxide levels.  
Although no liquid polymers are formed on front-end catalysts, some acety-
lene is dimerized to produce 200–400 ppm of butadiene that is not hydrogenat-
ed. Also, some organic material, usually forms on the catalyst surface and up to 
1 wt% can be extracted from used catalyst samples. The only evidence of this 
during operation is the need to increase the operating temperature by a few de-
grees and the deposit most probably enhances the catalyst selectivity.  
A further reﬁnement in front-end catalyst formulation has been the addition 
of a second metal oxide.76 The newest catalysts often contain less palladium than 
the original types, which achieved selectivity from the use of a special low-
surface-area alumina. The new catalysts may possibly require regeneration after 
about two years.  
 
3.6.6.  Selective Hydrogenation of Pyrolysis Gasoline  
 
There are other products, apart from ethylene, that form during the steam crack-
ing of heavy feeds such as naphtha. About 20–30% of the naphtha cracked is 
recovered as a high-octane pyrolysis gasoline that contains more than 50% of 
mixed aromatics. This is signiﬁcant because the extracted aromatics now pro-
vide more benzene than is available from naphtha platforming units. In modern 
large steam crackers it can also be economic to recover the styrene that is pre-
sent.  A  typical  pyrolysis  gasoline composition is shown in  Table  3.26.  At

least 50% of the worldwide ethylene steam crackers use more than 3 million 
tonnes per year of naphtha, so that up to 1 million tonnes per year of pyrolysis 
gasoline can be produced. Recovery as an aromatic gasoline fraction or an aro-
matic stream rich in benzene provides a signiﬁcant contribution to steam crack-
ing operating economics.  
Steam cracking, of course, is designed to produce unsaturated hydrocarbons 
so pyrolysis gasoline contains dienes which must be removed by selective hy-
drogenation.  
There are two ways in which raw pyrolysis gasoline can be treated to pro-
vide a useful product:77  
• Low-temperature selective hydrogenation converts dienes to oleﬁns, and 
alkyl benzenes such as styrene to ethyl benzene, in the liquid phase. Other 
unstable hydrocarbons, such as dicyclopentadiene, that form gums are al-
so hydrogenated. At the same time α-oleﬁns isomerize to higher-octane 
internal oleﬁns.  
• When aromatics are to be extracted a second, high-temperature hydro-
genation step is needed. This operates in the vapor phase and converts 
most of the oleﬁns to parafﬁns and removes the sulfur compounds. Aro-
matics remain unchanged.  
 
3.6.6.1.  Catalyst Types  
 
A range of catalysts can be used for the selective hydrogenation step depending 
on the composition of the cracked gasoline:  
• Palladium supported on γ-alumina and promoted with chromium oxide is 
active and selective provided that methyl mercaptan, disulﬁdes, and thio-
phene do not exceed typical levels. Carbon monoxide in the hydrogen gas 
used may make the catalyst more selective.73 The catalyst gradually deac-
tivates owing to gum deposition and the effect of sulfur compounds but 
can be regenerated by burning the deposits in a stream of air at moderate 
temperatures. Several regenerations are possible before the catalyst must 
be replaced, usually after more than four years of use. Palladium is gener-
ally used when the pyrolysis gasoline contains low levels of gum.  
• Nickel oxide supported on γ-alumina is also active and selective with typ-
ical pyrolysis gasolines.77 It can be reactivated very easily at intervals of 
two to nine months by heating in hydrogen or regenerated by convention-
al burning of deposits in air when necessary. Replacement is required af-
ter about two years. 
• Nickel oxide/tungsten oxides supported on alumina are more active as 
sulﬁdes and can be used if pyrolysis gasoline contains relatively high lev-
els of reactive sulfur compounds.77

3.6.6.2.  Catalyst Operation  
 
The catalyst is loaded into ﬁxed beds and is reduced in hydrogen at 4000C be-
fore use. Good mixing of the liquid pyrolysis gasoline with gas as it ﬂows 
through the catalyst is essential and temperature is controlled by a cool recycle 
of treated gasoline. The ﬂow rate is adjusted to obtain the necessary conversion 
at minimum operating temperature. The catalyst gradually becomes deactivated 
due to the deposition of gums, but conversion is maintained by increasing the 
operating temperature. Nickel catalysts are reactivated every few months by 
treatment with hydrogen alone at 4000C. It is usual to regenerate the catalyst by 
burning off gum in air after two to three reactivations. Palladium catalysts must 
always be regenerated in air at 4000C.  
It is interesting to note that the nickel catalysts in particular are not rapidly 
deactivated by the small amounts of the mercaptans and disulﬁdes that remain in 
pyrolysis gasoline. In fact thiophenes have the beneﬁcial effect of retarding the 
hydrogenation of oleﬁns while the dienes are selectively hydrogenated. Aromat-
ics are not hydrogenated during the process, while parafﬁnic α-oleﬁns are isom-
erized. Providing that the hydrogen does not contain more than about 2000 ppm 
of carbon monoxide, catalyst selectivity may also be enhanced. A range of oper-
ating conditions is shown in Table 3.27.

OXIDATION CATALYSTS  
 
 
 
 
Oxidation catalysts were among the ﬁrst to be described and then developed 
industrially. Because of the energy evolved, oxidation processes were originally 
known as catalytically induced combustion. Some of the earliest catalytic oxida-
tion reactions used commercially are shown in Table 4.1. This list could also 
include the Deacon and the Claus processes, which were described in Chapter 2. 
Subsequently, nitric acid and formaldehyde were produced on a large scale by 
catalytic oxidation processes. In most early processes, once a reasonable catalyst 
had been developed, production was limited only by demand and the availability 
of efﬁcient equipment.  
Complete combustion of organic materials to form carbon dioxide was, of 
course, well known! By 1920 the partial combustion of organic chemicals was 
being investigated and selective catalysts were gradually developed to control 
the reactions taking place. Two important processes to produce maleic anhy-
dride and phthalic anhydride from the benzene and naphthalene in coal tar were 
among the ﬁrst to be developed commercially.  
Phthalic anhydride, produced in Germany as early as 1916 and in other 
parts of the world in the 1920s, was used initially in the synthesis of indigo dyes. 
At ﬁrst naphthalene was oxidized by chromic acid or oleum but, by a convenient 
accident, it was found that mercury catalyzed the oxidation reaction. Later work 
by BASF in Germany and H. D. Gibbs and C. Condover in the United States 
developed catalysts for the vapor phase oxidation reaction.  
Oxidation of benzene to provide maleic anhydride was developed at the 
same time, but because maleic anhydride was available as a by-product from 
phthalic  anhydride production, the  reaction did  not become  important  comer-

4.1.  
NITRIC ACID  
In 1839 Kuhlmann described ammonia oxidation to produce nitrogen oxides for 
nitric acid production using a platinum sponge catalyst at 3000C.1 At the same 
time he was also granted a patent for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and used the 
process in his factory at Loos.2 
 
He was apparently unaware of the Phillips patent 
granted in the United Kingdom, but he attempted to make sulfuric acid with a 
platinum catalyst.  
A second ammonia oxidation patent was granted to T. J. Smith, for T. du 
Motay, who heated ammonia and air with, for example, manganates, permanga-
nates, dichromates, and plumbates in a closed vessel at 300–5000C.3 Low yields 
of nitrogen oxides and nitrates were recovered. This patent was not very 
signiﬁcant but it did lead to later attempts covering the use of nonplatinic cata-
lysts, including bismuth oxide/copper oxide by Bayer4 and iron oxide/bismuth 
oxide, or a rare earth, by BASF.5 BASF emphasized the usefulness of bismuth 
oxide as a promoter.6 
Later, in the 1920s and the 1950s, further attempts were 
made to commercialize the use of cobalt oxide.7 Although the catalysts were 
often very active compared with platinum, they deactivated quickly and large 
volumes were needed for industrial applications. Apart from a very early plant 
in Leverkusen, in Germany, operated by Friedrich Bayer between 1914 and 
1918, none has been used on a large scale.8 The catalyst Bayer used was not 
known precisely but consisted mainly of iron oxides, with promoters such as

chromium, manganese, and bismuth. A 12-ft diameter bed of catalyst (5–10 mm 
granules), 6-in deep, was used and gave an overall efﬁciency of 80–85% at 700–
8500C. Iron oxide/bismuth oxide/manganese dioxide mixtures were studied as 
ammonia oxidation catalysts in the 1940s and were found to produce up to 80% 
yields of nitrous oxide between 300–4000C, but nitric oxide was formed at tem-
peratures above 4000C.9  
The most signiﬁcant early developments came when Professor Ostwald in 
Leipzig began his experiments on ammonia oxidation and published his results 
in 1902.10 The application for a German patent was disallowed because of 
Kuhlmann’s earlier patent. Ostwald had developed his interest following the 
encouragement of Professor Pfeffer at Bonn in response to Sir William Crookes’ 
address to the British Association in 1898. In 1909 Ostwald was awarded the 
Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his process, which was of vital importance in the 
production of fertilizer. He used platinum catalysts and obtained the best results 
with a coil of platinum foil as the catalyst at a very high linear gas velocity and 
removing the products from the tube as quickly as possible. He went on to 
deﬁne appropriate operating conditions in a pilot unit that gave 85% conversion 
and started a production unit at Bockum in May 1906 that produced 300 kg  
day-1. The life of 50 g of catalyst was 4–6 weeks.  
As a result of this success a second plant was built by 1908 giving a 53% 
yield and producing 3 tonnes day-1. Although the Ostwald process had the dis-
advantage of using a large amount of platinum and had poor temperature con-
trol,11 more or less the same conditions were used for about 30 years, but with 
many improvements in the plant design and the form of the catalyst.  
In 1911 Karl Kaiser introduced preheating of the air up to 300–4000C be-
fore passing it through four platinum gauzes in a square reactor. The gauze was 
a 1050 mesh of 0.06-mm wire that was alloyed with traces of palladium or iridi-
um and produced 1.5 tonnes of ammonia per square foot per day with a life of 
three months. This corresponded to 90–92% conversion in plants operating in 
Kharkoff, Russia, and in England.12  
Caro and Frank, who had been granted several patents by 1914,13 developed 
the ﬁrst process to be used on a large scale. The ﬁrst plant was built at the Bay-
erische Stickstoffwerke and was later engineered by BAMAG (Berlin An-
haltische Maschinenbau AG), who built 30 plants. The nitrogen oxides produced 
were initially used in the sulfuric acid lead chamber process but were eventually 
used to make all the nitric acid needed by Germany in the later stages of World 
War I. Following developments by BAMAG, three autothermal platinum gauzes 
of 80 mesh/in with 0.0026-in wire were used at 650–7500C with 10% ammonia 
in air and gave a 6-month lifetime. About 0.75 tonnes day-1 of ammonia per 
square foot of gauze was produced at 92% conversion in a plant operated at 
Hoechst by Meister, Lucius, and Bruning.14  
American Cyanamid operated the ﬁrst US plant in 1916 and the Air Nitrates 
Corporation  was  formed in  1917 to  build  700  nitric  acid  units and  produce

◦C, with 12% ammonia in air, and conversion in well-
designed plants exceeded 90%.  
The chemistry of the first stage in the overall process, reaction (4.1), is the 
exothermic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide and water.  The many reactions 
involved in the overall process to nitric acid may be simplified into three equa-
tions: the burning of ammonia to nitric oxide, reaction (4.2); the oxidation of 
nitric oxide, reaction (4.3); and the reaction of dinitrogen tetroxide to give nitric 
acid, reaction (4.4):

As demand for nitric acid increased, efforts were made to improve the pro-
cess by operation at higher pressures, which would allow the use of smaller 
equipment with lower capital costs. High pressure could also provide higher acid 
concentrations with more efﬁcient absorption and an increased rate of reaction 
in converting nitrogen oxides to nitric acid. High-pressure operation was made 
possible when chromium and chromium/nickel alloy steels replaced ceramic 
materials.  
The oxidation of ammonia, however, was less economic at high pressure 
than at atmospheric pressure because the burner temperatures had to be in-
creased in order to achieve the same selectivity. This led to shorter catalyst life 
as the metal gauzes deteriorated more rapidly and the loss of platinum became 
uneconomic. The 90% platinum/10% rhodium alloy introduced by DuPont 
solved this problem by reducing platinum loss by 50% and also improving selec-
tivity.17 
DuPont also found that the loss of platinum was proportional to the 
oxygen content of the gas mixture. It was realized that the surface of the catalyst 
etched as it was activated and the wires were covered by tinsel.  
Bimetallic gauzes not only improved the physical performance of the cata-
lyst to give a longer life but also increased the selectivity to more than 94%. 
There has been little change in operation since the 1930s, except that larger 
plants have been built. This has required better plant design and improved tem-
perature-resistant materials to support the larger-diameter gauzes used.  
 
4.1.1.  The Ammonia Oxidation Process  
 
Three types of ammonia oxidation processes are now used with absorption at 
atmospheric (AOP), intermediate (IOP), and high (POP) pressures. The interme-
diate-and high-pressure plant burners can also be operated at low pressure by 
incorporating gas compression before the absorber. Simplified flow sheets for 
typical ammonia oxidation plants are shown in Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.  Operat-
ing conditions for the different designs are given in Table 4.3. In general the 
burner efficiency is in the range 95–98% and the process chosen depends on the 
economic requirements of individual operators. Inlet gas to the burner is pre-
heated up to about 3000C with an ammonia concentration of less than 12% to 
avoid explosive mixtures and to ensure efﬁcient operation at high conversion. 
The gauze temperature, which is usually in the range 850–9500C, depends on the 
ammonia content, the preheating temperature, and the gas rate. At higher tem-
perature ammonia  can be  fully oxidized to  nitrogen and operating efficiency is

therefore reduced. Nitric oxide is thermodynamically unstable, and can revert to 
oxygen and nitrogen at elevated temperatures. Following the burner (the oxida-
tion reactor), the nitric oxide produced is cooled rapidly to a temperature below 
130oC so that much of the water formed in the elevated pressure process con-
denses, and the nitric oxide is not decomposed. Torn or poorly packed gauzes in 
the pad allow ammonia to pass through the pad unchanged and allow subsequent 
reaction with nitric oxide to produce nitrogen.  
 
4.1.2. Catalyst Operation  
 
The optimum pad thickness increases with operating pressure and 3–6, 10–20, 
and 35–45 gauzes are used in atmospheric, intermediate, and high pressure 
plants. Pads must be carefully ﬁtted to avoid tears or creases and laid ﬂat on a 
support of high-chrome steel mesh (Figure 4.5). New gauzes are free of lubri-
cants and iron contamination, but old gauzes can also be reused provided that 
they contain no holes and have been carefully cleaned and reactivated. Dust and 
other contamination is carefully removed and the gauze pickled in hydrochloric 
acid to remove iron oxide scale.  
Low-activity new gauze is always packed below used gauze because it does 
not reach full activity for several hours. The smooth surface of the wire becomes 
activated by the development of crystallites, which increases the surface area of 
platinum and exposes the more active crystallographic planes. This does, how-
ever, weaken the wires as platinum migrates and vaporizes to condense on lower 
layers of gauze or even be lost altogether from the pad. Platinum loss increases 
during high-pressure operation. The reasons for the deactivation of plati-
num/rhodium gauzes are not properly understood although the practical conse-
quences are all too clear (Figure 4.6).

of some of the platinum lost from the catalyst during operation. Platinum sludge 
formed in the absorber was relatively easy to separate. About 60% of the plati-
num could also be recovered from the burner gases with a suitable ﬁlter, alt-
hough this introduced a pressure drop in the system.  
Since about 1970 a new recovery system using a palladium getter gauze has 
been developed.21 This absorbs up to 80% of its weight of platinum as a plat-
inum/palladium alloy but does lose about 0.33 g of palladium for every gram of 
platinum collected. Up to 20% gold must be added to the palladium to provide 
physical strength. Several getter gauzes can be used to increase platinum recov-
ery to about 70%. A disadvantage of the procedure is the expense of recovering 
platinum and the other metals from spent getter gauzes.  
Since 1920 the platinum required to produce a given amout of nitric acid 
has fallen to less than 30% of the earlier levels a result of using catalysts with 
higher activity, greater selectivity, and longer operating lives. It is unlikely that 
better catalysts will be developed that can replace platinum/rhodium gauze.  
4.2. FORMALDEHYDE  
Formaldehyde has been well known as a disinfectant and preservative from 
early times and was originally obtained in low yields from special lamps by 
burning wood alcohol. As further practical applications were introduced, larger 
quantities were supplied from the partial combustion or selective oxidation of 
methanol.  
Hoffmann developed ﬂameless combustion of methanol in 1867. He used a 
platinum coil as a catalyst that glowed red hot as the methanol dehydrogenated 
and produced some formaldehyde.22 
A commercial plant was designed by Trillat 
in 1889 to convert a methanol/air mixture into formaldehyde using a platinized 
asbestos catalyst.23 Trillat subsequently showed that other catalysts could also be 
used, such as oxidized copper at 3300C, although platinum at 2000C was most 
effective. Yields of about 50% formaldehyde were produced and he claimed that 
the addition of 20% steam to the gases improved performance.  
During an investigation into the dehydrogenation and dehydration of alco-
hols, Sabatier and Maille dehydrogenated methanol over a number of metal 
oxides. In general the methanol was reformed to give carbon oxides and hydro-
gen, although some metals including copper did produce formaldehyde. They 
concluded that the Trillat process proceeded with a methanol dehydrogenation 
step followed by the reaction of the hydrogen formed with the excess oxygen 
present:  
 
 
2 CH3OH  →  2 HCHO  +  2 H2O 
(4.5) 
 
 
2 H2  +  O2  →  2 H2O 
(4.6) 
 
132 
Chapter 4 
The overall reaction is exothermic, and is a good early example of oxidative 
dehydrogenation. In reality, this is an example of selective oxidation: 
 
  
2 CH3OH + O2 → 2 HCHO + 2 H2O  
(4.7) 
 
Orlov studied the production of formaldehyde using a wide range of cata-
lysts and published a summary of his conclusions.24 He began by extending 
Sabatier’s conclusions and recommended the use of a copper catalyst. A plug of 
platinised asbestos was incorporated into the process gas stream before the cop-
per gauze; this acted as an ignition pellet, raising the temperature of the process 
gas before it came into contact with the main catalyst bed. Le Blanc and 
Plaschke showed that a silver catalyst was preferable to copper and worked out 
what they considered to be the best operating conditions.25 Bouliard26 and Le 
Blanc27 both recommended the use of silver supported on asbestos.  
Several commercial formaldehyde plants were operating after 1900 using 
both copper and silver catalysts. These included the Formal plant, Cote d’Or, 
France, which used long copper tubes,28 and theFHMeyer plant, Hanover-
Heinholz, based on Orlov’s work, with a copper reactor and copper or silver 
gauzes operating at 450–5000C.  
It has been suggested that the practical similarities between methanol and 
ammonia oxidation led to the more rapid development of platinum gauzes for 
nitric acid production during the 1914–1918 war.29 
Large-scale production of 
formaldehyde did not become important until the demand for phenol-
formaldehyde plastics developed in the 1920s. With so little information availa-
ble on the production of formaldehyde, it is more likely that the experience 
gained from ammonia oxidation in the wartime plants was then applied to the 
manufacture of formaldehyde.  
By the 1930s, Adkins, working with the Bakelite Corporation, introduced a 
mixed oxide catalyst for the direct oxidation of methanol.30 During the develop-
ment he found that pure molybdenum oxide gave about 60% conversion to for-
maldehyde at 4000C, although activity fell after 12–24 h to 30% conversion. 
Pure iron oxide, on the other hand, was not selective and produced only carbon 
dioxide. However, a mixed iron/molybdate catalyst converted more than 90% of 
the methanol to formaldehyde. Operation was relatively stable and by 1952 
DuPont had built a plant using iron/molybdate in a process similar to that de-
scribed in Adkins’ patent.31  
Several reviews of the commercial formaldehyde processes then available 
had been published by 1953 and gave summaries of the operating conditions 
used.31–33 Simplified flow sheets for both processes are shown in Figures 4.7 and 
4.8, and a photograph of a metal-oxide catalyzed plant is shown in Figure 4.9.  
Typical catalyst properties are given in Table 4.4.

4.2.1. Silver Catalyst Operation  
 
As demand for formaldehyde increased during the 1930s, processes using silver 
gauze or a layer of small silver granules as a catalyst were used almost exclu-
sively. The oxidative dehydrogenative process operates with a methanol-rich air 
mixture, and the methanol concentration must be greater than the upper ﬂamma-
bility limit. The feed gas must therefore contain more than 37% methanol and 
the oxygen content is inevitably less than the stoichiometric amount required for 
100% conversion of the methanol. Unreacted methanol is therefore recovered 
and recycled.  
Reactors consist of a 4-m wide catalyst bed, ﬁlled with a 3-cm layer of 0.5-
to 5-mm silver granules or a pack of silver gauzes. Space velocity through the 
bed is as high as 300,000 h-1 to minimize formaldehyde loss. Process gas at 560–
6800C must be rapidly cooled in a waste heat boiler immediately it leaves the 
reaction zone to avoid thermal decomposition of the product.  
Before use, the catalyst is activated in situ by the chemisorption of oxygen 
onto the silver surface. Oxygen, in the atomic state, then reacts with methanol to 
produce surface methoxy and hydroxyl species. Further methanol can react with 
these surface hydroxyl species to give more methoxy groups and free water. It 
has been suggested34 that the surface methoxy groups decompose to formalde-
hyde and hydrogen, suggesting the presence of equal amounts of formaldehyde 
and hydrogen in the process gas stream as is passes through the reactor. An 
alternative, or even simultaneous possibility is for surface methoxy groups to 
react with adjacent chemisorbed oxygen atoms giving formaldehyde and surface 
hydroxyl species. Low oxygen coverage is necessary to avoid further oxidation 
to formate ions and, ultimately, carbon dioxide. Silver is a more selective cata-
lyst than copper because it adsorbs less oxygen. A small volume of steam added 
to the feed can repress carbon formation, but its concentration is limited to main-
tain the ﬁnal product formaldehyde concentration.  
The product contains up to 50% formaldehyde after distillation. By recircu-
lating the vent gases, the operating temperature can be reduced and the methanol 
conversion increased. This results in an increase in the concentration of formal-
dehyde in the product to 55%. Methanol conversion is, however, limited to 70% 
in a single reactor. If a second reactor and additional air is added to give a higher 
methanol conversion, distillation can be avoided, although yields are reduced.  
 
4.2.2. Mixed Oxide Catalyst Operation  
 
The oxidative dehydrogenation process is highly exothermic and the reactor 
temperature must be controlled to maintain selectivity. The reactor consists of 
many tubes cooled by the circulation of a heat transfer ﬂuid such as Dowtherm. 
The catalyst tubes have a very small diameter to improve heat transfer and the

catalyst is usually supplied as rings to minimize pressure drop. Despite these 
precautions there is a higher temperature zone within the reactor that moves 
gradually to the bottom of the tube as the catalyst ages. The process operates just 
above atmospheric pressure and the required space velocity is in the range 
8000–10,000 h-1. The methanol content is always below its lower ﬂammability 
limit in air about 7%, and the methanol is completely converted. One of the 
main problems with this design is that there can be up to 40,000 catalyst tubes in 
a plant producing 35,000 tonnes year-1 of pure formaldehyde.35 This makes load-
ing and discharging catalyst a long job!  
Although the stoichiometric ratio of molybdenum to iron in ferric molyb-
date is 1.5, the maximum activity is obtained at an atomic ratio of 1.7. However, 
the presence of free ferric oxide in the catalyst is known to reduce considerably 
the selectivity of the catalyst to the formation of formaldehyde. For this reason, 
excess molybdenum is usually added to the catalyst formulation to maximize the 
yield of the product. The optimum ratio is about 2.0.35  
Some catalyst producers have made catalysts with a higher molybdenum-
iron ratio between 2.5–4.5, and the very high molybdenum content does affect 
the surface area and physical strength of the catalyst. Molybdenum oxide is 
quite volatile at high temperatures and the catalyst activity gradually decreases 
so that the high temperature zone, the position in the bed of maximum conver-
sion, gradually moves down the tube. The excess molybdenum is lost ﬁrst, so 
that there is no immediate loss in activity. Catalyst dust, however, deposits on 
active catalyst at the bottom of the tubes, resulting in an increase in pressure 
drop.  
The catalyst is prepared by precipitation from solutions of ferric chloride 
and ammonium molybdate. The precipitate may not be homogeneous, with 
signiﬁcant variations within a single batch. Hydrothermal aging of the precipi-
tate may be necessary to provide a more uniform composition. Precipitation of 
the catalyst as a gel provides a more uniform ferric molybdate composition.  
Additives such as chromium or cobalt oxides can stabilize the catalyst. In 
Table 4.5, catalyst compositions and operating conditions in modern formalde-
hyde processes are shown.  
4.3. ANDRUSSOV SYNTHESIS OF HYDROGEN CYANIDE  
Hydrogen cyanide is used in a number of industrial processes, including the 
manufacture of methylmethacrylate (MMA). The elegant synthesis of MMA by 
John Crawford of ICI in 1932 was made possible by the Andrussov process, 
which was introduced in the early 1930s.36 
The polymerization of MMA produc-
es the plastic, Perspex, the trademark registered by ICI in November 1934. This 
acrylic was used in the manufacture of the lightweight canopies required for the 
Spitﬁre ﬁghter plane, which ﬁrst ﬂew in 1936 and which was widely used during

The Andrussov Process for the manufacture of hydrogen cyanide by am-
moxidation of methane is now widely used: 
 
 
CH4 + NH3 + 1.5 O2 → HCN + 3 H2O  
(4.8) 
 
Air is the usual oxidant and while natural gas is the most common source of 
hydrocarbons, by-product gases from other units such as an ethylene plant can 
also be used. 
The original catalyst, still widely used, is essentially the same as that devel-
oped for ammonia oxidation. Leonid Andrussov had previously worked out the 
reaction mechanism for ammonia oxidation with Bodenstein in 1926 and inves-
tigated the process for many years.37  
Andrussov’s catalyst was a platinum/rhodium gauze that contained up to 
10% rhodium, although he did originally think that 2–3% iridium was better. A 
typical reaction mixture contained 11.2% ammonia, 11.7% methane, 15.6% 
oxygen, and 61.2% nitrogen, with traces of ethane.38 Reaction was adiabatic 
with a hot spot in the range 900–11000C, at a linear velocity of 2–4 ft s-1. This 
gave an ammonia conversion in the range 60–65%. The actual temperature and 
conversion depended on the composition of feed gas.  
Nowadays, while reaction conditions are more or less the same, seven to ten 
layers of gauze are used to ensure that the gauze is uniformly heated, and to 
avoid carbon deposition. The process operates at about 70% conversion and 
requires rapid cooling. As in ammonia oxidation, the surface of the platinum 
alloy is etched as it is activated.39 Metal foil catalysts have often been formed 
from expanded sheets 
Catalysts prepared by supporting platinum/rhodium on an inert support have 
also been used in shallow beds.40 These catalysts are stronger at high tempera-
ture than gauzes. Supports include zirconia, beryl, and silicon carbide. Varia-

tions in the quality of solid supports can, however, lead to changes in perfor-
mance. Supported catalysts also need pretreatment to roughen the surface. Plati-
num/rhodium supported on beryl, when used with a platinum/rhodium gauze, 
has been claimed to have a longer life than either catalyst used alone, giving 
yields of HCN in the range 68–70% for at least 60 days.41  
Catalyst activity falls by 4–5% during the operating life as a result of losing 
active metal, tearing of the gauzes, poisoning, poor gas distribution, or thermal 
degradation of the support. Performance can be improved by ﬁltering the feed 
gas and removing any organometallic compounds that may be present in the 
feed. Heavy metals, arsenic, and phosphorus are common permanent poisons, 
but poisoning due to high levels of sulfur is reversible.  
4.4.  HOPCALITE CATALYSTS FOR CARBON MONOXIDE 
OXIDATION  
Some early catalysts are no longer used in the application for which they were 
developed. They do, however, often have an important bearing on subsequent 
catalyst and process development. One important example is the use of Hop-
calite catalysts during the 1914–1918 war. Carbon monoxide, highly toxic and 
not easily detectable, was generated inside tanks, and during the ﬁring of naval 
cannons and machine guns. There was, therefore, an urgent demand for efﬁcient 
catalysts that could oxidize carbon monoxide at ambient temperature for use in 
gas masks.  
The pre-1817 experiments of Davy and Erman,42 followed by those of 
Fletcher,43 had shown that coal gas could ignite over platinum or hot iron wire at 
low temperatures giving ﬂameless combustion. In 1902 the work was continued 
by Bone,44 and during the 1914–1918 war several oxides were identiﬁed that 
promoted combustion at temperatures below 200C. These included copper oxide, 
manganese dioxide, silver oxide, and cobalt oxide, as well as palladium metal. 
Mixed oxides were even more active, particularly if a promoter such as ceria 
was included.  
The composition of the catalysts used in respirators by British and Ameri-
can soldiers was as follows:  
• British: Mixed CuO/MnO2 plus 1–5% cerium oxide.45  
• US Chemical Warfare Service: CuO 30%, MnO2 50%, Co2O3 15%, AgO 
5%.46  
The US catalyst was known as Hopcalite 1 and, later, the more active Hop-
calite 2 containing 60% MnO2, 40% CuO, was introduced.47  
The oxidation of carbon monoxide is strongly exothermic, and even at car-
bon monoxide concentrations as low as 2%, the heat produced made the puriﬁed 
gas too hot to breathe. A cooler containing low-melting sodium thiosulphate 
140 
Chapter 4 
was, therefore, incorporated into the gas mask, the latent heat of fusion of sodi-
um thiosulphate being sufﬁcient to cool the air to an acceptable temperature. 
Catalysts were sensitive to moisture so a replaceable desiccant was also needed 
to dry the air entering the respirator.  
As with later oxidation catalysts, Hopcalites were prepared by mixing fresh-
ly precipitated oxides. Silver was added by impregnating the oxides with a silver 
salt and precipitating the oxide with alkali.  
A full review of carbon monoxide oxidation has been given by Katz,48 
who 
noted that the development of Hopcalites had produced very active multicompo-
nent catalysts. The silver and manganese oxides used were often nonstoichio-
metric and able to lose or gain oxygen, depending on the temperature and pres-
sure. He also suggested a probable reaction mechanism involving the oxidation 
of adsorbed carbon monoxide by lattice oxygen and the subsequent adsorption 
and activation of molecular oxygen by the catalyst to regenerate the lattice. It 
follow that surface defects and weaker oxygen bonds were important for the 
exchange of surface ions and electrons. Huttig had already reported at a Faraday 
Society meeting that oxygen ions on the surface of Cr2O3 and other oxides are 
mobile. At the same meeting Taylor, Rideal, and Garner discussed the relation-
ship between chemisorption and heterogeneous catalysis.49  
The academic interest in mixed oxides and catalysts between 1930 and 1950 
clearly promoted the understanding and development of oxidation catalysts. 
Many improved formulations had, of course, been gradually developed by large-
ly empirical methods for organic oxidation processes from the 1940s, and these 
led to the redox reaction mechanism proposed by Mars and van Krevelen in 
1954.50 
 
These developments would undoubtedly have taken place in the fullness of 
time without the need for wartime gas masks, but this is just another good ex-
ample of how general theories and improved industrial catalysts develop from 
early, often random, experiments.  
4.5. PHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE  
The oxidation of organic compounds to useful products was not reported ex-
tensively until the 1920s. Before then, any hot combustible material mixed with 
air passing over a catalyst produced mainly oxides of carbon.  
A number of low-activity catalysts that could control oxidation to some ex-
tent were eventually identiﬁed. These were metal oxides from Groups V and VI, 
such as vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten, particularly when mixed with 
phosphoric, arsenic, or boric acids. Oxidation was controlled by choosing the 
appropriate temperature and contact time. At ﬁrst it was difﬁcult to achieve 
reasonable selectivity when dealing with exothermic reactions.  
 
 
 
Oxidation Catalysts

A review of the work up to 1920 was produced by Weiss and Downs,51 of 
the Barrett Company, who were among the ﬁrst to investigate the catalytic oxi-
dation of naphthalene. Weiss remained an active consultant until at least 1946.  
 
4.5.1. Naphthalene Oxidation  
 
Although BASF are said to have produced phthalic anhydride by oxidizing 
naphthalene as early as 1916,52 the ﬁrst serious investigations were described by 
H. D. Gibbs and his associates at the US Bureau of Chemistry. Gibbs and 
Condover were granted a large number of patents from 1917 for the production 
of phthalic anhydride from naphthalene.53   
 
Further patents were also granted to the Seldon Company,54 Wohl,55 Weiss 
and Downs56 and Craver (Barrett Co).57 It is interesting to note that much of the 
published information ﬁrst became available in the form of patents. Gibbs and 
Condover did, however, summarize their work in a number of papers and 
speciﬁed the use of both vanadium and molybdenum oxide catalysts.58 Tests 
showed that vanadium pentoxide could produce yields of up to 85%, whereas 
molybdenum trioxide required higher temperatures and, only gave yields up to 
50– 60%. Tungstic oxide was not very active. It was found that fused vanadium 
pentoxide gave the best results when it was supported on a range of low-surface-
area materials such as kieselguhr, pumice, asbestos, or even metallic alumi-
num.59 
Craver recommended a mixture of 65% vanadium pentoxide and 35% 
molybdenum trioxide with traces of manganese dioxide or copper oxide.57  
Operating temperatures were in the range 400–4500C with contact times 
less than 0.5 s, although reaction did begin in the temperature range 270–2800C. 
By 1928 large quantities of phthalic anhydride were being made commercially 
in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.60 It was recognized that 
tubular reactors or a number of shallow adiabatic beds should be used to control 
the hot spot that developed in the catalyst.61 
Temperature was controlled to 
maintain selectivity by cooling adiabatic beds with a cold air quench or in tubu-
lar reactors by heat exchange with a suitable liquid. Surprisingly, adiabatic cata-
lyst beds were preferred until the 1940s, although Downs did investigate the use 
of square tubes in a 3-ft diameter vessel.62 The catalyst was cooled by liquid 
mercury surrounding the tubes, the mercury boiling point being controlled by 
changes in the pressure of the bath. Tubular catalytic reactors cooled by eutectic 
salt mixtures were also developed, but generally the use of adiabatic catalyst 
beds continued.  
Up to about 1945 the typical naphthalene oxidation catalyst was fused va-
nadium pentoxide, sometimes combined with molybdenum trioxide, on an inert 
support. At that time US production of phthalic anhydride was probably less 
than 60,000 tonnes year-1 and catalyst quality was not very important.  
Over a period of time, the introduction of alkali sulfates to moderate the re-
action led to some improvements in selectivity.63 The developments may have 
142 
Chapter 4 
been derived from studies on the vanadium catalysts used commercially in the 
oxidation of sulphur dioxide. It was discovered that the alkali metal sulphates 
and pyrosulphates formed complexes with vanadium pentoxide. In 1944 the 
success of the Badger/Sherwin Williams ﬂuid bed process using naphthalene as 
feedstock, conﬁrmed the activity and stability of these catalysts. Improved oper-
ation with a richer feed gas and better temperature control gave 90% selectivity 
at almost 100% conversion. Typical operating conditions at the time are shown 
in Table 4.6. 
 
4.5.2. Orthoxylene Oxidation  
 
As the petrochemical industry developed orthoxylene became widely available 
as a feedstock for phthalic anhydride. In the 1940s, Chevron became the ﬁrst 
company to manufacture phthalic anhydride commercially by the oxidation of o-
xylene, obtained as a by-product from a hydroforming plant. As o-xylene be- 
came available from platformers and demand for phthalic anhydride increased, 
it became the major feedstock. About 90% of the phthalic anhydride used in 
1990 was produced from o-xylene.

BASF and then von Heyden introduced new processes using tubular reac-
tors with either naphthalene or o-xylene as feed. This design proved to be ex-
tremely successful in Europe during the 1950s and is still widely used. Scientiﬁc 
Design also introduced a similar, successful tubular reactor design in North 
America. The Badger/Sherwin Williams benzene catalyst was not selective 
when used with o-xylene feed and the ﬂuid bed process soon became obsolete. 
A new catalyst was soon being used for o-xylene oxidation. About 10 wt% of 
mixed vanadium pentoxide and titania (anatase) was supported on a rugged 
cordierite support. Alumina and phosphates were also included as promoters. 
The form and quantity of vanadium used was claimed to control the catalyst 
activity, and by using more than one catalyst the hot-spot temperature could be 
minimized. Catalyst shape evolved from granules to spheres and the preferred 
shape is now small rings. Operation at 375–4000C gave a selectivity of about 
75–80%. Precise temperature control allowed use of the maximum o-xylene/air 
ratio.  
The inclusion of titania was believed to inhibit the desorption of the many 
intermediates involved in the overall reaction65 and is now a key component of 
the preferred o-xylene oxidation catalyst.  
Titanium dioxide catalysts were ﬁrst described in the 1940s and 1950s, 
when mixed oxide catalysts were being investigated and used in a number of 
oxidation reactions. Mixtures of vanadium pentoxide with titanium dioxide gave 
better operation and longer life as phthalic anhydride demand increased. An 
early catalyst that did not sinter and clearly increased the stability of vanadium 
pentoxide was described in a patent as TiO(VO3)2.66 At about the same time 
vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous pentoxide mixtures were also being developed 
for use in maleic anhydride processes.  
A common feature of the new vanadium catalysts, including those used in 
sulfuric acid production, was the need to reduce pentavalent vanadium by reac-
tion with hydrochloric or oxalic acid solutions before the active compounds that 
improved catalyst performance were formed. It was well known, especially from 
sulfuric acid catalysts, that tetravalent vanadium also formed during operation.  
Titanium dioxide in the form of anatase provides a suitable surface on 
which the vanadyl ions can react with hydroxyl groups. This forms pseudotetra-
hedral groups giving a theoretical monolayer. The layer is a two-dimensional 
sheet corresponding to the formula VO2.5, which despite the stoichiometry, is 
believed to contain both strongly bound tetravalent and pentavalent vanadium. 
Up to about 10% vanadium pentoxide can combine with titanium dioxide, de-
pending on its surface area, and any vanadium pentoxide that is not part of the 
monolayer forms crystals on the catalyst during the ﬁnal stages of catalyst prep-
aration. Both of the valence states take part in the oxidation of o-xylene by a 
typical redox mechanism.67

4.6. MALEIC ANHYDRIDE  
4.6.1. Benzene Feedstock  
 
Benzene oxidation using a vanadium pentoxide/pumice catalyst was ﬁrst studied 
at the time that the phthalic anhydride process was being developed. Weiss and 
Downs discovered that maleic anhydride was formed in signiﬁcant amounts.51 
 
They concluded that the maleic anhydride was produced via benzoquinone as 
the intermediate. The yields of maleic anhydride were not high with the unselec-
tive vanadium or molybdenum oxide catalysts being tested at that time.  
The ﬁrst commercial production unit was built by the National Aniline and 
Chemical Company, part of the Barrett Company, in 1933. However, most of 
the maleic anhydride used at that time was supplied from phthalic anhydride 
plants, which produced about 5–10% as a by-product. Demand for maleic anhy-
dride was still low during the 1940s. At that time two typical catalysts were 
available. One contained 12% vanadium pentoxide/4% molybdenum trioxide 
supported on α-alumina, while the other contained 10% vanadium pentoxide 
moderated with less than 1% of lithium sulfate/sodium sulfate, also supported on 
α-alumina. The alkali sulfate moderated catalyst was, however, sensitive to 
sulfur poisons in the benzene feed.  
A mixed oxide catalyst containing 13% titanium dioxide plus molybdenum 
trioxide and tungstic oxide supported on low-surface area α-alumina was devel-
oped by DuPont for butene-2 oxidation68 in 1952.  
In general, catalysts were prepared by dissolving and reducing the oxides in 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, adding the corundum granules and evaporating 
the liquid before calcining to decompose the chlorides. Oxalic acid was often 
included to act as glue, enabling the catalyst to become more ﬁrmly ﬁxed to the 
support.  
By 1955, Montedison had published sales literature to describe their MAT 5 
catalyst which was still based on supported vanadium pentoxide/molybdenum 
trioxide.69 
The composition of MAT 5 is shown in Table 4.7. A life of between 
two and three years was claimed, depending on the poisons present in the ben-
zene used,  before the pass  yield fell from 72% to about 65%.  Decreased  selec-
tivity may also have depended on the amount of molybdenum lost at the higher 
operating temperature required to maintain conversion.  
 
4.6.2. n-Butene Feedstock  
 
Prior to 1960 benzene was the only feed used to produce maleic anhydride. 
From 1962, however, the Petrotex Chemical Corporation began to use n-butene 
feed in its plant in Houston, Texas.70

with other mixed oxide compounds such as V9Mo6O40.The β-bronze could possibly stabilize the other active 
compounds and limit loss of molybdena during operation. M. Najbar, Preparation of Catalysts IV, , Elsevier, 
Amsterdam, 1987, p. 217. 
 
 
The n-butene feed was supplied by the dehydrogenation of n-butane and the 
plant began the trend to develop oxidation processes using aliphatic petrochemi-
cal hydrocarbons. The main incentive, of course, was to use surplus C4 hydro-
carbon from steam cracking. This not only used a cheap by-product gas, but the 
reaction was less complicated because the straight-chain C4 molecule contained 
fewer carbon atoms than aromatic benzene.  
The mixed vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous pentoxide (with niobium, copper, 
lithium promoters) catalyst used by Petrotex was, at the time, a further step 
change in the catalyst types used for hydrocarbon oxidation.71 It also eventually 
contributed to a better understanding of the catalyst structures used in oxidation 
reactions. The catalyst must have evolved from the accumulated experience 
obtained with a variety of  mixed  oxide catalysts and had a  composition similar 
to that shown in Table 4.8. Distillers patented a molybdenum triox-
ide/phosphorous pentoxide catalyst,72 and the Atlantic Reﬁning Company took 
out a patent for a vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous pentoxide catalyst 
speciﬁcally for butene-2 oxidation.73 The vanadium pentoxide catalyst gave 
higher yields.

As new mixed oxide catalysts were introduced for industrial oxidation pro-
cesses in the period from 1950 to 1965 it was difﬁcult to recognize a pattern of 
performance. The relationship between the original catalysts used to produce 
phthalic and maleic anhydrides and the new efﬁcient catalysts being developed 
for acrolein and acrylonitrile processes is easier to see now substantial research, 
both industrial and academic, has led to a better understanding of the reactions. 
The vital piece in the catalyst jigsaw puzzle came when Mars and van Krevelen 
recognized that mixed oxide catalysis generally proceeded by a redox mecha-
nism. Hydrocarbons reacted with lattice oxygen from one oxide, which was 
subsequently reoxidized by oxygen supplied by the second oxide.74  
An interesting practical feature of all mixed oxide catalysts is the very sim-
ple preparation from the appropriate ingredients. Maleic anhydride catalyst is 
prepared as follows:  
• Dissolve vanadium pentoxide in concentrated hydrochloric acid and 
reﬂux to reduce V5+ to V4+ forming a blue-green solution.  
• Add phosphoric acid with an organic solvent such as isobutanol to precip-
itate the catalyst.  
• Add support and evaporate to dryness.  
• Calcine the catalyst to remove hydrochloric acid and chloride.  
• Promoters such as lithium, zinc, or molybdenum may also be added as 
appropriate to the original vanadium solution.

Chapter 4 
The catalyst precursor decomposes at a lower temperature under reaction 
conditions, and the catalyst is more active when normal or isobutanol is used as 
the organic solvent. Tests under reaction conditions show that maleic anhydride 
begins to form at 3880C, when the precursor decomposes. A final step of crystal-
lization takes place as maximum conversion is reached at 390–4000C. The active 
catalyst has the same particle morphology as the precursor when examined by 
scanning electron microscopy.75  
The original Petrotex plant was reconverted back to a benzene feed in 1967 
suggesting that they may not have had access to the latest catalysts. Early pa-
tents claimed a pass yield of about 50% but operational results seem not to have 
been published.76 Other plants, operated by BASF77 and Bayer,78 also used n-
butene feed and proprietary catalysts from about 1969 and functioned until the 
1980s. The Bayer plant used a range of gradually improved catalysts and in-
creased the yield of maleic anhydride from 59 lb in 1975 to 70 lb in 1981, based 
on 100 lb of feed containing 75% butenes.79 Catalysts in these plants were also 
thought to be based on vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous pentoxide composi-
tions with some titania and a steatite support.80 
There was a move to use ﬂuid 
bed reactors in 1970 by Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd. A mixed C4 stream 
was used as a feed and only the butenes were converted to maleic anhydride. No 
catalyst details were published, although a vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous 
pentoxide formulation must have been used.77,81  
 
4.6.3. n-Butane Feedstock  
 
Monsanto and Alusuisse both introduced processes using n-butane as feed in 
1974. The overall reaction is: 
 
 
 
C4H10  +  7/2 O2  →  C4H2O3  +  4 H2O   
(4.12) 
 
Despite the need to operate at a higher temperature with a relatively low conver-
sion and lower yield, n-butane was more attractive than n-butene because it was 
cheaper. It is now being used more widely.  
Since 1980 several plant operators and contractors have developed ﬂuidized 
bed reactors to oxidize n-butane feed. One of the ﬁrst was Badger, using a Mobil 
catalyst, at the Denka plant (originally Petrotex) in Houston.82 
Badger estimated 
that the ﬂuid bed butane process would require only 64% of the capital invest-
ment needed for a conventional plant. Since then several other ﬂuidized bed 
processes have been introduced, including a Sohio/UCB plant near Cleveland, 
Ohio83 and a BP/Mitsui Toatsu plant in Japan. The Alusuisse/Lummus Crest 
process began pilot plant operation in Italy in 1983 and has since been licensed 
to several companies throughout the world from 1987.84  
By injecting butane and air separately, ﬂuidized beds allow the use of an in-
let concentration of butane that is higher than the ﬂammable limit. The same 
 
 
 
Oxidation Catalysts

catalysts are used as in n-butene oxidation. Operating conditions for the oxida-
tion of n-butane in the conventional Alusuisse ﬂuid bed and the DuPont circulat-
ing ﬂuid bed process described in the next Section are given in Table 4.9.  
 
4.6.4. n-Butane Oxidation in a Circulating Fluidized Bed  
 
A signiﬁcant technological advance was made by DuPont in 1986 when maleic 
anhydride was produced from n-butane in a circulating ﬂuidized bed.85 In this 
process, active catalyst reacts with butene to give maleic anhydride, itself be-
coming reduced in the process. The overall reaction is: 
 
 
 
C4H8  +  3 O2  →  C4H2O3  +  3 H2O 
         (4.13) 
 
Reduced catalyst is then reoxidized with air, in a separate regeneration reactor, 
to regenerate the active form. This innovation followed the successful introduc-
tion of conventional fluidized bed operation by Alusuisse and other companies 
in 1983. Physical circulation of a ﬂuidized bed of catalyst particles, or micro-
spheres, is an unusual technology and has been developed commercially only for 
the ﬂuid catalytic cracking of heavy gas oils and the SASOL version of the 
Fischer–Tropsch Synthol process. Success depends not only on an active and 
selective catalyst but also on the resistance of the catalyst to attrition during the 
transfer from the reactor to the regenerator and back again.  
The DuPont process is based on a practical application of the Mars and van 
Krevelen redox mechanism in a reducing ﬂuidized bed reactor followed by an 
oxidizing regenerator.86 During reaction, lattice oxygen from the ﬂuidized cata-
lyst selectively converts an n-butane feed to maleic acid with almost no carbon 
dioxide formation. Then, when the ﬂuidized bed of the reduced catalyst passes 
through the regenerator, it is reoxidized with air before re-entering the reactor.

By separating the catalyst reduction and oxidation stages of the redox pro-
cess, and avoiding the possibility of explosion, there are no practical restrictions 
on the concentration of butane during reaction or to the concentration of air 
during the reoxidation of oxygen-depleted surface sites. During operation 
(VO)2P2O7 catalyst is, therefore, always in the optimum form, with the average 
valency of the vanadium component slightly greater than four. Operating tem-
perature is similar to that of other conventional processes, although the pressure 
is somewhat higher as a result of having to circulate a ﬂuid bed. Lower water 
production in the reaction zone makes product recovery easier at 300C. 
Throughput can be increased by 10% with 20% higher yield.  
The catalyst microspheres are approximately 40–150 m in diameter. Ade-
quate strength for use in the circulating ﬂuid bed is obtained by spray drying a 
slurry of small, 0.5–2 m, (VO)2P2O7 particles with 5% of polysilicic acid at pH 
3. During this process silica forms a hard porous shell over the surface of the 
catalyst particles.  
4.7. ETHYLENE OXIDE  
Ethylene oxide was ﬁrst produced by BASF and Union Carbide in 1916 and 
1923, respectively, via the chlorhydrin route: 
 
 
 
CH2=CH2 + HOCl → HOCH2CH2Cl 
(4.14) 
 
 
 
 
 
HOCH2CH2Cl → CH2–CH2 + HCl 
(4.15) 
 
O 
 
This process used chlorine that could not easily be recovered, so attempts were 
made to develop a catalyst for direct oxidation  The reaction is  
 
 
 
 
 
C2H4  +  ½ O2  →  (CH2)2O 
(4.16) 
 
Lefort87 was successful in 1930
 and he subsequently assigned his patents to the 
Union Carbide corporation, which commissioned the ﬁrst large-scale direct 
oxidation plant at South Charleston, West Virginia, during 1938–1939. The 
success of this plant led Scientiﬁc Design to develop an air oxidation process in 
1953,88 followed by Shell, using oxygen, in 1955.89 Operating conditions for 
both processes are given in Table 4.10.  
 
Modern processes operate reactors with the catalyst packed into 1- to 2-in 
tubes that are cooled by suitable heat transfer liquids: 
• The air oxidation process uses a reaction mixture containing 4% ethylene 
and 6% oxygen,  with the balance being  nitrogen.  This is passed through

the catalyst tubes and then the product absorber. Ethylene and air are 
added to maintain the reactor inlet composition so a purge is necessary to 
remove inerts. The purge gas passes through a second reactor to recover 
the residual ethylene, which can be as much as 20% of the initial feed. 
The second purge reactor may take purge gas from several main reactors. 
• When using pure oxygen the reaction mixture can contain about 15–20% 
ethylene, 6% oxygen, and 15–30% methane, with the balance being an 
inert gas such as carbon dioxide. After the product has been absorbed the 
carbon dioxide/methane mixture is recirculated, with appropriate makeup 
of ethylene and oxygen. No purge is necessary. To maintain the correct 
feed gas composition, carbon dioxide is simply stripped from the circulat-
ing gas and vented. There is no need for a second reactor to recover eth-
ylene. A very brief review of early industrial patents was given by Huck-
nall.90 
 
• Since the Hucknall review, which dates back to 1974, there have been 
many substantial developments in the ethylene oxide process arising from 
separate contributions from companies such as Union Carbide, Shell and 
ICI. These improvements include the addition of ppm quantities of chlo-
ride to the process gas stream, the addition of alkali metal with potassium 
and to a lesser extent, caesium being preferred, and advances in the prep-
aration of the support involving the addition of hydroﬂuoric acid and ace-
tic acid prior to calcinations to control the morphology of the α-alumina. 
This sequence in process developments resulted in an improvement in se-
lectivity from around 65% to about 83%, thus reducing signiﬁcantly the 
amount of carbon dioxide formed, particularly in fresh catalysts. As the 
catalyst aged and activity fell, the operating temperature had to be raised 
slightly to maintain conversion, and this resulted in a gradual and ongoing 
fall in selectivity. When the selectivity eventually fell to about 78% after 
152 
Chapter 4 
a period of two to three years, it became more economic to replace the 
catalyst.  
• The addition of NOx to the process gas was found to increase selectivity 
even further, and with careful selection of the methods of preparation of 
the support, the addition of the silver and potassium components and the 
catalyst pre-conditioning procedures, it was possible to achieve selectivi-
ties in the range 90–93% It is interesting to observe that in the earlier pro-
cess, the combustion of ethylene to carbon dioxide generated so much 
heat that the overall process, including product recovery and puriﬁcation, 
was a nett exporter of steam, that is, by-product energy. In contrast, as on-
ly a small amount of ethylene is wasted at the high selectivities achieved 
in the NOX promoted process, the process is a net importer of energy. 
However, combustion of ethylene to fuel a boiler is hardly the most eco-
nomic way to provide energy!!  
 
4.7.1. Catalyst  
 
The same catalyst can be used in both air and oxygen processes. In the early 
catalysts about 10–15% silver was deposited on a low-surface-area support such 
as α-alumina or silicon carbide. The nature of the support is critical. Low sur-
face area α-alumina is normally used. Any residual acidity in the support pro-
motes the isomerisation of ethylene oxide to acetaldehyde, a key intermediate in 
the formation of carbon dioxide, and hence low selectivity. All γ-alumina must 
be converted to α-alumina during calcination. Silver lactate solution plus an 
alkaline earth lactate could be used to coat the preformed support.91 Metallic 
silver formed as the catalyst was dried and then calcined. Suitable supports in-
clude small spheres or rings with a pore volume about 0.5 ml g-1. Up to 2% of an 
alkaline earth promoter such as barium may have been added to the catalyst. 
Further details are shown in Table 4.11.

The high cost of ethylene is such that even quite small improvements in cat-
alyst selectivity offer substantial savings to the ethylene oxide producer. High 
selectivity is, therefore, commercially very valuable to the catalyst producer. 
The patent situation regarding ethylene oxide catalysts is so congested and com-
plex that it is extremely difﬁcult for the companies to guarantee adequate protec-
tion for their work, or even to recognize and prove that infringement of their 
rights has taken place. Consequently, speciﬁc details of the preparation of cur-
rent commercial catalysts are therefore almost never available in the open litera-
ture.  
 
4.7.2. Operation and Reaction Mechanism  
 
During operation of early catalysts it was usual to limit the conversion of eth-
ylene both to achieve maximum selectivity and to control the evolution of heat. 
A short contact time was required and conversion was limited to about 8–10%. 
The ethylene content of the feed gas was close to the lower ﬂammability limit.  
The reaction mechanism was suggested by Sachtler et al. to proceed by ad-
sorption of molecular oxygen directly onto the silver surface, where it reacts 
with ethylene:92  
 
 
[Ag] + O2 → [Ag]O2  
(4.17) 
 
 
[Ag]O2 + C2H4 → C2H4O + [Ag]O  
(4.18) 
 
The adsorbed atomic oxygen that remains on the silver surface does not re-
act with ethylene to produce more ethylene oxide but instead forms oxides of 
carbon:  
 
 
6 [Ag]O + C2H4 → 6 [Ag] + 2 H2O + 2 CO2  
(4.19) 
 
The catalyst surface is, therefore, continuously oxidized by oxygen and then 
reduced by ethylene during operation. Only six out of every seven ethylene 
molecules form ethylene oxide, so that the maximum selectivity allowed by the 
Sachtler mechanism is only 85.7%.  
The Sachtler mechanism did not take into account the critical role of chlo-
ride, and with high selectivities now being regularly and reliably reported, it 
clearly no longer satisﬁed the latest information, particularly when NOx is used 
as a moderator in the feed gas, and selectivities in excess of 90% are achieved. 
Further contributions to this debate were clearly required by the industry and 
academy alike.  
Van Santen93 proposed an alternative mechanism in which molecular oxy-
gen on the silver surface ﬁrst dissociates to give atomic oxygen species. He 
suggested that only weakly bound oxygen atoms interact with ethylene to give 
154 
Chapter 4 
the ethylene oxide precursor. This occurred preferentially when both oxygen and 
chloride atoms competed for the same silver site. The role of the alkali metal, 
potassium, was believed to stabilise an oxychloride ionic species.  
Silver is in the form of spherical particles that can change size during opera-
tion. Particles smaller than 0.1 μ sinter and larger particles seem to break up as 
the size stabilizes. The equilibrium silver particle size is reached faster by the 
addition of the alkali metal promoter to the catalyst and is less than 1 m, the 
typical diameter94 of the pores with the alumina.  
The reaction of ethylene with adsorbed oxygen atoms to form carbon diox-
ide is inhibited by adding a few parts per million of ethylene dichloride to the 
process gas. The chlorine atoms cover a signiﬁcant proportion of the silver sur-
face, and the rate of oxygen adsorption is reduced. This can deactivate the cata-
lyst. Moreover, at high levels of chloride in the process gas, the catalyst eventu-
ally becomes chlorided and thus deactivated. The alkaline promoter in the cata-
lyst can store chlorine and help control deactivation, but it can also lead to a 
small decrease in selectivity. The effect of chlorine on silver can be reversed by 
the addition of methane or ethane to the feed.95 
 
The beneﬁcial effect of ethylene dichloride was discovered accidentally at 
Union Carbide in the 1940s when it was a trace impurity in the air at Charleston, 
West Virginia. Careful work determined that occasional bursts of ethylene di-
chloride, present with more than 200 other impurities, improved operation, and 
it has been added as a promoter in controlled quantities ever since.96  
Typical operating selectivity varies in the ranges 65–75% and 70–83% for 
the air and oxygen processes, respectively.  
 
4.7.3. Applications of Ethylene Oxide  
 
Demand for ethylene oxide has increased rapidly in the second half of the 20th 
century as ethylene has been produced by steam cracking and more importantly 
new applications for ethylene glycol have been introduced. About 60% of the 
total ethylene oxide produced is converted to ethylene glycol by hydrolysis in an 
excess of water at temperatures exceeding 1400C and about 20–30 atm pressure. 
About 1% of sulfuric acid can be added as a catalyst. Selectivity is only about 
90% as diethylene glycol and small amounts of glycol ethers also form during 
the reaction. Increasing amounts of polyvinyl alcohol are formed at low water 
concentrations.  
The earliest important use of ethylene glycol was as antifreeze in automo-
bile engines, but it had also been used earlier, converted to the dinitrate, as a 
component in low-freezing dynamite. Nowadays it is used mainly in the produc-
tion of polyesters.  
Ethylene oxide is used in a variety of other applications such as nonionic 
surfactants, ethanolamines, and glycol ethers.

different structures discovered can be very active catalysts.107 Thomas and Thomas suggest that 
bismuth oxide can be a solvent for many other metal oxides. Others have tried to establish that a

4.8.  
A REDOX OXIDATION MECHANISM: MARS AND VAN 
KREVELEN  
The introduction of new vanadium pentoxide/phosphorous pentoxide and vana-
dium pentoxide/titania catalysts to meet the increasing demand for maleic anhy-
dride and phthalic anhydride was a huge step forward in catalyst development. It 
is hard to tell in retrospect whether the discoveries were made by trial and error 
or as part of a focused research effort. Even the catalyst suppliers do not admit 
to or remember a sudden breakthrough. Nevertheless the understanding of cata-
lyst design and improved physical testing coincided with the escalating demand 
for petrochemicals to produce better catalysts. During this period a number of 
apparently random experimental results that had been accumulating since the 
1920s gradually began to make sense (see Table 4.12).  
From experience in providing oxidation catalyst samples similar to those 
produced by Petrotex and von Heyden it seems almost certain that tentative 
formulations were developed before a theory evolved. There was certainly very 
little prior disclosure of catalysts and only a few patents before the 1960s, alt-
hough active catalysts could be produced very easily. As the multitude of later 
156 
Chapter 4 
patents for acrolein and acrylonitrile catalysts showed, mixed oxides was an 
appropriate description.  
From their experiments on the oxidation of naphthalene and presumably 
other published information, Mars and van Krevelen realized that the reaction 
could be explained by a redox mechanism.74 They suggested that two stages 
were involved:  
• Initially naphthalene vapor reacted with the oxide catalyst to provide 
products while the catalyst was reduced.  
• Reduced catalyst was then reoxidized with molecular oxygen before the 
reaction proceeded further.  
The catalyst used in their experiments to determine the reaction kinetics was 
reported to be similar to the Davison ﬂuid bed phthalic anhydride catalyst, and 
results conﬁrmed that the redox reaction was independent of the hydrocarbon 
pressure.  
Mars and van Krevelen did not describe the form of oxygen taking part in 
the redox procedure. It has since been shown by isotopic labelling experiments 
that the hydrocarbon is oxidized with oxygen from the lattice of the actual cata-
lyst. During the oxidation of propylene to acrolein with oxygen-18 over a typical 
bismuth molybdate catalyst, the acrolein and carbon dioxide initially formed 
contain only oxygen-16. It appears that the bismuth molybdate catalyst can ap-
parently use most of its lattice oxygen before it is completely inactive. Naturally, 
in commercial oxidation, the oxygen vacancies in the lattice are quickly replaced 
by dissociated molecular oxygen. Catalysts usually achieve maximum activity 
when the surface is partly reduced.  
It is clear from subsequent developments since Mars and van Krevelen 
made their initial suggestion, that sites of higher activity are formed by cation 
pairs relative to single cations as in, for example, partially reduced vanadium 
pentoxide, or cupric oxide. At least two oxides are required although neither 
may be active or selective enough alone. One part within the cation pair forms 
the active intermediate that is then oxidized with oxygen ions provided by the 
other part. Mixed oxides can exist as different crystalline phases and it is im-
portant to select the particular structure with the highest catalyst activity for the 
required reaction.  
4.9.  
ACROLEIN AND ACRYLONITRILE  
Acrylonitrile has been an important organic intermediate since the 1930s, when 
it was used in a copolymer for synthetic butadiene rubbers in Germany. While 
Buna-N was not as successful as the similar Buna-S, made with styrene, acrylo-
nitrile is now widely used in the production of ﬁbers, and ABS resins. Early 
production routes were based on the reaction of ethylene oxide or acetylene with

hydrogen cyanide,97 rather than by heterogeneous catalytic. Later, DuPont pro-
duced acrylonitrile on a small scale by oxidizing propylene with nitric oxide 
using a silver oxide/silica catalyst. 
The ﬁrst use of oxide oxidation catalysts for the production of acrolein from 
propylene with a cuprous oxide/silica formulation was described by Shell in 
1948. This followed an Allied Chemical Company patent describing the poten-
tial production of acrylonitrile from propylene. As demand for these products 
increased during the 1950s, other, more efﬁcient, catalysts based on mixed ox-
ides were developed. The best early catalysts are listed in Table 4.13.  
It was soon realized that commercial units would be based on the use of 
ﬂuidized beds, which were then being introduced in reﬁneries to produce gaso-
line. The most successful ﬂuid bed process was introduced by Idol of Sohio in 
1960 and used a bismuth phosphomolybdate catalyst supported on silica.98 
Knapsack described a bismuth phosphomolybdate catalyst containing iron for 
acrylonitrile production in 1962.99 This rather more complex mixed oxide for-
mulation, Fe7Bi2Mo12O52, also supported on silica, foreshadowed improvements 
in the 1970s and the introduction of multicomponent catalysts. Since then sever-
al generations of improved catalysts have been introduced, e.g., by Sohio, as the 
reaction mechanism has been better understood.  
 
4.9.1. Manufacture of Mixed Oxide Catalysts for Acrolein and Acrylonitrile  
 
The original bismuth molybdate catalyst described in the early patents was sup-
ported on silica and prepared by a relatively simple procedure:100  
158 
Chapter 4 
• Aqueous solutions of molybdic acid and bismuth nitrate were added, suc-
cessively, to an aqueous silica sol and the mixture acidiﬁed with nitric ac-
id.  
• The solution was evaporated to dryness and heated to about 5400C for 16 
h. The solid was ground to a ﬁne powder for use as catalyst in a ﬂuid bed 
reactor.  
A more active bismuth phosphomolybdate (Table 4.13) was prepared simp-
ly by adding an appropriate volume of phosphoric acid to the initial solution. A 
typical catalyst composition was claimed to be Bi9PMo12O52−55·2SiO2. The same 
catalysts could be used to produce both acrolein and acrylonitrile.  
During full-scale operation it was found that whiskers of molybdenum ox-
ide could form on the catalyst surface in the presence of steam. This led to cak-
ing of the particles as well as loss of molybdenum. The problem with catalyst 
caking is that the ﬂuid bed ceases to operate correctly and temperature control is 
severely impaired. This results in signiﬁcant loss in selectivity. By ensuring that 
the ratio of bismuth to molybdenum was greater than 2:3 the loss could be con-
trolled. An upper bismuth-tomolybdenum ratio of about 3:4 was ﬁxed101 because 
bismuth was expensive.  
The second generation Sohio catalyst, introduced during the mid-1960s, 
was an antimony oxide/uranium oxide mixture (UO3x2Sb2O3).102 
A successful 
iron oxide/antimony oxide catalyst containing some tellurium oxide was subse-
quently developed by Nitto, a Sohio licensee, in Japan.103  
In 1972, a third generation Sohio catalyst with a number of promoters was 
introduced to limit by-product acetonitrile formation. It had a general formula 
(Ni,Co)8(Fe3+)3BiMo12O60, was also supported on silica, and was made by the 
original recipe. Other promoters were later included in smaller proportions. 
Many other mixed oxide catalysts for the oxidation of propylene to acrolein had 
been investigated since the late 1940s. Apart from the bismuth molybdates, 
other formulations were based on cuprous oxide, antimony and tin oxides, tellu-
rium and tin oxides, and other combinations. The methods of preparation ranged 
from the ball milling of oxides and the silica support to the mixing of metal salts 
and support in an acid solution followed by evaporation to dryness and grinding 
to the required particle size. In most cases conversion increased as the propor-
tion of support increased to about 70–80%, after which the product yield de-
clined. Tellurium is no longer used as a catalyst component because the oxide is 
toxic and disposal of deactivated catalysts is no longer allowed.  
 
4.9.2. The Acrylonitrile Process  
 
The Sohio ﬂuidized bed acrylonitrile process has proved to be extremely suc-
cessful and provides most of the worldwide acrylonitrile demand. During opera-
tion the catalyst temperature is controlled by circulating water through vertical 
tubes within the catalyst bed.  
 
 
 
Oxidation Catalysts  
159 
The catalyst is very hard and almost no attrition losses are experienced. Any 
dust forming is ﬁltered from the quench water. As the inventory declines, 
makeup catalyst can be added or, if activity falls, an appropriate volume can be 
withdrawn and replaced. Molybdenum losses could be replaced during operation 
or the catalyst could be discharged and milled to remove lumps. Whiskers of 
molybdenum oxide grew on the catalyst particles causing either the loss of mo-
lybdenum or caking during the earlier days of operation of the process. This 
problem was solved by optimisation of the bismuth/molybdenum ratio. There do 
not seem to be any serious operating problems and catalyst can be used almost 
continuously for up to 10 years. By-products, such as acetonitrile, and particu-
larly hydrogen cyanide are recovered and used commercially. Typical process 
conditions are shown in Table 4.14.  
 
 
4.9.3. Reaction Mechanism  
 
Catalysts used for the oxidation or ammoxidation of propylene must have an 
appropriate structure to give selective operation. The ﬁrst generation Sohio 
catalysts had active sites that consisted of adjacent bismuth and molybdenum 
atoms in the mixed oxide lattice. 
 
Similar mechanisms were suggested for both reactions in which the initial 
hydrogen abstraction from a propylene molecule adsorbed on a molybdenum 
atom was the rate-determining step.104

Acrolein formation:  
• α-Hydrogen abstraction from propylene by the bismuth atom forms a sur-
face hydroxyl group and an adsorbed allyl intermediate.  
• Reaction of the allyl intermediate with a surface oxygen atom and a se-
cond hydrogen abstraction forms acrolein and leaves a lattice oxygen va-
cancy.  
• Acrolein desorbs.  
• The oxygen vacancies are ﬁlled by the dissociation of adsorbed molecular 
oxygen at the molybdenum atom, which provides mobile oxygen ions to 
restore the active bismuth site.  
• Adjacent hydroxyl groups dehydrate, forming water and once again, re-
storing the active site.  
Acrylonitrile formation:  
• The molybdenum atom is activated by reaction with ammonia, which pro-
duces a molybdenum di-imido species before propylene is adsorbed.  
• α-Hydrogen abstraction from propylene by the bismuth atom then forms 
the allyl intermediate.  
• The allyl intermediate is converted to an organic nitrogen intermediate by 
reaction with the di-imido species and a second hydrogen abstraction to 
leave a lattice oxygen vacancy.  
• Acrylonitrile is produced by a third hydrogen abstraction and desorbs. 
• The oxygen vacancies are ﬁlled by molecular oxygen adsorbed and disso-
ciated at the molybdenum atom to produce mobile oxygen ions.  
• The molybdenum atom is again activated by ammonia.  
The ammoxidation process operates at a higher temperature than that re-
quired for the production of acrolein. This is probably a consequence of the 
different reactivity of ammonia towards the catalyst, and the difference in reac-
tivities between oxide and imido groups. A similar range of operating tempera-
tures was used during early experiments on the catalytic oxidation of ammonia 
to produce nitric oxide for nitric acid manufacture. In this work, however, ni-
trous oxide was the initial product.106  
It is important to have a high concentration of bismuth atoms at the catalyst 
surface, to generate the optimum structure, for forming active sites, –Bi–Mo–
Bi–Mo–. The optimum bismuth/molybdenum ratio for practical operation is in 
the range 2:3 to 3:4, and this is a composition close to α-Bi2O3·3MoO3, 
[Bi2(MoO4)3]. This has a type of defect-Scheelite structure, Bi2/3[]1/3MoO4
107 
and is probably more selective than either β-Bi2O3x2MoO3 or γ-Bi2O3·MoO3, 
which may result as molybdenum oxide is lost from the catalyst structure during 
operation. All catalysts active for acrylonitrile production are mixtures of oxides

that when used alone are either inactive or unselective for the ammoxidation 
reaction.  
The second generation Sohio catalyst was a uranium antimonate 
(USb3O10).108 This was more active and selective than the earlier bismuth phos-
phomolybdate and has been described as Phase 1. Active sites in the layer struc-
ture were also defect-Scheelite structures containing uranium-antimony cation 
pairs. Catalysts containing USbO5, or Phase 2, were less selective.  
Third generation Sohio catalysts were also based on bismuth molybdates 
and contained nickel, cobalt, iron, and minor amounts of other promoters. It has 
been suggested that the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple facilitates the adsorption and 
activation of molecular oxygen at the catalyst surface.  
 
4.9.4. Partial Oxidation of Propane  
 
The selective oxidation of propane is more difﬁcult than that of propylene due to 
its low reactivity and there has been little success in developing a viable process.  
Moro-Oka and his colleagues tested bismuth vanadophosphates doped with 
a number of promoters such as silver.109 A catalyst with the composition 
Bi0.85V0.54Ag0.01Mo0.45O4 gave a conversion of only 13%, but 67% selectivity to 
acrylonitrile at 5000C and 3000 h-1 space velocity using oxygen. While yields 
were reasonable, the conversion was not high enough for a commercial process. 
Although the concentration of propane in feed gas was considerably higher than 
the propylene in the conventional acrylonitrile process, the recycle costs were 
still too high. A propane ammoxidation process patent was granted to Harris,110 
of Davy Process Technology, in 1973 for the use of a vanadium antimonate 
catalyst. BP Amoco have tested the process on a large scale,113 but far detailed 
information on operation has not yet been published. This process was devel-
oped jointly in conjunction with ICI. Excellent selectivities were achieved, but 
in a similar situation to the Moro-Oka work, the process suffered from low con-
versions.  
Since then Centi has also examined catalysts based on vanadium antimo-
nates.111 Conversion as high as 60–80%, but only 35–40% yields, were obtained 
with a VSb5WOx catalyst supported on alumina. Bowker conﬁrmed Centi’s 
conclusion that the reaction proceeds in two steps.112 Propane is ﬁrst dehydro-
genated to propylene, which is then ammoxidized to acrylonitrile by the well-
established reaction mechanism.  
 
4.9.5. Acrylic Acid  
 
Acrylic acid was originally produced by reacting ethylene oxide with hydrogen 
cyanide and later by the carbonylation of acetylene, using a nickel tetracarbonyl 
catalyst promoted with copper halide. It is now generally produced by the oxida-
162 
Chapter 4 
tion of propylene using mixed oxide catalysts in processes that also provide 
acrolein as a useful co-product.  
It is common practice to use two reactors. The first reactor contains a con-
ventional bismuth phosphomolybdate catalyst and is used to convert propylene 
to acrolein. The second reactor contains a selective vanadium molybdate catalyst 
promoted with tungsten, nickel, manganese or copper,114 to convert acrolein to 
acrylic acid. Fixed bed tubular reactors are used in both stages. Typical operat-
ing conditions are shown in Table 4.15.  
 
4.9.6. Oxidation of Isobutene  
 
Isobutene can be oxidized to methacrolein or methacrylonitrile using the same 
catalysts as for propylene oxidation. The reactions are: 
 
 
 
C4H8  +  O2  →  CH2:CH(CH3)CHO  +  ½ H2O 
(4.20) 
 
 
 
C4H8  + 5/4 O2  →  CH2:CH(CH3)CN  +  5/2 H2O 
(4.21) 
 
This process avoids the by-product ammonium sulfate formed from the acetone 
cyanohydrin route.  
4.10. OXIDATIVE DEHYDROGENATION OF n-BUTENES TO 
BUTADIENE  
The oxidative dehydrogenation of normal butenes in the presence of steam can 
produce a higher conversion to butadiene than typical dehydrogenation process-
es.115 Added oxygen not only converts the hydrogen being formed to water but 
also prevents carbon formation, so that catalyst regeneration is not required. 
Petrotex introduced the Oxo-D process in 1965. It operates at a temperature in 
the range 575–6000C with a steam ratio of up to 12 to control selectivity.

About 65% butene conversion is achieved at more than 95% selectivity.116 Phil-
lips also developed the O-X-D process, which operated under similar conditions. 
Both processes use ﬁxed beds of catalyst. Oxidative dehydrogenation with metal 
oxide catalysts involves a redox mechanism and the catalyst used should not be 
reduced irreversibly during the cycle.  
In early patents, it was claimed that various phosphate catalysts, including 
calcium/nickel phosphate and bismuth/molybdate, were active. A variety of 
other catalysts was also introduced, including the zinc and magnesium ferrites 
developed by Petrotex.117 The best ferrite catalyst included chromium to prevent 
excessive catalyst reduction.118 Phillips described tin oxide catalysts that were 
promoted with 4% phosphate and 1% lithium as well as the bismuth/phosphate 
catalysts that were promoted with boron or lithium compounds.  
Several units using these processes were built during the late 1960s but 
closed down before 1980 when butadiene became available as a byproduct from 
the steam cracking of hydrocarbons.

CATALYTIC CRACKING 
CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
5.1.  
INTRODUCTION  
Catalytic cracking is one of the most important processes in a modern refinery. 
It is the most economic way to convert low-value crude oil fractions into more 
valuable products and it has been described not only as the heart of the refinery 
but also as the garbage can!1 Although the process was originally developed as a 
gasoline producer it also supplies large volumes of gaseous hydrocarbons that 
are used in alkylation plants and as petrochemical feedstock. Furthermore, do-
mestic fuel oil is an important by-product.  
The complexity of catalytic cracking units and the number of catalysts used 
has signiﬁcantly increased in the 60 years since the ﬁrst practical process was 
introduced by Eugene Houdry in 1936. Not only did the original ﬁxed catalyst 
beds give way to moving beds but, more signiﬁcantly, the development of 
ﬂuidized beds and active zeolite catalysts led to greatly improved process de-
signs with higher production capacity.  
The first feed to be used in catalytic cracking units was virgin gas oil. How-
ever, from the 1970s on, cheaper residual fractions are also used as the cost of 
crude oil increased. Demand for higher octane ratings, particularly as lead-free 
gasoline was introduced, led to improvements in catalyst formulation. Later, 
when residual fractions were added to catalytic cracker feeds, more active cata-
lyst matrices were needed together with additives to absorb poisons and control 
sulfur emissions.

5.2. PROCESS DEVELOPMENT  
The Houdry catalytic cracking process began semicommercial operation at the 
Sun Oil Company, Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, refinery in 1936 with a capacity 
of 2000 barrels per day (bpd). The ﬁrst large-scale unit soon followed at the 
same location in 1937 with a capacity of 15,000 bpd of heavy gas oil.  
5.2.1.  Fixed Beds  
The main problem with this process is that the catalyst rapidly becomes deacti-
vated due to the deposition of coke, and therefore it needs to be regenerated in a 
separate stage. To achieve continuous operation, three fixed-bed, tube-cooled 
reactors each containing a clay catalyst were used. One reactor was operated for 
up to 10 min until the catalyst was deactivated by coke.  At the same time the 
deactivated catalyst in the second reactor was regenerated with air.  The catalyst 
in the third reactor had already been regenerated and so it was ready for further 
use.  The cycle time was typically 15 min, depending primarily on the rate of 
carbon deposition. The cracking reaction is endothermic and requires an input of 
heat. The catalyst bed was heated to about 4500C by passing a molten eutectic 
mixture of sodium nitrite and potassium nitrate through the cooling tubes. The 
oxidative regenerative procedure is highly exothermic and the catalyst bed needs 
to be cooled to about 5000C before use. This was achieved by passing the same, 
cooled eutectic mixture through the cooling tubes of the catalyst bed. Thus, the 
heat generated during the regeneration procedure was used to supply the heat 
required for the cracking reaction. The original clay catalysts had a life of up to 
18 months before they were permanently deactivated and replaced.  
Houdry catalytic cracking units (Figure 5.1) produced better-quality gaso-
line of higher octane rating, with fewer unsaturated compounds, than thermal 
cracking units. They were an immediate success and made an important contri-
bution to the high-octane aviation gasoline requirements during World War II. 
By 1944 US capacity had grown to 24 units processing 330,000 bpd of feed. A 
synthetic silica/alumina catalyst was developed by Houdry and first used in July 
1940. The new catalyst was superior to clays because it had a uniform chemical 
composition and formed less coke. Although marginally less gasoline was pro-
duced at a given conversion, it was of better quality with a higher octane rating.  
The fixed bed design was soon replaced by more convenient processes with 
continuous circulation of the catalyst from the reactor to the regenerator and 
then back to the reactor. The new crackers had the advantage of using smaller 
vessels with less heat loss. They were also more flexible to operate because the 
catalyst itself acted as the heat transfer medium.

crease production. The second and third FCC units (Figure 5.2) which started at 
Baton Rouge in June 1942 with a capacity of 17,000 bpd, were still in operation 
more than 50 years later with a combined up-rated capacity of 188,000 bpd.2  
During production the vaporized, high-boiling feed is cracked in the fluid-
ized bed of catalyst to produce a mixture of lighter hydrocarbons. The catalyst is 
quickly deactivated by the deposition of coke. The catalyst is then separated 
from products in a stripping section and transferred to a regenerator, where coke 
is burned in a stream of air. The regenerated catalyst then leaves the regenerator, 
is mixed with fresh feed and recirculated. Modern plants operate with riser-only-
cracking and reaction takes place in the original transfer line between the regen-
erator and the old reactor. The original reactor serves only as a disengager to 
separate the catalyst from the products. This allows more efficient operation 
with the active zeolite catalyst and minimizes the catalyst volume, or inventory, 
needed in modern FCC units.  
Any catalyst dust formed by attrition and lost in the cyclones has to be re-
placed at regular intervals. It is also necessary to replace a small proportion of 
the circulating equilibrium catalyst to compensate for gradual permanent deacti-
vation and maintain conversion. About 3% of fresh catalyst is added to a unit on 
a daily basis to maintain the necessary catalyst inventory. The whole operation 
is continuous and a unit may be operated for several years without shut down. 
An important feature of the process is that heat transferred from the regenerator 
to the reactor by the hot catalyst as a heat transfer agent is an integral part of the 
energy balance.  
The clay-based catalysts used in the early cracking units were of low activi-
ty and of poor thermal and structural stability. High recycle rates of uncracked 
feed and the severe coke deposition at low-space-velocity operation limited out-
put. Regeneration temperatures were limited to below 6000C not only because of 
metallurgical restrictions but also to avoid catalyst deactivation. This meant that 
the volume of regeneration air was restricted and regenerated catalyst still con-
tained 0.6% coke. The ﬂue gas was a mixture of carbon dioxide with some car-
bon monoxide because of incomplete carbon combustion. When catalyst fluidi-
zation in the regenerator was not uniform, after-burn was a regular problem as 
carbon monoxide reacted with oxygen, causing possible ignition and leading to 
excessive temperatures. To minimize catalyst damage during these temperature 
runaways, coolers and water sprays needed to be installed. Catalyst coolers were 
used to control the regenerator temperature, and this allowed additional air to be 
passed into the regenerator which, in turn, resulted in lower levels of residual 
coke in the regenerated catalyst. Lower levels of carbon in the catalyst led to 
higher conversions in the reactor, the use of increased feed rates and hence 
greater production capacity. Figure 5.3 shows an Orthoflow Resid FCC convert-
er.

5.2.3. Catalyst Regeneration and Carbon Monoxide Combustion  
 
5.2.3.1.  Catalyst Regeneration  
 
Catalyst regeneration is an important part of the FCC process. It removes coke 
from deactivated catalyst and provides heat to maintain operation. As catalyst 
circulates through the regenerator, coke burns in air and the catalyst is regener-
ated for further use. Hot regenerated catalyst carries the heat around the unit to 
vaporize feed and maintain temperature in the riser during the endothermic 
cracking reaction. Heat from the regenerator is also used in other ways. Steam is 
generated to strip hydrocarbons from catalyst returning to the regenerator and 
heat recovered from ﬂue gas is used to preheat combustion air.  
About 70% of the combustion heat is absorbed by the catalyst during regen-
eration, with the remainder leaving the regenerator in flue gas or as heat loss. 
The endothermic cracking reaction absorbs 10–25% of the heat circulated by the 
catalyst while a further 70–80% is needed to heat the feed to the reaction tem-
176  
Chapter 5 
perature. About 5% of the heat is lost or recovered for other purposes. The heat 
balance in the FCC unit is critical to the economy of its operation.  
Typical coke is a mixture of high molecular weight, hydrogen-deficient hy-
drocarbons, containing about 6–7% hydrogen. Any variation in the hydrogen 
content affects the heat of combustion and the heat balance. The ratio of “regen-
eration air” to the amount of hydrocarbon/coke on the spent catalyst controls the 
combustion reaction and this influences both the final temperature and the ratio 
of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. When the stripping 
stage is inefficient and more hydrocarbon passes with the catalyst into the re-
generator bed, the temperature rises and the flue gas composition changes.  
Early FCC units were made with carbon steel internals and unstable cata-
lysts, which restricted the regenerator temperature to less than 6000C and left a 
substantial volume of carbon monoxide in flue gas. This was not only toxic but 
led to operating difficulties. After-burning occurred when air did not mix 
properly with the catalyst, leading to hot spots in the regenerator. It was then 
necessary to install steam injectors to control bed temperature and “boilers” in 
the ﬂue gas line to burn residual carbon monoxide. Two-stage regenerators were 
also designed to avoid catalyst damage. More stable catalysts allowed an in-
crease of regeneration temperature to 6500C. Finally, when stainless steel inter-
nals were introduced, regenerator temperature were increased to about 7500C. 
This allowed the addition of more air which resulted in almost complete com-
bustion.  
 
5.2.3.2. Carbon Monoxide Combustion Promoter 
 
Early attempts by Mobil to minimize after-burning in TCC units led to the addi-
tion of chromium oxide to their Durabead catalyst to oxidize carbon monoxide, 
but this unfortunately also decreased cracking selectivity. Mobil then introduced 
a platinum/alumina additive in 1976 to control carbon monoxide combustion in 
the regenerator.3 
Platinum was added either as a component of the cracking cata-
lyst or in separate particles. Complete combustion of carbon monoxide was 
achieved by adding the equivalent of 0.5 ppm of platinum to the catalyst inven-
tory.  
The use of platinum additives provides efficient heat transfer in the dense 
phase and controls temperature runaways in the dilute phase, even when excess 
oxygen is used. Either complete or partial carbon monoxide combustion is now 
possible, depending on the unit requirements, simply by controlling the air rate 
to the regenerator and using the additive. Improved regenerator operation at 
higher temperatures gives less residual coke on regenerated catalyst, which im-
proves activity in the riser. Improved heat transfer in the regenerator with fewer 
hot spots lessens hydrothermal catalyst deactivation.

5.2.4.  Equilibrium Catalyst  
 
During operation of an FCC unit several factors influence catalyst performance. 
Catalyst activity declines rapidly. This is mainly the temporary effect of coke 
formation and this activity loss can be restored by regeneration. Permanent deac-
tivation also takes place as thermal and hydrothermal sintering of the zeolite 
leads to dealumination of the crystal structure. Metal impurities in the feed also 
affect performance and deactivate the zeolite. Although the zeolite deactivates 
quickly the catalyst matrix generally retains its activity for longer periods. The 
physical movement of fluidized catalyst between the reactor and the regenerator 
causes loss of the catalyst by attrition to dust, which leaves the system through a 
series of cyclones.  
To compensate for deactivation and poisoning the low-activity catalyst is 
regularly withdrawn from the circulating inventory, which is replaced with fresh 
catalyst. Replacement is usually about 1–3% of the total inventory every day. 
This is very substantial. A replacement rate of 3% a day, an FCC unit with an 
inventory of 200 tons of catalyst, more than 2000 tons of catalyst are replaced 
every year. The replacement rate is based on the need to maintain a constant 
operating activity. The catalyst inventory has a significant age distribution. Gen-
erally, about half of the total catalyst is less than 3 weeks old and accounts for 
more than 70% of the total activity.  
FCC units operate continuously and are hardly ever closed down to change 
the catalyst inventory completely because of the lost production this would in-
volve. When it is necessary to use a different catalyst type, it would take a long 
time to remove the old catalyst at the small makeup rate needed to maintain ac-
tivity and to replace physical losses. At 3% replacement per day it takes eight 
weeks to change 80% of the inventory. However, because the freshest catalyst 
contributes most to conversion and overall yield, almost the full effects of a 
catalyst change are noticeable after 50–60% replacement. Catalyst producers 
provide information that enables operators to estimate the time taken for chang-
ing catalysts to take effect.4  
It is usual to check the properties of equilibrium catalyst (E Cat) to maintain 
the replacement rate at the optimum level and to review any potential process 
problems.5 The following tests are typical:  
• Micro-activity tests (MAT) are used to measure activity at a constant lev-
el and determine the appropriate catalyst makeup rate.  
• Catalyst surface area measurements of the zeolite and matrix components 
help to analyze deactivation mechanisms and provide a rapid assessment 
of activity.  
• Chemical analyses of known catalyst poisons, such as vanadium, sodium, 
and nickel, also allow control of catalyst makeup rates to maintain activity.
178  
Chapter 5 
• Equilibrium catalyst attrition index and average particle size distribution 
(APS) indicate changes in the rate of catalyst attrition. Further analysis of 
APS for any catalyst that is carried forward into the fractionator, present 
in the slurry, or which leaves the unit via the regenerator stack can identi-
fy problems associated with catalyst quality or cyclone operation. Prob-
lems include operation at greater than design feed, catalyst rates or cy-
clone maloperation. APS is also important in predicting the fluidization 
properties of the catalyst inventory.  
As well as the need for routine analyses of equilibrium catalyst, regular 
checks on all batches of fresh catalyst are carried out to check the consistency of 
particle size, the attrition index, and the activity of the catalyst added to a unit. 
Excess steam deactivates the catalyst and causes abnormal attrition. High air 
velocity or maldistribution of air in the regenerator increases catalyst attrition 
and leads to variations in the carbon content of the equilibrium catalyst.  
Troubleshooting is extremely important in maintaining optimum operation 
of FCC units. The correlation of trends in equilibrium catalyst properties with 
operating data can quickly identify potential problems. These can often be con-
firmed by a number of useful nondestructive tests. For example, radioisotope 
tracer experiments can measure vapor velocities and catalyst flow patterns 
throughout the unit.6 It is possible to show catalyst distribution within the riser, 
the regenerator, and the cyclones as well as the stripper. Cracks in internal cy-
clones or blockages in the stripper can been quickly identified. Not surprisingly, 
maldistribution of catalyst and vapor has often been confirmed in risers and re-
generators.  
 
5.2.5.  Reaction Mechanism of Catalytic Cracking Reactions  
 
Catalytic cracking proceeds via a carbenium ion mechanism that provides a 
higher yield of more useful products than thermal cracking reactions. These 
products include more hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling range, with high 
proportions of branched paraffins, olefins and aromatics to increase octane 
numbers. Carbenium ions can form in a number of ways, but the main initiation 
processes are acid catalyzed by both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. This in-
volves either the removal of a hydride ion from a saturated hydrocarbon (Lewis 
site) or the addition of a proton to an oleﬁn or aromatic nucleus (Brønsted site). 
It has also been suggested that at high temperatures the addition of a proton to a 
parafﬁn can form a pentacoordinated carboniun ion, which undergoes β-scission 
or loses hydrogen to form a carbenium ion. Carbenium ions are extremely reac-
tive and have short lifetimes but take part in all of the catalytic cracking reac-
tions.  
The typical feeds to catalytic cracking units shown in Table 5.2 are mixtures 
of parafﬁns, naphthenes, alkyl chain substituted aromatics, and more complicat-
ed molecules.  These undergo the series of complex cracking reactions, includ-

5.3. CATALYST DEVELOPMENT  
As soon as the automobile industry became established, it was recognized that 
straight-run gasoline available from refineries could not satisfy potential de-
mand. Statistics shows that by the 1920’s, the demand from an increasing num-
ber of automobiles could only be met by the use of thermal cracking processes.7 
Attempts were soon started to develop more efﬁcient and economic catalytic 
cracking processes. Sabatier had tested various metal oxides as catalysts to crack 
petroleum fractions; subsequently several patents were issued in Germany for 
processes based on clay catalysts, which were not successful. The McAfee pro-
cess, which was developed by Gulf and operated from about 1915, used an alu-
minum chloride cracking catalyst. Despite petroleum yields of 35–48%, the pro-
cess was uneconomic by 1929 and not widely used, mainly because the catalyst 
could not be recycled and more efficient thermal cracking processes had been 
developed.8  
The major problem in developing a reliable catalytic process for cracking 
gas oils was the rapid deactivation of catalysts by coke deposition. It was not 
until Eugene Houdry began his work around 1927 that there was any signiﬁcant 
progress. Houdry showed that cracked gasoline was better than thermal gasoline, 
and he was able to remove the carbonaceous residues from his catalyst by re-
generation in a stream of air. More significantly, however, he demonstrated that 
certain clays were both active and economic catalysts because they retained ac-
tivity during regeneration.  
After large-scale pilot plant testing, in cooperation with the Vacuum Oil 
Company from 1931 to 1933 and Sun Oil from 1933 to 1937, the first full-scale 
catalytic cracking unit began operation in 1937.  
The first clays selected for testing by Houdry were the acid treated materials 
originally used as adsorbents to purify lubricating oils. The most active clay was 
supplied by the Pechelbron Oil Reﬁning Company of San Diego. Bentonite 
clays were being tested by 1933 and the Filtrol Company supplied catalyst pel-
lets for the ﬁrst large-scale unit in 1937. It is signiﬁcant that synthetic sili-
ca/alumina compositions, similar to the natural products but of different chemi-
cal structures, have continued to be the most successful catalysts, although the 
chemical and physical properties have been considerably developed. Clay cata-
lysts gave variable performance, which was improved by the use of synthetic 
silica/alumina powders in Houdry plants from about 1940. These catalysts con-
tained no metal impurities and produced better-quality gasoline with increased 
octane numbers, and more light gas and less coke were produced. While the 
fluid bed catalyst used by Standard Oil in its development work was based on 
acid-treated clays, a more suitable silica/alumina catalyst was developed by Da-
vison for the full-scale plant.  
Further improvements continued and spray-dried microspheroidal particles 
of silica/alumina were introduced in 1948. These gave better activity and selec-

tivity, together with more stable performance. Also, the more regular shape im-
proved fluidization properties and decreased attrition losses. A strong, active 
high-alumina content silica/alumina catalyst was introduced in 1955. This was 
more active and stable than earlier catalysts with the same composition and pro-
vided more resistance to the poisoning effects of metal impurities present in 
feed.  
 
5.3.1. Natural Clay Catalysts  
 
The cracking catalysts used in the Houdry ﬁxed bed process were based on the 
commercially available clays used in pilot plant tests. Acid-treated bentonites 
were found to have an acceptable activity and could be easily regenerated. Ben-
tonite clays are formed from volcanic ash and contain up to 90% of the mineral 
montmorillonite. Montmorillonite has a three-sheet lattice structure consisting of 
a central layer of alumina octahedra sandwiched between two layers of silica 
tetrahedra. About one in six aluminum atoms is substituted isomorphously with 
a magnesium atom. All metal atoms are linked, within and between the layers by 
oxygen atoms. Some oxygen atoms in each of the alumina octahedra also form 
hydroxyl groups.  
This structure has a negative lattice charge for every magnesium atom that 
has replaced an aluminum atom, and the mineral has base exchange properties. 
Iron also replaces some of the aluminum atoms in the lattice.  
When the bentonite clays are treated with acids, up to 80% of the aluminum 
can be extracted from the montmorillonite lattice together with most of the mag-
nesium and iron. No silica is dissolved during the extraction process, but it is 
probable that some may be peptized to form an active amorphous phase with 
alumina. This increases the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst. Typical 
analyses of commercial catalysts shown in Table 5.4 indicate that sulfuric acid 
was a common activating agent.9 
Impurities affect the performance of cracking catalysts. For example, when 
iron atoms are sulﬁded they are displaced from the montmorillonite lattice. Iron 
sulﬁde is oxidized during regeneration and subsequently catalyses the dehydro-
genation of hydrocarbons in the reactor to form gas and coke. Bentonite from 
some particular locations could not be used as catalysts because of high iron 
content.  
Activated kaolinite and halloysite/endellite clays were also used as cracking 
catalysts. The double-layer lattice of kaolinite consists of alternating tetrahedral 
silica and octahedral alumina layers and the halloysite/endellite structures have 
interlamellar water layers. There is very little cation exchange with natural clays 
of this type but after heating at 6000C to dehydrate and destroy the lattice, alu-
mina can be extracted with acid to give catalysts comparable to activated mont- 
morillonite. Kaolin-based cracking catalysts were therefore used to replace 
montmorillonite types, mainly because they did not suffer from the deactivating

further calcination, is even more important because it can be converted to Y-
zeolite for in situ catalysts.10 
 
 
5.3.2. Synthetic Silica Alumina Catalysts  
 
The composition of acid-treated natural clay catalysts was more or less duplicat-
ed in the synthetic catalyst formulations. The main advantage of synthetic cata-
lysts was a reproducible composition with few impurities known to cause deac-
tivation. Both silica/alumina and silica/magnesia formulations were used in early 
tests but, despite good activity, silica/magnesia catalysts were unstable and 
difﬁcult to regenerate.  
The first fluid bed unit used a newly developed synthetic silica/alumina cat-
alyst supplied by Davison (Figure 5.4) and performed more reliably than clay 
catalysts under the demanding operating conditions.11 Although synthetic cata-
lysts gave only a marginal improvement in conversion and selectivity, they were 
more stable and resistant to attrition than clays in ﬂuid bed operation. Properties 
of silica/alumina catalysts are shown in Table 5.4.  
 
5.3.3. Preparation of Synthetic Catalysts  
 
Silica/alumina catalysts were carefully prepared by precipitating alumina from 
an aluminum salt at pH 7 onto a freshly prepared silica hydrogel. The precipitate

had to be carefully washed before being spray dried. It has been reported that 
about 15,000 gal (US) of water were required to produce 1 ton of finished cata-
lyst.  
Early silica/alumina catalysts contained 10–13% Al2O3, which, at the time, 
appeared to be optimum. Increased alumina content had little effect on activity 
and produced gasoline with a lower octane number, while forming more coke. 
Powdered silica/alumina catalysts were used until spray-dried microspheroidal 
particles were introduced in 1948.  
Eventually, by improving the dispersion of alumina within the silica, in-
creased activity was achieved with 25% alumina in the ﬁnished catalyst.12 
This 
formulation, with a larger pore volume, gave the same product distribution and 
coke yield but was stronger and more stable. High-alumina catalysts also pro-
vided better resistance to metals poisoning. It is interesting that a semisynthetic 
spray-dried silica/alumina catalyst containing a kaolin clay was also produced. 
Semisynthetics, which were stronger and more poison resistant than sili-
ca/aluminas, were the forerunners of the matrix used in zeolite catalysts.  
5.4.  
ZEOLITE CATALYSTS  
The new TCC catalysts containing zeolite introduced by Mobil in 1962 resulted 
in an immediate increase in the gasoline yield. Compared with amorphous sili-
ca/alumina catalysts, zeolites were much more active and formed less coke. The 
new high-activity catalysts were used in FCC units during 1964. Improved per-
formance and high activity indicated significant potential for improvements in 
plant design and efficiency. The activity of pure zeolite was so high that only 
about 10% could be incorporated with a matrix in the new catalyst for use in 
existing units.13  
Despite the dilution, high-activity zeolite catalysts achieved almost 100% 
riser cracking compared with only 15–20% with silica/alumina catalysts. This 
made it possible to redesign FCC units with full riser cracking and so avoid the 
usual overcracking in the dense phase of the reactor. Increased conversion and 
higher throughput led to a reduction in the volume of heavy cycle oil produced 
and recycle rates could be decreased. Thus, production capacity was further in-
creased with little capital expenditure.  
The driving force behind the development of zeolite catalysts by Mobil was 
said to be the additional potential proﬁt of $1 million a year from the production 
of 1% extra gasoline. In fact, by 1968, it was estimated that refineries in the 
United States were saving $1 million a day through the use of zeolites and that 
the total capital savings, by expanding production from older plants and delay-
ing capital expenditure, was $300 million!14 These remarkable statistics showed 
not only how important zeolite catalysts would be to the refining industry, but 
also emphasized the large scale of gasoline production by the FCC process.

5.4.1.  Commercial Zeolites  
 
Zeolites are crystalline silica/aluminas with a high surface area resulting from a 
regular pore structure of cavities connected by channels. Synthetic X-and Y-
zeolites, which were first developed by Union Carbide and resemble naturally 
occurring faujasite, both have the same well-defined three-dimensional system 
of cavities and channels, despite having a different silicon/aluminum ratio.15 The 
channels are large enough to allow most molecules in typical vacuum gas oils, 
such as isoparafﬁns, naphthenes, and aromatics, easy access. Both Y-zeolite and 
X-zeolite, which is cheaper to produce, were used in early cracking catalysts. 
However, only Y-zeolite is used in modern catalysts because it is more stable 
under reaction conditions.  
The zeolite framework consists of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra. These are 
joined, through bridging oxygen atoms, to give hollow, truncated octahedra 
known as sodalite cages, with alternating six-and four-sided faces formed from 
rings of tetrahedra. Sodalite cages are connected at four of the eight six-sided 
faces to form smaller hexagonal prisms. Within the resulting three-dimensional 
framework of tetrahedra, channels connect large cavities, which are known as 
supercages. Each supercage is surrounded by ten sodalite cages connected by

Chapter 5 
Sodium Y-zeolite forms cubic crystals, with each unit cell containing eight 
sodalite cages. The unit cell contains 192 silicon and aluminum atoms. The min-
imum silica/alumina ratio for fresh Y-zeolite is at least 3 (equivalent to 48 alu-
minum atoms in the unit cell). However, it can be much higher due to the loss of 
aluminum atoms or dealumination during preparation or regeneration. The bond 
length of the Al-O bond is 0.171 nm while that of the Si-O bond is only 0.164 
nm. Thus, any increase in the silica/alumina ratio results in a shrinkage of the 
unit cell, as shown in Table 5.5. This can be calculated from X-ray diffraction 
measurements. The unit cell size (UCS) for sodium Y-zeolite with a sili-
ca/alumina ratio of 5 (32 aluminum atoms) is 2.46 nm, whereas if it could be 
completely dealuminated the unit cell would shrink to 2.42 nm. Exchange with 
rare earth ions, which will be explained later, has the effect of stretching the unit 
cell size at any silica/alumina ratio.  
Each supercage in Y-zeolite has four circular openings, or ports, each 0.74 
nm wide, which allow suitable size molecules, such as those shown in Table 5.6, 
to enter the supercage, which is 1.3 nm in diameter. The sodalite cages are too 
small to take part in the cracking reactions, but during exchange reactions they 
can accept rare earth ions, which thus affect the zeolite properties. Acid site den-
sity and the total acidity of the zeolite, which can be equivalent to that of a 
strong acid, is proportional to the number of negatively charged aluminum at-
oms in the framework. The strength of individual sites does, however, decrease 
with increasing site density. The silica/alumina ratio and the distribution of alu-
minum atoms in the sodalite cages can, therefore, affect catalyst performance. 
Lowenstein’s rules, which are summarized in Table 5.7, states that no two adja-
cent tetrahedral sites can be occupied by aluminum atoms but otherwise distri-
bution is random.  
Each zeolite type has a typical silica/alumina ratio related to the crystal 
structure. It is possible, to increase the silica/alumina ratio however, by remov-
ing aluminum atoms from the Y-zeolite framework, with no effect on crystallini-
ty. This, of course, modifies catalyst performance by changing the nature and

available commercially.  
Pentasil zeolites, such as ZSM-5, are often used with octane catalysts. They 
are different from Y-zeolite because the SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra form ﬁve-
membered rings. The rings are linked in the framework to form two types of 
channels. Straight, elliptical channels, 0.51 × 0.58 nm, run parallel to the axis of 
the unit cell, and sinusoidal channels, 0.54 × 0.56 nm, connect at right angles to 
the straight channels. Strong acid sites are located where channels intersect and 
the diameter of the cavity formed is 0.9 nm. The silica/alumina ratio of ZSM-5 
is variable in the range 10–1000, depending on the synthesis and subsequent 
treatment. ZSM-5 is commercially available with silica/alumina ratios in the 
range 30–300.  
 
 
 
 
TABLE 5.7 Lowenstein’s Rules and Y-Zeolite Acidity. 
Crystalline Y-zeolite is formed from framework silicon and aluminum atoms in tetrahedral coordina-
tion with oxygen atoms and linked to other tetrahedra. Certain rules apply: 
• Each aluminum atom has four silicon atoms as nearest neighbors (NN). 
• None of the aluminum atoms is linked directly.  
• The four silicon nearest neighbors are connected to a total of nine other silicon or aluminum 
next nearest neighbors (NNN), which are limited in number by the way sodalite and hexag-
onal cages are linked around the supercage in the unit cell.  
• There are 192 silicon or aluminum atoms in each unit cell. For a typical silicon-aluminum 
ratio of 5 there are about 55 aluminum exchange sites.  
• After sodium exchange (~70% Na+ 
in sodalite and ~30% Na+ 
in hexagonal cages) with pro-
tons, which form hydroxyl Brønsted acid sites, the aluminum atoms become acid sites.  
Aluminum atom sites with no next nearest neighbors have less electronic interaction with other sites 
and more acidity—maximum acidity of individual sites is reached with about 9–12 aluminum atoms 
in the unit cell.

5.4.2.  Production of Zeolites  
 
Most zeolites are synthesized from proportional mixtures of sodium aluminate 
and sodium silicate and, in some cases, colloidal silica. The procedure is differ-
ent to that for the preparation of silica alumina catalysts because zeolites form 
under alkaline conditions as the silica/alumina co-gel crystallizes in the presence 
of hydroxyl ions. The zeolite type formed depends on the proportion of silicate 
and aluminate in the solution and the reaction temperature and pressure. The 
time taken for zeolite crystals to form can range from a few hours to several 
days. Seeds or templates are often added to induce formation of the appropriate 
crystalline product. Knowhow is very important, and precise details for a specif-
ic preparation are not always published.  
Y-zeolite is relatively easy to produce requiring only the addition of finely 
divided silica to seed the crystallization of the saturated solution. The method 
originally used by Filtrol, the company that supplied the ﬁrst catalysts to Hou-
dry, was to produce pure Y-zeolite by the conversion of kaolin clay. The ﬁrst 
step was to form metakaolin by dehydrating the kaolin above 6000C. The dehy-
drated kaolin then contained activated alumina that could be extracted with acid 
to give the appropriate silica/alumina ratio. Following extraction the clay was 
aged in caustic soda solution until pure Y-zeolite crystals formed.16 The success 
of the procedure depended on the use of pure kaolin and careful temperature 
control.  
An improved synthesis of Y zeolite within a matrix of kaolin was intro-
duced by Engelhard. Kaolin was calcined to about 10000C to produce a sili-
ca/alumina spinel, but without forming mullite. The spinel contained less active 
alumina that meta-kaolin. The spinel mixture was then slurried with kaolin and 
seed particles before being spray-dried to form micro-spheres. These are then 
initially aged for some time in caustic solution and then heated to 800C during 
which time the Y-zeolite crystallizes. The supernatant liquid from the crystalli-
zation stage still contains sodium silicate, and the strength of the kaolin matrix

can be increased if the wet micro-spheres are ﬂash dried. The matrix is thermally 
stable, has large pores and is strong enough to be used without binders.  
ZSM-5 is produced by reacting a solution/suspension of silica in N-
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, with aqueous sodium aluminate solution to 
form a gel. The gel is then heated in an autoclave at 1500C for 5 to 8 days during 
which time, the zeolite crystallizes. After being filtered, washed, and dried, the 
crystals are calcined to decompose the organic cation. The zeolite can be ion 
exchanged to give H-ZSM5.17 The silica/alumina ratio varies depending on the 
template used and the reaction conditions selected.  
 
5.4.3. Formation of Active Sites by Ion Exchange  
 
Freshly synthesized X-and Y-zeolites contain up to 13% sodium oxide, with 
about 60–70% in supercages, with the balance in the sodalite cages and hexago-
nal prisms. As prepared, both zeolites have only a limited catalytic activity and 
produce gasoline typical of those produced by thermal cracking. Acid sites can, 
however, be easily generated by ion exchange. Bronsted acids destroy the zeo-
lite framework and it is necessary to exchange sodium with ammonium ions. 
The ammonium zeolite can then be converted to the hydrogen zeolite by a ther-
mal treatment. Normally with two ammonium exchanges the sodium content of 
fresh zeolite can be reduced to less than 2% sodium oxide. Both HX and HY 
zeolites provide FCC catalysts with higher cracking activity than silica/alumina, 
but are unstable and rapidly lose activity as the residual sodium poison migrates 
from the framework to the supercages.  
Removal of sodium from the early Y-zeolites remained an urgent priority 
for catalyst manufacturers who were attempting to increase gasoline yield and 
obtain catalysts with higher thermal stability. Experimental work with Y-zeolite 
had confirmed the benefits of a catalyst with low residual sodium content, but 
repeated exchange with ammonium salts was too expensive to be used commer-
cially. Consequently the Y-zeolite produced commercially was not sufficiently 
stable.  
Early development work by Mobil had shown that the exchange of sodium 
with higher-valency ions, particularly those derived from rare earth metals, in-
creased stability. Rare earth–exchanged NaY-zeolite (REY-zeolite) was not as 
easily dealuminated by steam and high temperatures in the regenerator as HY-
zeolite. Consequently, catalysts manufactured from REY-zeolite were soon be-
ing used to maximize gasoline production in most FCC units.  
Initial exchange with rare earth and ammonium chloride removes sodium 
ions from the supercages. On calcinations, the rare earth oxides and hydroxides 
decompose and migrate into the sodalite cages, where they can exchange for 
more sodium ions. During calcination some of the rare earth ions are converted 
to cationic polynuclear hydroxy complexes that provide additional acid sites.18 
Residual sodium ions in the supercages can then be exchanged with ammonium 
190

chloride and calcined to decompose the ammonium ions. The quantity of rare 
earth that can be introduced depends on the extent to which the Y-zeolite has 
been dealuminated and thus the remaining number of aluminum atoms remain-
ing in the unit cell. A fully exchanged REY-zeolite contains up to about 18% of 
rare earth oxides.  
REY-zeolite catalysts produce higher yields of gasoline than the early sili-
ca/ alumina catalysts although the octane level is lower. This is due to increased 
hydrogen transfer between naphthenes and oleﬁns which produces a mixture of 
aromatics and paraffins. The low-octane parafﬁns are not compensated by the 
high-octane aromatics and the motor octane number (MON) is quite low while 
the research octane number (RON) is not greatly affected. This was not signifi-
cant until lead-free gasoline was introduced, and up until then REY-zeolite cata-
lysts were a great success.  
 
5.4.4. Use of Zeolites in Catalytic Cracking  
 
The use of cracking catalysts containing zeolite increased rapidly following their 
introduction in 1962, and by 1972 they were being used in at least 90% of the 
FCC units in the United States.19 Gasoline production was increased, with a low-
er role of recycle of the residual heavy oil. Gas oil feed rate could, therefore, be 
increased. Zeolites were produced with more consistent quality and were rela-
tively more stable, producing less coke during operation than synthetic sili-
ca/alumina catalysts.  
Some early zeolite catalysts contained X-zeolite, probably because it was 
cheaper to manufacture, but experience soon showed that Y-zeolite was more

stable under typical operating conditions. The most stable and successful cata-
lysts in producing high yields of gasoline were made from REY-zeolite and the-
se became the standard in refineries.  
Most existing units were unable to make full advantage of the higher activi-
ty of pure zeolite catalysts, and the initial catalysts consisted of 5–10% zeolite, 
supported within a matrix. This led to the use of many different formulations so 
that individual operators could make the best use of available equipment. From 
the 1970s, when legislation required that lead additives were phased out of gaso-
line and residual fractions were cracked together with gas oil, an even wider 
range of catalysts became available. Typical examples are described in Table 
5.9.  
 
5.4.5.  The Catalyst Matrix  
 
The matrix has a most important role in FCC catalysts and must be carefully 
formulated depending on the feed being treated. Early catalysts needed a matrix 
because undiluted zeolite was too active for use in existing units and was imme-
diately deactivated as coke deposited on the surface. Zeolites would never have 
been used without a matrix. In 1964 the matrix was simply a diluent and binder 
to form porous particles strong enough to resist attrition while circulating con-
tinuously between the reactor and the regenerator. The hot matrix also acted as a 
heat sink that both circulated heat and effected vaporization of the feed to sus-
tain the endothermic reaction.20 These requirements could be provided by kaolin, 
often used with amorphous silica/alumina, and a suitable binder. Alumina sols 
made by dissolving pseudoboehmite in a monobasic acid, such as formic acid, 
had previously been used to bind silica/alumina catalysts. Other binders now 
include silica sols and aluminum chlorhydroxide:21  
• The first matrix materials, based on the early catalysts, were really nonse-
lective catalysts that promoted the cracking of heavy feed molecules and 
formed some coke. They have now been further developed.  
• More selective catalysts were needed to produce gasoline of a higher oc-
tane rating, and a new more active matrix, tailored to improve octane rat-
ing, was required. During the period while these new catalysts were in-
troduced, older production units were also being updated to allow more 
reaction to take place in the riser section of the plant. Increased activity 
was achieved by including a higher proportion of zeolite in the catalyst. 
This caused the catalyst particles to be weaker, and stronger binders were 
required in the formulation. Silica sol became the most favored binder for 
high-zeolite/kaolin catalysts. These new catalysts were less prone to coke 
deposition so the process could be operated under more severe conditions. 
This led to an increase in both the rate of production and the octane num-
ber of the resulting gasoline.

• The nature of the matrix continued to be changed to cope with ever in-
creasing amounts of cracker residues added to the gas oil feedstock. Bet-
ter porosity was needed to allow larger residue molecules access to the 
active matrix pores, where they could crack into smaller fragments that, 
in turn, could enter the small zeolite pores. Alumina, and kaolin, ﬁred at 
high temperature and then acid extracted were successful components of 
an active matrix. The alumina in the matrix could also absorb poisons 
from the residues, such as the metals nickel and vanadium and some so-
dium compounds.  
More effective binders are now used to give sufficient strength to the new 
high-zeolite catalysts required for the processing of feedstocks containing high 
levels of recycled heavy ends.  
5.5. OCTANE CATALYSTS (CATALYSTS TO INCREASE OCTANE 
RATING)  
Despite the better conversion and increased yield of gasoline with REY-zeolite 
catalysts it was found that octane levels were lower because fewer oleﬁns were 
produced. This was not really a problem for a number of years because gasoline 
quality could be improved by either increasing cracking severity or using anti-
knock compounds such as tetraethyl lead (TEL) and tetramethyl lead (TML). 
About 3-ml TEL per US gallon could increase the octane number of catalytic 
cracked gasoline by five to six points.  
 
The 1970 Clean Air Act, introduced by the US Environmental Protection 
Agency, included regulations requiring the control of automobile emissions. 
Lead compounds used to increase the octane rating of gasoline were to be 
phased out from 1973. All new cars, starting with 1975 models, would be ﬁtted 
with catalytic converters and use unleaded gasoline.  
These new constraints on gasoline formulation focused attention on the de-
creased octane levels of gasoline produced with REY-zeolite cracking catalysts 
and the octane dip, or low octane number, of C6–C10 parafﬁns. To compensate, 
the aromatic content of the gasoline pool was increased from about 20% in 1973 
to almost 40%, but the need for new octane catalysts was soon an important 
objective for refiners and catalyst producers. Octane catalysts require a suitable 
zeolite that can limit the hydrogen transfer reactions that convert oleﬁns to par-
affins.  
Despite the ever increasing demand of gasoline in the 1970s, the work horse 
REY-zeolite was still widely used until octane number became a serious prob-
lem. As late as 1972, out-of-date catalysts were still used in low-yield plants by 
operators not wishing to pay more than the minimum price for catalysts. About 
90% of cracking units were using zeolites, but around 20% was the relatively 
unstable, yet cheaper, X-zeolite!19 The remaining 10% of the catalysts used were

193 
improved versions of silica/alumina catalysts dating from the 1940s. The new 
environmental requirements changed this situation and by 1979 X-zeolite was 
no longer being produced for cracking catalysts.  
 
5.5.1.  Hydrothermal Dealumination of Y-Zeolites  
 
Improvements in plant design and better operation had allowed the zeolite con-
tent of cracking catalysts to be increased from about 10% before 1972 to 15–
20% by 1975. The higher zeolite content resulted in improved conversion and 
gasoline yield. Matrix composition had also assumed a greater importance, not 
only to increase the strength of catalyst particles but also to reduce the overall 
cost by using cheap, yet stronger, fillers.  
The need for more thermal and hydrothermal stability of the zeolite became 
progressively greater as they were operated under increasingly severe condi-
tions. It was already known that higher stability could be achieved by increasing 
the silica/alumina ratio and by lowering the sodium content. Nevertheless, it was 
very difﬁcult to produce directly Y-zeolite with a silica/alumina ratio greater 
that six, and efforts to increase this ratio had led to the first de-aluminated cata-
lyst. This was first marketed as an ultrastable Y (USY)-zeolite catalyst in 1964, 
but was not readily accepted because of its lower activity compared with REY-
zeolites. It did, however, produce gasoline with more oleﬁns and a higher octane 
number. USY-zeolites also contained less sodium than Y-zeolites. The manner 
in which crystal form and sodium content of Y-zeolite changes with rare earth 
exchange and calcination is shown in Table 5.10.

The framework was dealuminated (Figure 5.6) to give a higher sili-
ca/alumina ratio and sodium was simultaneously removed from the sodalite cag-
es by high-temperature treatment of wet NaY-zeolite ﬁlter cake, following am-
monium exchange to produce HY-zeolite.22 The ﬁrst USY-zeolites were more 
stable but less active than Y-zeolites because they continued fewer, through 
stronger, acid sites (Figure 5.7). Although the unit cell size decreased slightly as 
a result of dealumination there was no loss of crystallinity and typical feed hy-
drocarbons were still converted within the supercages. Developments continued 
and a number of other high-silica Y-zeolites were eventually introduced, in par-
ticular, by calcining ammonium-exchanged Y-zeolite in a ﬂowing steam atmos-
phere at 7500C.23 Aluminium atoms are progressively removed from the zeolite 
framework by increasing the temperature and time during which the HY-zeolite 
is steamed. The unit cell size gradually decreases and eventually the zeolite 
framework collapses.  
High-silica Y-zeolites, referred to as either USY-or HSY-zeolites, have 
considerably improved thermal/hydrothermal stability. In addition to the original

pores and channels, USY-zeolites also have large pores in the size range 25–60 
Å, which are formed during dealumination. Some of the defect sites formed by 
hydrolysis of the silicon–aluminum bonds are filled by the migration and inser-
tion of noncrystalline silica to give a more stable silica framework. The dis-
placed alumina, however, remains trapped within the zeolite pore structure and 
is known as nonframework alumina (NFA). Although defect-free Y-zeolite can 
be made with a silica/alumina ratio up to 12 by using tetraalkylamine hydroxide 
templates at high temperature and pressure, the procedure is expensive and not 
widely used.24 
 
5.5.2.  Chemical Dealumination of Y-Zeolites  
 
High-silica Y-zeolites can also be prepared by chemical extraction of alumina 
despite the practical problems involved. De-aluminated Y-zeolite may be stabi-
lised by replacement of aluminium atoms in the zeolite structure by some silicon 
atoms from the solvent, or, depending upon the preparative procedure, the zeo-
lite may simply be left in a hydrogen-deleted form.  
In practice the only chemically produced HSY-zeolite to be used on a large 
scale was made by reaction of NH4Y-zeolite with ammonium ﬂuorosilicate 
196  
Chapter 5 
(AFS) under controlled, low-pH, conditions.25 Aluminum in the zeolite frame-
work is removed as ammonium ﬂuoroaluminate and replaced by silicon:  
 
 NH4Y-zeolite + (NH4)2SiF6 → AFSY-zeolite + (NH4)3AlF6  
(5.1) 
 
High-silica AFSY-zeolites have a silica/alumina ratio of about 12 and good 
hydrothermal stability. The low active site density, however, gives a low intrin-
sic activity requiring a higher proportion of the zeolite in a catalyst. AFSY-
zeolite is expensive to use because of high production costs and the need to dis-
pose of toxic effluent. The main advantage in chemical dealumination is that the 
formation of non-framework alumina is avoided. However, AFSY-zeolite is 
rarely used, because of the other difﬁculties involved.  
Nonframework alumina can also be removed from USY-zeolite catalysts by 
solution in ammonium nitrate, at pH 2.5, and washing out the aluminum nitrate 
formed. This does lead to further dealumination and, although defects remain, 
the zeolite is still very crystalline.26 The NFA-free catalysts have increased sta-
bility, produce higher-octane gasoline, have better coke selectivity, and are 
widely used. Most catalyst suppliers can provide dealuminated USY-zeolite with 
reduced nonframework alumina.  
Cracking catalysts containing more than 25% of USY-zeolite to compensate 
for lower activity became available in 1976, although they were not widely used 
until the addition of lead to gasoline was almost completely abandoned. The 
lead phase-out coincided with the introduction of steaming processes for making 
more stable USY-zeolite.  
 
5.5.3.  Increasing Octane Number  
 
The development of ultrastable Y-zeolite catalyst led to the production of gaso-
line with higher oleﬁn content and increased octane number. However, the need 
for improved catalysts continued because the zeolite was not sufficiently stable 
and the motor octane number did not rise as much as the research octane num-
ber. As discovered previously with other zeolites in the 1960’s, partial exchange 
of USY-zeolite with rare earth (REUSY) gave better stability as well as activity 
and provided more branched hydrocarbons and aromatics. Both motor octane 
number and gasoline production could thus be increased.  
Fully exchanged REUSY-zeolite, containing about 7% rare earth oxides, 
produced more gasoline but unfortunately also promoted more hydrogen transfer 
from naphthenes to oleﬁns, which decreased the octane number. By selecting an 
appropriate level of rare earth exchange a compromise between octane number, 
gasoline yield, and catalyst stability could be achieved. Octane-barrel catalysts, 
therefore, maximized the production of gasoline consistent with an acceptable 
octane level.

5.5.4.  Shape Selective Cracking  
 
The use of a small pore ZSM-5 co-catalyst with REUSY catalysts increases the 
octane number of gasoline by a process known as shape-selective cracking.27 
Straight-chain C6–C10 oleﬁns produced by normal cracking reactions and which 
are the precursors of low-octane paraffins are selectively cracked by ZSM-5 
catalysts.  
So-called centre cracking produces a C4-C5 oleﬁn fraction which rapidly 
isomerises to isobutene and isoamylene. These products were converted to me-
thyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) by re-
action with methanol to produce octane-enhancing additives for use in reformu-
lated gasoline. Propane and n-butane are also produced. Fresh ZSM-5 also 
cracks C7
+ 
paraffins until the acid site density decreases. Eventually, oleﬁn 
cracking activity declines but isomerization activity is retained. Regular addition 
of fresh ZSM-5 is therefore required to maintain the shape-selective activity.  
The introduction of shape-selective ZSM-5 additives in 1975 resulted in an 
increase in the gasoline octane number by two to four units within a few days.28 
This was weeks faster than changing to a more selective octane catalyst because 
of the long time internal needed to change significantly the composition of the 
catalyst inventing at normal replacement rates, see Table 5.11. ZSM-5 additives 
were also used with cheaper REY-zeolite catalysts to increase octane levels with 
little change in operating conditions.  
Although ZSM-5 additives have the disadvantage of decreasing gasoline 
yield by up to 2%, there is no change in dry gas, heavy oil, or coke production. 
The gasoline loss was more than compensated for by using the by-product pro-
pylene and n-butylene in an alkylation unit. By 1993, ZSM-5 additives were 
being used in 20% of the world’s FCC capacity, although very little commercial

Note: Catalyst producers provide information on the time taken to change an existing catalyst. With 
a relatively low daily replacement rate of 2% it can take 20 days to change 40% of the old catalyst 
inventory. Because the zeolite in an FCC catalyst is rapidly deactivated, more than 50% of the crack-
ing activity is supplied by catalyst less than 20 days old. Older catalyst still has some activity in the 
matrix, which converts heavier fractions.

operating data had been made available. ZSM-5 is usually added to an FCC unit 
on a daily basis with makeup catalyst. It is supplied in the form of particles con-
taining up to 15% ZSM-5 on an inert matrix. As little as 3% of the additive may 
be needed in the catalyst inventory to achieve the required improvement in gaso-
line octane. M-5 additives do not form coke and are not poisoned by basic nitro-
gen because of the lower acid site density. Similarly the ZSM-5 framework is 
extremely stable and so there is less deactivation than with typical Y-zeolites.  
5.6. RESIDUE CRACKING CATALYSTS  
Some heavy residual fractions from petroleum refineries have been added to 
FCC unit feeds since the late 1970s, when crude oil prices rose sharply. The 
processing of these more intractable fractions has partly compensated for the 
higher oil price without the need to process more crude. Although some new 
units have been designed to be able to cope with 100% residue, it is more usual 
to add about 30% of residue to gas oil feeds in conventional units (see Table 
5.2).  
The economic benefit of using cheaper residues was offset to a certain ex-
tent, by the need to use more expensive catalysts and increased catalyst makeup 
rates. The proportion of residue which can safely be added to the feed is usually 
limited by the impurity levels in the residue and the need to maintain a satisfac-
tory conversion, since use of residues generally leads to a reduction in conver-
sion. These problems have been partly overcome by the gradual introduction of 
better catalysts and the use of metal passivation additives. More effective addi-
tives continue to be developed.  
 
5.6.1.  Residual Feeds  
 
Residues include coker gas oil, atmospheric and vacuum residues, lube extracts 
and deasphalted oils.  They differ in chemical composition from vacuum gas oil.  
Typically residues contain a wide range of hydrocarbon types including polynu-
clear naphthenes, high-molecular-weight aromatics, and asphaltenes. They also 
contain signiﬁcant amounts of metal, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds. Some of 
the higher-boiling residual components are not completely vaporized during the 
cracking process and nonvolatile Conradson carbon coke levels are increased. 
Operation seems to be reasonably acceptable despite the potential problems!  
The larger molecules found in residues have diameters in the size range 
2.5–10.5 nm, with molecular weights ranging from 1000 to 100,000. This com-
pares with typical gas oil feeds, boiling in the range of about 1500–6000C, with 
molecules in the size range 1.0–2.5 nm and average molecular weights of less 
than 400.  
 
Catalytic Cracking Catalysts  
199 
 
Consequently, there are significant differences in FCC unit operation when 
residue is added to normal feed. Conversion falls and less gasoline is produced, 
as shown in Table 5.2, and the catalyst-to-oil ratio must rise as coke yields in-
crease. The coke also has a different composition relative to that produced from 
normal feed not only because of the higher Conradson carbon levels and high-
boiling compounds, which are absorbed by the catalyst particles, but also from 
the dehydrogenation activity of the metal impurities, which leads to polymeriza-
tion reactions and contaminant coke formation.  
 
5.6.2.  Residue Catalyst Formulation  
 
Catalysts used to crack gas oil to which residue has been added are generally 
quite similar to octane catalysts. They incorporate high-silica USY-zeolites, ex-
changed with rare earths and supported on a high-activity matrix. To compen-
sate for the more demanding reaction and regeneration conditions, the manufac-
turing processes for USY-zeolite have been optimized to give a more crystalline 
and thermally stable structure which produces less coke. It is necessary, howev-
er, as shown in Table 5.9, to compensate partly for rapid zeolite deactivation by 
including up to 40% REUSY-zeolite in the catalyst formulation.  
The matrix used contains a higher proportion of active alumina or sili-
ca/alumina together with natural or activated clay filler. It is important for the 
matrix to have carefully controlled large pores because of the more important 
role it plays in cracking the larger molecules present in residual feeds. The com-
position of the catalyst is set by the need to achieve a balance between zeolite 
and matrix activities.  This balance depends on the operating conditions of the 
process and the nature and quantity of residue to be mixed with the gas oil. The 
higher sulfur content of residual fractions, which increases the sulfur oxide 
emission in regenerator flue gas, often requires the use of further additives to 
meet statutory limits.  
 
5.6.3.  Coke Formation  
 
The heat balance in an FCC unit is complex and depends on the combustion of 
coke in the regenerator. Coke formation on the catalyst must be carefully con-
trolled when the feeds contains residue. Impurities such as organic nickel, vana-
dium compounds, and Conradson carbon lead to increased coke deposition and 
this affects the rest of the unit. It is necessary to passivate the metals with addi-
tives and dilute or hydrotreat the residue.  
The cracking reaction is endothermic and so requires an input of heat. This 
heat is provided by combustion of residual coke on the catalyst in the regenera-
tor. In a heat-balanced unit, the level of coke deposition is controlled so that the

amount of coke deposition is in balance with the amount of heat needed to sus-
tain reaction. A coke-selective catalyst makes more gasoline for a given coke 
content in the regenerator. The quantity of coke deposited on the catalyst varies 
with each catalyst type. 
Only part of the coke on spent catalyst is burnt in the regenerator. The dif-
ference between the amount of coke on spent and regenerated catalyst is referred 
to as delta coke (Δ coke) and is usually expressed as a percentage. At steady 
state, this equates to the overall amount of coke formed per pass. Coke yield is 
the percentage of feed that is converted to coke. A useful measure of Δ coke is 
the coke yield divided by the corresponding catalyst to oil ratio.  
When cracking residue with coke selective REUSY-zeolite catalysts, the 
low Δ coke allows more flexible operation by increasing conversion and gaso-
line selectivity at a constant coke yield. Several different types of Δ coke are 
deposited during the reaction:  
• Catalytic coke forms on acid sites by cracking or polymerization of feed 
and depends on the catalyst type.  
• Catalyst/oil coke consists of residual very high molecular weight hydro-
carbons that are not stripped from catalyst before regeneration.  
• Contaminant coke forms as a result of the dehydrogenation and polymeri-
zation reactions catalyzed by metal impurities in the feed.  
• Feed coke results from Conradson carbon, asphaltenes, or other high mo-
lecular weight compounds that do not crack in the riser.  
About 1.2–1.4% Δcoke forms on residue catalysts compared with about 
0.7– 0.8% on gasoline catalysts. The distribution of Δcoke for both types of feed 
is shown in Table 5.12. Most of the increase is associated with contaminant and 
feed coke.

5.7.  
RESIDUE CATALYST ADDITIVES  
The addition of residual fractions to gas oil feed results in an increase in the im-
purity content of the equilibrium FCC catalyst and causes a decrease in activity. 
Metal impurities exist as porphyrin complexes which crack and deposit metal 
residues on the catalyst surface, causing catalyst deactivation. The most serious 
effects on catalyst performance result from nickel and vanadium compounds. 
Sodium can also deactivate acid sites on the catalyst, but the effect is generally 
reduced by desalting crude oils and by absorption of small amounts of sodium 
on the matrix. Sulfur compounds in the feed contaminate products and regenera-
tor flue gas.  
Efforts have been made to develop additives that limit the effects of impuri-
ties in the feed. However, a practical way to counter the effect of metal impuri-
ties has been to increase the withdrawal and replacement of equilibrium catalyst 
with fresh catalyst, despite the increase in cost. Some of the ways in which met-
als and other impurities can be managed in modern FCC units are as follows:  
• When possible use a feed with low metal content. This can mean hy-
drotreating the feed, which is expensive and does not remove all the met-
al impurities. It may also be possible to use a more metal-tolerant cata-
lyst.  
• Add more fresh makeup catalyst to maintain activity. This is generally 
used for high-vanadium content feed but is expensive.  
• Use an uncontaminated equilibrium catalyst (E cat) as replacement to 
maintain activity. It is difﬁcult to obtain supplies of E cat, which is usual-
ly of variable quality and may only have a short lifetime.  
• Catalyst containing high metal impurity levels may be flushed from the 
inventory using cheaper low-activity catalyst. This does, however, dilute 
activity.  
• Use vanadium traps or nickel additives. These are not yet widely used or 
very efficient, but integral traps for FCC catalysts are being developed. 
These will dilute an active catalyst but are beneficial, particularly when 
the feed contains a high level of vanadium.  
• Magnetic separation and catalyst demetallization procedures to segregate 
or revive contaminated catalyst have good potential but more develop-
ment is needed.  
• The use of carbon monoxide combustion additives and sulfur transfer ad-
ditives help to reduce coke formation and sulfur emissions.  
 
5.7.1.  Nickel Additives  
 
Nickel compounds deposited on the catalyst surface are oxidized to nickel oxide 
in the regenerator. Despite the potentially high nickel oxide concentration in 
202  
Chapter 5 
equilibrium catalyst this does not affect zeolite activity. Nickel oxide does, how-
ever, reduce to nickel in the reaction zone and catalyses the dehydrogenation of 
hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen and coke. Increased volumes of hydrogen in 
dry gas lead to compressor limitations. Additional coke deposited on the catalyst 
increases the regenerator load and affects the unit heat balance.  
Nickel can be absorbed as an aluminate in a large pore matrix. It is also 
possible to use additives that limit dehydrogenation by forming stable nickel 
compounds. One successful additive is an antimony trisdipropyl dithiophosphate 
solution.29 Optimum nickel/antimony ratios are claimed to be in the range 1.5–5, 
depending on operating conditions and the quantity of nickel deposited. About 
96–98% of the antimony remains on the catalyst or leaves the reactor with cata-
lyst fines. Environmental metal limits for catalyst fines in the United States and 
Europe are currently 4000 ppm nickel and 1500 ppm antimony (with 7000 ppm 
vanadium), which may indicate a typical nickel/antimony ratio of about four. 
The additive can decrease hydrogen formation by 40–60% with a corresponding 
reduction in contaminant coke. Nickel passivators are generally needed if hy-
drogen production exceeds 60–75 scf/barrel of feed and it has been estimated 
that about 50% of US FCC plants with nickel in the feeds use this procedure.  
Because antimony is on the EPA list of hazardous chemicals it is sometimes 
replaced by a similar bismuth additive. Solutions of this additive contain 28 wt% 
bismuth and act in the same way.30  
 
5.7.2.  Vanadium Additives  
 
Vanadium has a more severe effect on FCC catalyst than nickel. Its most serious 
effect is to cause irreversible deactivation of the zeolite. It also has signiﬁcant 
activity for dehydrogenation (25–30% that of nickel) and this contributes to both 
coke deposition and hydrogen formation.  
When vanadium (IV) porphyrin complexes deposit on the catalyst matrix 
they are cracked and form vanadium pentoxide in the regenerator. Vanadium 
pentoxide melts at 6800C, and forms a liquid phase that diffuses through the 
catalyst. Experiments have shown that by heating mixtures of vanadium pentox-
ide and FCC catalysts at 7000C, vanadium infiltrates the catalyst particles within 
about 15 min. It has been shown by differential thermal analysis, that the zeolite 
structure is destroyed when the vanadium pentoxide melts in the temperature 
range 6300–6600C. The effect of vanadium is to shrink the zeolite unit cell by a 
dealumination mechanism, and this appears to accelerate the typical aging of 
zeolite catalysts. Vanadium also reacts with rare earths in the sodalite cages 
forming vanadates that destroy the rare earth stabilizing bridges.  
Sodium compounds accelerate vanadium deactivation of FCC catalysts. 
Under typical operating conditions, sodium hydorxide and vanadium pentoxide 
form mixed oxide phases that melt at temperatures as low as 5250C. The mixed 
salts can dissolve alumina from the zeolite and matrix during regeneration, but 
 
Catalytic Cracking Catalysts  
203 
both alumina and vanadate redeposit as the catalyst temperature falls in the reac-
tion zone.  
Early attempts to control vanadium deactivation involved the addition of 
amorphous alumina to the cracking catalyst matrix. This was not particularly 
suitable because alumina increased coke formation and led to wider dispersion 
of nickel impurities. Hydrodesulfurization of FCC feeds is useful; it not only 
removes sulfur, but the desulfurisation catalyst also adsorbs a significant propor-
tion of the metal porphyrins.  
The easiest procedures to compensate for vanadium poisoning are to in-
crease the zeolite content of the catalyst or to replace a larger proportion of the 
catalyst inventory every day. Those options are expensive and when equilibrium 
catalyst contains more than about 5000 ppm of vanadium it is more cost effec-
tive to use a vanadium trap. The role of the trap is to stop the migration of vana-
dium and therefore to prevent deactivation of the zeolite. The trap must not in-
terfere with the cracking reaction and must maintain the vanadium at a lower 
oxidation state with a high melting point.  
Early traps contained butyl tin compounds, and reduced the deactivation ef-
fect of vanadium by 30% and the dehydrogenation activity by 50%31 as soon as 
it entered the reactor.28 Tin, however, poisoned FCC catalysts if used in large 
quantities and had no effect on the vanadium already on a catalyst. More recent-
ly, traps derived from basic alkaline earth oxides, such as strontium titanate, 
were claimed to reduce zeolite deactivation by 90%.32 Unfortunately, in full-
scale operation, these traps were poisoned by sulfur oxides forming very stable 
and intractable sulfates, and are not often used.  
The most effective traps currently available are based on supported rare 
earth oxides, such as those of cerium, plus promoters and absorb signiﬁcantly 
more vanadium than the catalyst. The trap may be added to the matrix or used as 
separate particles if the quantity required would excessively dilute the zeolite 
content or affect the strength of the FCC catalyst. Intercat V-trap additive has 
been shown to absorb 17 times more vanadium than a FCC catalyst.33 Many 
suppliers now provide catalysts with integral metal traps. For example, Engel-
hard Ultrium catalyst traps vanadium on a magnesium-based component and the 
activity of the nickel-based contaminant is reduced by agglomeration onto the 
surface of the catalyst particle. Millenium catalyst absorbs porphyrin molecules 
onto a surface alumina compound, where they are immobilized.34 Demetallizing 
processes, which remove nickel and vanadium from spent FCC catalysts so that 
they can be recycled, have been developed but are not yet widely accepted.35  
 
5.7.3.  Sulfur Oxides Transfer Additives  
 
Sulfur emissions from FCC units cause to atmospheric pollution problems and 
refineries have to control the sulfur oxide (SOX) content of regenerator flue gas 
to comply with local or national restrictions.

In 1978 the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) of 
California announced that the limit on FCC flue gas SOX emissions would be 
130 kg SOX per 1000 barrels of feed by 1981. This was then reduced to 60 kg 
SOX per 1000 barrels of feed by 1987. A further proposal, in 1990, suggested 
that emissions should eventually be lowered to 6-kg  SOX  per  1000  barrels of  
feed. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency, while establishing no lim-
its, has specified the options available to reduce SOX emissions. These are the 
use of flue gas scrubbing, feed hydrodesulfurization, SOX additives, or low sul-
fur feeds. In Europe SOX emissions were included in an overall refinery sulfur 
emission limit and not treated separately. The sulfur content of reformulated 
gasoline has also been restricted by the EPA. 
Most FCC unit feeds contain sulfur compounds, which become distributed 
among the reaction products as shown in Table 5.13. When residues are added 
to the feed, the coke contains a significantly increased amount of sulfur, which 
is oxidized in the regenerator, and becomes the SOX component of the flue gas. 
Although most sulfur compounds in the feed can be removed by hydrotreating, 
the more refractory sulfur compounds that deposit in the coke are less easily 
hydrogenated. Residual sulfur oxides as well as particulates can be removed 
from the flue gas by scrubbing. However, both options are expensive to install 
and operate. For this reason, it is usually more economic to use a sulfur transfer 
additive. Additives absorb sulfur oxides in the regenerator, forming reactive 
sulfates that are reduced to hydrogen sulfide on returning to the reactor. Hydro-
gen sulfide in light gas is then removed in an existing downstream sulfur recov-
ery unit.  
Additives must rapidly absorb sulfur dioxide and trioxide as it is produced 
during catalyst regeneration. The resulting sulfate is then reduced in the reactor 
and stripper to regenerate the additive and continue the cycle. The reactions tak-
ing place are shown schematically in Table 5.14.  
It was observed during the 1970s that high-alumina catalysts partly fulﬁlled 
these requirements. However, sulfur oxides in the flue gas were only decreased 
by about 20% because aluminum sulfate decomposes at a relatively low temper-
ature of 5800C. Better absorbents were then investigated. Cerium oxide support-
ed on alumina improved the absorption of sulfur trioxide, but performance

was still affected by partial decomposition of the sulfate as in the high-
temperature regenerators. Better results still were obtained with cerium oxide 
supported on magnesia, which absorbed sulfur trioxide to form magnesium sul-
fate. This was stable in the regenerator but did not reduce completely to hydro-
gen sulfide in the reactor. 
A solid solution of about 10% cerium oxide in the lattice of magnesium alu-
minate spinel proved to be a more effective sulfur transfer agent. It is important, 
however, that the spinel does not contain any free magnesium oxide because this 
will be converted to magnesium sulfate during service. Magnesium sulfate is not 
reduced to hydrogen sulfide at temperatures below 7300C, which is somewhat 
greater than the temperature of the reactor. The addition of a chromium compo-
nent gives an increase in the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide in the 
regenerator.  
Magnesia/alumina spinels are not prepared by precipitation for this applica-
tion because it is difﬁcult to wash the gelatinous precipitate free of cations, and 
any residual sodium causes the deactivation of zeolites. Suitable additives have 
to be prepared either by mixing extremely small particles (2–5 μm) of magnesia 
and alumina in water or mixing magnesium acetate with alumina sol and spray 
drying the mixtures at 7500C. This produces the desired magnesia-rich spinel 
with no free magnesium oxide. The spinel can be impregnated with cerium and 
chromium nitrate solutions before final calcination.  
Commercial trials with the additive in full-scale FCC units have seen a re-
duction in SOX emissions by 50–80%. Since the first commercial trial of SOX 
transfer additives was reported in 1984 about 40% of US refineries have tested 
additives to eliminate SOX from effluent gas. Several different additives are 
commercially available but despite the relatively good results, not many refiner-
ies use them on a regular basis unless there is an economic or political reason to 
do so.

Sulfur oxide transfer additives work more effectively if a combustion pro-
moter such as platinum is used to oxidize sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide more 
efficiently. More additive is required when a unit is operating under less oxidiz-
ing conditions and the coke is only partially converted to carbon dioxide.  
Metals do not poison SOX additives and reduction of the spinel surface area 
does not seem to affect sulfate formation. Silica does, however, deposit on the 
surface and decreases sulfur pickup. Normal life of a SOX additive is about 28 
days.  
 
5.7.4.  Bottoms Cracking Additive  
 
When residual fractions boiling above 4500C are cracked on a high-activity ma-
trix, the matrix is quickly deactivated by the high levels of metal impurity and 
Conradson carbon. A bottom-cracking additive can be added to reduce coke 
deposition when using a high proportion of residue in the feed. If necessary, a 
vanadium metal trap can also be included.  
Use of between 5–10% of a cracking additive can reduce the amount of 
heavy-cycle oil by converting it to more valuable products and minimizing 
thermal cracking. The additive does not contain any zeolite and is basically a 
stable, high-activity 30% silica/50% alumina material with a suitable binder and 
additives such as rare earth oxides.  
5.8.  
REFORMULATED GASOLINE  
The FCC process has been upgraded continuously since it was introduced in 
1942. Two of the original three units built by Standard Oil of New Jersey at Ba-
ton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1942–1943 were still operating well after 1992.2 Com-
bined production of PCLA 2 and 3 had been increased from 34,000 bpd of gas 
oil in 1943 to 188,000 bpd in 1992. PCLA 1 was dismantled in 1963 after ex-
pansion of the original 15,000 bpd capacity to 41,000 bpd. Many similar suc-
cessful improvements have been made at other reﬁneries.36 Table 5.15 shows 
how the developments in the FCC process and catalysts made this possible. It 
was a dynamic and flexible process. Further demands were made when reformu-
lated gasoline was introduced, first in the United States and then in other parts of 
the world.  
The US Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970 required that automobile exhaust 
emissions be regulated to meet new environmental standards. From 1975 all new 
models were to be fitted with catalytic combustion converters to reduce levels of 
carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust. This led to the 
phase-out of lead additives in gasoline between 1973 and 1996. To compensate 
for the loss of octane rating of the gasoline more reformate and alkylate needed 
to be added. Octane catalysts were also developed for FCC units and the aromat-

ic content of gasoline was doubled from 20% to about 40% by using more 
reformate.  
Amendments to the Act in 1989 resulted in changes in the actual composi-
tion of gasoline and became part of the CAA in 1990. The purpose of the chang-
es was to lower the toxic and ozone-forming volatile emissions from gasoline 
evaporation during the summer months. In phase 1 of the summer gasoline pro-
gram, Reid vapor pressure (RVP) was set to a maximum level according to lo-
cality. This meant using less butane, adding even more alkylate and including an 
oxygen-containing compound such as methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) to 
premium gasoline. The use of oxygenates to promote cleaner burning, to limit 
carbon monoxide formation and to increase octane levels.  
Phase 2 of the amendments was instituted in 1992 and later became part of 
the CAA. This demanded even more stringent conditions on exhaust emissions, 
together with a further reduction of RVP. From November 1992 the oxygenated 
gasoline program required that up to 2.7 wt% oxygen be added to gasoline dur-
ing the winter months in areas not meeting the carbon monoxide reduction 
standard. From January 1995, the reformulated gasoline program demanded 
further reductions in the ozone pollution levels.  
208  
Chapter 5 
The 1990–1997 Federal Phase 1 simple model for reformulated gasoline 
was:  
• RVP 7.1 psi (south); 8.0 psi (north)  
• Benzene 0.95 vol%  
• Oxygen 2.1 wt%  
• Oleﬁns 8.5 vol% (less than 1990 base line)  
• Sulfur 130 ppm (less than 1990 base line)  
The complex model from January 1998 was the same, apart from changes in 
the baseline gasoline properties.  
Signiﬁcant changes to the unit operation of FCC units have been made so 
that the gasoline pool complies with these new regulations. Three modiﬁcations 
to the catalysts were required to achieve those new standards:  
• Isobutylene and isoamylene production was increased by using up to 10% 
ZSM-5 additive to provide feed for MTBE and TAME production.  
• The volumes of isobutane, propylene, and butylenes was also increased to 
provide feed for alkylation units.  
• USY-zeolite with a very low level of rare earth exchange and an active 
matrix was used to increase gasoline oleﬁns and to decrease aromatic 
formation by limiting hydrogen transfer.  
These changes decrease gasoline yield but give better coke selectivity. The 
rare earth content of the zeolite and the proportion of ZSM-5 added above the 
10% level are usually optimized as required to meet a given product range.37 
This is necessary because the usual operating limit is the wet gas compressor 
capacity available to separate LPG. In order to comply with the sulfur regulation 
it may also be useful to hydrotreat the feed to a FCC unit. This has the additional 
benefit of reducing the nickel, vanadium, and Conradson carbon contents.  
When using typical high rare-earth zeolite catalysts, a lower metal content 
in the feed significantly increases conversion, giving higher yields of CPG and 
fewer oleﬁns. However, the gasoline produced has a low octane rating. Con-
versely, when using low rare-earth catalyst with a ZSM-5 additive, conversion 
can be higher with the production of more isobutylene and propylene which can 
be used to increase alkylation and MTBE capacity.  
There is even more potential to improve gasoline yield as well as LPG 
oleﬁns such as isobutene by using a catalyst that incorporates the properties of a 
ZSM-5 additive. This type of catalyst may also provide better conversion of 
light-cycle oil and residues because it has larger pores than ZSM-5.38 
 
When the gas oil feed contains significant residue, it is necessary to control 
carefully the level of metal impurity on the equilibrium catalyst. The various 
metal passivation technologies introduced and the other additives used can affect 
the unit operation and this must also be taken into account.

6.1.  
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CATALYTIC REFINERY PROCESSES  
The conversion of distillates into more useful products and the use of off-gases 
were among the major early developments in the reﬁning industry. Hydrogena-
tion of aromatics in kerosene with nickel catalysts was being tested around 
1906–1910, as a method of improving burning qualities.1 As gasoline for auto-
mobiles became the most important reﬁnery product during the period from 
1900 onward, the need for increased production and better quality dominated the 
industry. Fears of future shortages led to the realization that better use had to be 
made of the crude oil available. Development of thermal cracking processes 
increased reﬁnery gasoline yields and it was found that unsaturated hydrocar-
bons in the gasoline improved engine performance.  
As conventional spark ignition internal combustion engines developed and 
compression ratios were increased, problems with pre-ignition of the gaso-
line/air mixture caused knocking. The concept of octane rating evolved to com-
pare different gasolines and to produce high octane antiknock additives. The 
octane number was determined by comparing gasoline with a mixture of iso-
octane and normal heptane. This emphasized the fact that branched-chain mole-
cules were desirable gasoline components, whereas straight-chain paraffins all 
have a low octane number.  
The gasoline pool in a reﬁnery is now based on the most efﬁcient available 
blends of high-octane components. The proportion of crude oil treated in catalyt-
ic processes and the average contribution of these processes to the US gasoline 
pool are given in Table 6.1. From the 1920s until the 1970s tetraethyl lead, the

most efﬁcient antiknock additive discovered was added to improve the octane 
rating of gasoline.  
Gasolines derived by cracking were always more valuable than those from 
straight-run naphthas, and Shell decided that heavy naphtha could probably be 
converted into a better-quality gasoline by cracking. The thermal reforming pro-
cess was introduced by UOP in 1931.2 While higher-octane gasoline was pro-
duced, as expected, large volumes of waste gases containing oleﬁns were also 
formed and this reduced the yield. Up to this point no catalysts were used in 
gasoline production. A search then began for suitable ways to convert fuel value 
oleﬁns to high-octane liquid hydrocarbons with boiling points in the desired 
gasoline range.  
In 1932, UOP showed that C3/C4 oleﬁns separated from the thermal cracker 
off-gas could be polymerized to dimers with a phosphoric acid catalyst. This 
gave polymer gasoline with an octane number in the range 83–87. Later, when 
the Catpoly process became more widely used, propylene and butylenes were 
separated to provide the optimum catalyst conditions for the dimerisation of 
each oleﬁn separately. The C4 dimer could be hydrogenated to provide the even 
more useful iso-octane for aviation gasoline. It was clear that low-molecular-
weight oleﬁns were to become important building blocks, and in 1935 Phillips 
introduced a cracking process to produce propylene and butylene from the cor-
responding paraffins.

In the meantime Gulf and Shell had started to recycle off-gas from thermal 
reformers with the heavy naphtha feed to the process. The Gulf co-reforming 
and Shell polyforming processes provided up to 5% greater yields of higher-
octane gasoline,2 probably by an acid-catalyzed alkylation mechanism. Further 
development work by Shell, started in 1928, showed that the isobutylene in 
mixed C4 hydrocarbons dissolved in cold 60% sulfuric acid. Then, after heating 
the acid, an oily layer containing about 65% of di-isobutylene separated. Iso-
octane was produced by hydrogenation of the di-isobutylene and Shell delivered 
its ﬁrst tank load of the product in 1935.3 This cold acid process was almost im-
mediately replaced by a hot acid process in which all butylenes were dissolved 
at elevated temperatures and polymerized. The yields could be doubled, but the 
octane level fell from 97/98 to 96/97.4 Cold and hot acid polymerization pre-
sumably led to the alkylation process introduced by Shell and Anglo-Iranian Oil 
(now BP) in 1938.5 High-octane gasoline was produced by an alkylation reaction 
between butenes and isobutane using cold concentrated sulfuric acid as the cata-
lyst. Thus, from 1938 onwards, an alkylation process was available to produce 
isooctane directly, without the need for a hydrogenation step. A second financial 
benefit was the economic use of oleﬁns and an increased yield from combining a 
paraffin with the oleﬁn molecule. Alkylation capacity was rapidly installed de-
spite the capital cost of the new plant, and the dimerisation of oleﬁns became 
unattractive.  
One early limitation in the use of alkylation processes was a shortage of 
isobutane in reﬁneries. In some reﬁneries, however, further supplies of isobutane 
could be extracted from natural gas. Where this was not possible, the butane in 
off-gas could be isomerized to isobutane using a new process which used an 
acid aluminum chloride catalyst. Shell, for example, operated an isomerization 
pilot plant at Pernis, in Holland, from 1939.6  
A major disadvantage of the alkylation process was the accumulation of 
waste sulfuric acid which had no value unless it could be reused by chemical 
works close to the reﬁneries. This led, in 1942, to the development of the Phil-
lips process in which hydroﬂuoric acid replaced sulfuric acid, and could be re-
covered relatively easily by distillation.7  
In this chapter, the use of catalysts in various major refinery processes is 
described. Catalytic cracking processes and catalysts are the subject of Chapter 5. 
6.2. POLYMER GASOLINE  
Low-molecular-weight polymers can be obtained by processing reﬁnery off-gas 
containing mixed C3/C4 hydrocarbons. Various products are obtained, depending 
on the gas composition and operating conditions, but the process has generally 
been used  to  make polymer  gasolines in the C6–C9 range. This is an acid-catalyzed  
214 
Chapter 6 
1930’s. The catalyst is prepared by extrusion of a paste made from phosphoric 
acid and kieselguhr. The concentration of the acid within the pore structure is 
critical to the performance of the catalyst. Some water is essential for the reac-
tion; it is required to provide sufficient protons to initiate the reaction. If there is 
too much water, then the hydrogen ion concentration is too low to sustain the 
reaction at a satisfactory rate. Where there is too little water, the catalyst activity 
is too high, and this leads to the formation of polymers that block the pores of 
the catalyst bed.  
When water is removed from a strong aqueous solution of phosphoric acid, 
(H3PO4), some dehydration of the acid takes place, and some pyrophosphoric 
acid is formed:  
 
  
2 H3PO4 → H4PO7 + H2O  
(6.1) 
 
So-called 100% acid is a mixture comprising 88% orthophosphoric acid, 
6% pyrophosphporic acid and 6% water. The optimum catalyst for the alkylation 
reaction contains 102% phosphoric acid and therefore contains an even higher 
concentration of pyrophosphoric acid.  
There is a small loss of water during reaction, and this must be replaced 
continuously by addition of water to the feed gases to maintain catalyst perfor-
mance. The speciﬁcations for early polymerization catalysts are given in Table 
6.2. Total phosphoric acid (wt%) is the amount of acid that has combined with 
the support and that cannot be extracted with cold water. The specifications of 
two typical dehydrogenation catalysts are given in Table 6.3  
The oleﬁn polymerization reaction is exothermic and the reactor design de-
pends on the oleﬁn content of feed gas. For polygasoline production the oleﬁn 
content is usually in the range 50–60% and a tube-cooled reactor is used. Tem-
perature control is important because phosphate esters can form at temperatures 
below about 1500C, while at temperatures above about 2300C, thermal cracking 
or gum forming reactions are likely. In both cases the catalyst loses activity (Ta-
ble 6.4).

The extent of polymerization of the reactants is determined by the operating 
pressure. With reaction conditions of 70 atm pressure and a temperature of 160–
2000C, the product boils in the range 77–2200C, whereas lower molecular 
weight product boiling in the range 36–2300C is produced at 35 atm and 190–
2400C. The operating conditions reported in 1946 for a plant producing isobu-
tylene and di-isobutylene are shown in Table 6.5. In many wartime plants di-
isobutylene was hydrogenated to provide high-octane aviation fuel.9 
Propylene can be polymerized to produce the tetramers and higher oleﬁns, 
and these were used until the 1960s for detergent alkyl benzene production. 
Fixed bed reactors were used with lower oleﬁn concentrations of 20–25% in the 
feed gas. During the period from 1939 to 1945 alkylated benzenes were used to 
increase the octane number of aviation fuel. In the United States,  in 1942,  Shell

produced cumene by the alkylation of benzene with propylene, while ICI used 
the same process to alkylate benzene with butylenes in the United Kingdom. 
Both processes used the phosphoric acid/kieselguhr catalyst; details of the ICI 
operation are given in Table 6.6. Cumene later became important as the major 
source of phenol and acetone.  
Polymerization processes are very exothermic and a high recycle of paraf-
fins is needed to control the temperature rise. In benzene alkylation processes 
there should be a large recycle of benzene partly for the same reason, but also to 
suppress polyalkylate formation.

TABLE 6.8. Sulfuric Acid and Hydrogen Fluoride Alkylation. 
 
6.3.1.  Liquid Acid Processes  
 
All commercial plants operate with a high proportion of isobutane in the cir-
culating gas and conversion depends on the residence time of the gas in the reac-
tor. Typical feeds include oleﬁns derived from catalytic cracking and, more re-
cently, the refnates from MTBE or TAME units. Typical operating conditions 
are summarized in Table 6.8. Some of the acid catalyst must be removed on a 
continuous basis for recovery as it becomes diluted with inactive hydrocarbons. 
Sulfuric acid must be reused in other processes or recovered off-site for resale, a 
process which costs more than fresh acid. Hydrogen fluoride is usually recov-
ered on site and reused.10  
 
6.3.2. The Mechanism of Alkylation with an Acid Catalyst  
 
The generally accepted mechanism for the alkylation reaction is as follows:  
• Initiation. Butylene combines with a hydrogen ion to form a secondary 
butyl carbonium ion: 
 
+ 
 
  
CH3CH=CHCH3 + H+   →   CH3CH2CHCH3  
(6.2) 
 
• Isomerism. The secondary butyl carbenium ion can then either isomerize 
to form a tertiary butyl carbonium ion:

• Propagation. The C+ 
carbonium ion reacts with an isobutane molecule by 
hydrogen transfer to give the C8 paraffin and to generate a tertiary C4

carbonium ion that continues the sequence of alkylation reactions.  
A number of side reactions can also take place such as:  
• The decomposition of a C8
+ 
carbonium ion to the C8 oleﬁn and a hydro-
gen ion. This is likely at either a low isobutane/oleﬁn ratio or low acid 
strength.  
• Reaction of a C8
+
 carbonium ion with another C4 oleﬁn molecule to form 
a C12
+ 
 carbonium ion. This can react with an isobutane molecule to give a 
C12 parafﬁn, but in the presence of excess oleﬁn, further chain growth can 
take place.  
 
6.3.3.  Liquid Acid Operating Conditions  
 
During operation hydrocarbons are emulsiﬁed in acid, ensuring that the oleﬁn is 
not in excess, and reacts quickly. Operating pressure is adjusted depending on 
the boiling point of the hydrocarbon mixture and the need to dissolve the hydro-
carbons. The space velocity of the mixed oleﬁns and the catalyst is regulated, 
depending on the octane level of the product needed and operating temperature. 
Octane levels increase if the acid strength is low, which means that more spent 
acid has to be removed from the system. In sulfuric acid alkylation the optimum 
acid strength decreases with propylene, butylene, and pentylene feeds.

6.3.4. Processes Using Solid-State Acid Catalysts  
 
Several solid acid catalysts were tested in the laboratory for the alkylation of 
ethylene with isobutane following the introduction of the sulfuric acid alkylation 
process.11 These were mostly derived from aluminum chloride or boron triﬂuo-
ride and were never used in the full-scale production of alkylates. 
Operators have always hoped that a successful solid acid catalyst would be 
discovered because of the problems and hazards involved in handling large 
quantities of sulfuric and hydroﬂuoric acids. This situation reached a climax in 
1990, when California reﬁneries were faced with the possibility of having to 
close down units using HF catalysts. From about that time, potential solid-state 
acid catalysts were investigated by catalyst producers and several have been 
tested in pilot units.12 In the meantime, although modifications were introduced 
to HF units and additives were used to reduce the volatility of the acid, the pro-
cess has been less popular than the sulfuric acid process.13 The short-term alter-
native of converting HF units to the use of sulfuric acid was much more expen-
sive than the use of additives.  
Suitable solid acids have been difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Those used for benzene al-
kylation are not sufficiently acidic for economic operation and, also, the oleﬁn 
can polymerize on the catalyst surface. This blocks the active sites and prevents 
adequate hydrogen transfer. Frequent regeneration of the catalyst is not econom-
ic. The use of antimony pentaﬂuoride slurried with the hydrocarbons is one of 
the options that has been investigated in recent years.12  
The best solution appears to be the use of an almost insoluble liquid catalyst 
held within the pores of a suitable inert support. Supported liquid catalysts are 
well known and can be used with a continuous catalytic regeneration system 
similar to that developed for catalytic reforming processes. Haldor Topsøe has 
successfully tested triﬂuoromethane sulfonic acid in this way since 1993 with a 
variety of oleﬁn feeds.14 No formal regeneration was necessary apart from peri-
odic removal of some catalyst for reimpregnation and the recovery of dissolved 
acid from the alkylate. Both catalyst and support are, therefore, recirculated. The 
small quantity of polymeric by-products formed (acid soluble oil) appears to be 
less than that formed in the sulfuric acid process, but slightly more than in the 
HF process.  
6.4. HYDROTREATING  
Sulfur impurities in products manufactured from crude oil products are undesir-
able because hydrogen sulﬁde, sulfur dioxide, etc., formed during product use. 
For many years it was possible to obtain acceptable quality gasoline and kero-
sene by selecting low-sulfur, or sweet, crude oils. Sour crude oils contain dis-
222 
Chapter 6 
solved hydrogen sulﬁde, mercaptans, organic sulﬁdes, thiophenes, and elemental 
sulfur in varying amounts. These could be sweetened by a number of chemical 
processes. High-sulfur crude oils were more difﬁcult to desulfurize and the 
chemical and solvent extraction processes were combined with or replaced by 
relatively cheap and more efﬁcient catalytic processes that could also remove 
gum-forming compounds from cracked gasolines.  
For a short time from 1946 bauxite or fuller’s earth was used without the 
addition of hydrogen.15 It was found that sulﬁdes and mercaptans reacted with 
impurities in the bauxite and that this together with some mild cracking of hy-
drocarbons produced sufﬁcient hydrogen to hydrogenate thiophenes. It was soon 
realized that the catalytic desulfurization was actually a mild, selective hydro-
genation process that did not saturate aromatics.16 
During the 1950s, co-
balt/molybdate catalysts supported on bauxite or Fuller’s earth were used. These 
were similar to the catalysts developed for coal hydrogenation and which were 
also used to desulfurize steam reforming feeds. The new catalysts were most 
effective when hydrogen was added to the feed. This also had the effect of re-
ducing the deposition of carbon, and allowed for longer operating cycles before 
regeneration was necessary. More effective cobalt/molybdate catalysts were 
developed using γ-alumina as support. The activation step for the catalyst in-
volved the formation of metal sulﬁdes, and when the catalyst was pre-sulﬁded 
before use, it was found that light distillates, kerosene and even crude oils could 
be treated effectively with these catalysts.18 Operating conditions depended on 
the boiling range of the fraction being treated. Catalyst temperature was usually 
limited to about 4000C in order to avoid excessive carbon deposition while total 
pressure was increased from 300–500 psig for low-boiling distillates and up to 
700–1000 psig for higher-boiling or cracked feeds. Liquid space velocity was 
usually up to 8 h-1, with a hydrogenn/oil ratio of about 1000 scf of hydrogen per 
barrel of feed for low-sulfur distillates. Lower space velocities, in the range from 
0.5–3 h-1, with hydrogen/oil ratios up to 10,000 scf per barrel, needed to be used 
for higher-boiling residues. In the hydrotreating of heavy feeds, more carbon 
was deposited by thermal cracking than in the hydrotreating of lighter feeds.  
Catalyst regeneration was required after operation for less than 24h. 
The use of hydrodesulfurization became more widespread as catalytic naph-
tha reforming processes were introduced. The operation of platinum catalysts 
needed an increasingly strict sulfur speciﬁcation for the naphtha, and as a bonus, 
the cheap by-product hydrogen from the reforming process could be used to 
hydrotreat other reﬁnery product streams.  
By the early 1960s, hydrotreating capacity in the United States had in-
creased to 2.5 million bpd, with catalyst lifetimes averaging about 5 years. The 
use of hydrotreating was extended to kerosene, gas oil, and vacuum gas oils as 
government regulations on sulfur emissions became more stringent and as better 
cobalt molybdate catalysts became available. By the late 1970s, when atmos-
pheric and vacuum residues were also being desulfurized, US hydrotreating ca-
 
Refinery Catalysts  
223 
pacity had increased to about eight million bpd. By 1999 US capacity exceeded 
10 million bpd, with more than 35 million bpd being treated worldwide.  
 
6.4.1. What Is Hydrotreating?  
 
The term hydrodesulfurization was used to describe processes that removed sul-
fur compounds from crude oil fractions by reaction with hydrogen. As the pro-
cesses evolved to include nitrogen and oxygen removal, together with the hy-
drogenation of aromatics and oleﬁns, the group of processes became known as 
hydrotreating. Hydrotreatment simply results in the conversion of organic sul-
fur, nitrogen, and oxygen compounds to hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulﬁde, 
ammonia, or water, respectively. At the same time oleﬁns and aromatics may be 
converted to saturated hydrocarbons without any cracking of the hydrocarbons. 
When high-boiling crude oil fractions are hydrotreated under more severe condi-
tions a proportion of the heavy molecules may crack as impurities are removed. 
For this reason it is now common to refer to processes that crack a relatively 
small proportion of the light feeds while sulfur or other impurities are removed 
as hydroreﬁning.  
Deliberate reduction in the molecular weight of heavy feeds was introduced 
with the hydrocracking process (Section 6.5). This operates at high pressure, and 
heavy gas oils and residual fractions are converted to gasoline or other desirable 
products. Obviously there can be an overlap in deﬁning processes where some 
precracking is an advantage to reﬁneries. When an overall description is re-
quired, the term hydroprocessing is often used.  
 
6.4.2. Hydrotreating Processes  
 
In the early hydrotreating processes, sulfur compounds were removed from the 
light hydrocarbon fractions used in gasoline by hydrogenation over co-
balt/molybdate catalysts to produce hydrogen sulﬁde and a saturated hydrocar-
bon. Around the same time, it was found that nickel/molybdate catalysts were 
more active for the hydrogenation of nitrogen compounds to ammonia and a 
hydrocarbon while also giving some saturation of oleﬁns and aromatics.  
In modern reﬁneries both cobalt/molybdate and nickel/molybdate catalysts 
are now widely used in the puriﬁcation of various crude oil fractions. These in-
clude:  
• Straight-run naphthas, used as feedstock for catalytic reforming and 
steam reforming processes. They must contain less than 1 ppm of sulfur 
and nitrogen to avoid poisoning platinum or nickel catalysts.  
• Cracked gasoline, to hydrogenate undesirable sulfur and nitrogen com-
pounds as well as oleﬁns.  
224 
Chapter 6 
• Middle distillates such as diesel fuel, kerosene, jet fuel, domestic heating 
oil, and other gas oils, to remove sulfur for environmental reasons. Hy-
drotreating is also used to increase the smoke point or cetane number by 
hydrogenating aromatic components.  
• Vacuum gas oils, used as catalytic cracker or hydrocracker feeds, to re-
move sulfur, nitrogen, and metal impurities.  
• Atmospheric and vacuum residues, to remove as much sulfur as possible 
to provide low-sulfur fuel oils. It is also used to hydrogenate asphaltenes 
and porphyrins to reduce both Conradson carbon and metal contents.  
As the boiling point and the speciﬁc gravity of the fractions increase, more 
severe hydrotreating operating conditions are needed. A lower space velocity 
and more extensive hydrogen recycle are needed to limit deactivation of the cat-
alyst by deposition of coke. The catalyst must be regenerated after shorter inter-
vals and discarded more often than when using light fractions.  
A very brief summary of typical operating conditions is shown in Table 6.9 
although these can vary signiﬁcantly for different crude oils and blends contain-
ing cracked fractions.  
 
6.4.2.1. Catalyst Production and Operation  
 
Hydrotreating catalysts are usually produced by impregnating preformed γ-
alumina supports with aqueous solutions of ammonium molybdate. Particles are 
then dried and calcined. Molybdenum oxide forms a uniform surface layer on 
the alumina by reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups. It is important that the 
surface area of the alumina is consistent with the amount of molybdenum oxide 
required for the hydrotreating catalyst speciﬁcation (typically 1 wt% MoO3 ≡ 12 
m2 g-1 area).19

The molybdenum-treated alumina is then impregnated with either cobalt or 
nickel nitrate solutions and again dried and calcined. Several reactions can take 
place during the calcination step. At temperatures in the range 400–5000C, co-
balt and nickel nitrates decompose to form oxides on the molybdena/alumina 
catalyst surface. The deposition of cobalt and nickel in contact with the molyb-
denum on the catalyst surface is important in forming active sites. As the tem-
peratures are increased both cobalt and nickel oxides react to form aluminates 
close to the alumina surface. Cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) produces the charac-
teristic blue color of cobalt/molybdate catalysts. The nickel and cobalt ions mi-
grate into the alumina particles as the temperature is increased to 650–7000C, 
forming bulk aluminates. These are not active catalyst precursors and the tem-
perature of calcinations must be carefully limited to avoid their formation.  
A typical support can be prepared by mixing boehmite [AlO(OH)] and wa-
ter to form a smooth paste, often adding a small volume of dilute nitric acid to 
peptize the alumina to give increased strength. The paste is extruded to form 
small-diameter, relatively long, spaghetti-like cylinders, rings, and other shapes, 
or the boehmite can be granulated to produce spheres. The supports are dried 
and then calcined at up to 6000C to produce γ-alumina. It is common practice to 
add up to 1% of silica, often as montmorillonite or bentonite, to stabilize the γ-
alumina at high operating temperatures and to act as a lubricant during extru-
sion. Addition of phosphoric acid appears to produce phosphate groups on the 
alumina surface that inhibit coke formation as well as to improve molybdenum 
dispersion.21 Finally, small amounts of potash can be added to reduce surface 
acidity and to control coke formation. Typical catalyst specifications are given 
in Table 6.10 and some catalyst are shown in Figure 6.3.  
When using heavy feeds, particularly residues, the catalyst pores at the top 
of the bed soon become blocked with metals and high molecular-weight hydro-
carbons present in the feed. This reduces catalyst activity and the catalyst must 
be regenerated. In an attempt to overcome the problem and to increase the cycle 
time, so-called bimodal catalysts were introduced containing both large and 
small pores. Small particles of cellulose, combustible polymers, or carbon were 
mixed with the boehmite and burned out during the ﬁnal calcination step of the 
formation of the γ-alumina support. By using different techniques it was possi-
ble to generate pores shaped like bottles which could contain large molecules, 
and large pores which gave access to small subsidiary pores. These special sup-
ports extended the operating cycle before the catalyst had to be regenerated or 
discarded.  
 
6.4.2.2. Catalyst Handling  
 
The catalyst is supported by a layer of relatively large inert spheres, and must be 
packed carefully into the reactor. Dense-loading procedures to increase the 
packing density of the catalyst are now  available that use a rotating disk at  the

ﬂow of the reactants. In older plants, wire mesh baskets were often placed on top 
of the catalyst bed and ﬁlled with pebbles. These were part of the vessel design 
to catch solids and to distribute liquid feed, and were known as trash baskets. 
Although still in use, better ﬁltering of the feed and graded catalyst layers with 
the larger catalyst particles at the top of the beds have largely replaced the use of 
baskets.  
 
6.4.2.3. Activating the Catalyst  
 
Hydrotreating catalyst is activated by presulﬁding with hydrogen sulﬁde. This is 
achieved by circulating sulfur compounds in a stream of hydrogen at tempera-
tures too low to reduce the oxides to metals. Small molybdenum disulﬁde plate-
lets (truncated hexagons) that incorporate cobalt or nickel ions at the plate edges 
are formed to produce the active CoMoS or NiMoS sites. The surface area of the 
alumina support is critical to achieve the appropriate distribution of molyb-
denum, and the optimum ratio of nickel or cobalt to molybdenum is approxi-
mately 1:4. In the case of cobalt molybdate, if the atomic ratio exceeds 30:1, 
cobalt sulﬁde (Co9S8) crystals form on the molybdenum disulﬁde in preference

to the active mixed sulﬁde. The subsurface cobalt/aluminate does not sulﬁde. 
The same mechanism probably applies to nickel/molybate and the metal ratio 
should be controlled to avoid the formation of nickel sulﬁde (Ni3S2).  
Catalyst can be presulﬁded in the reactor in a controlled manner using the 
following procedure:  
• The reactor is freed from moisture by purging with dry air, before purg-
ing with nitrogen to remove oxygen. Hydrogen is then circulated at the 
operating pressure of the process and at 1750C.  
• Feed containing 1–2% sulfur is circulated and the temperature is in-
creased to 200–2500C to start the sulﬁding process.  
• Some of the sulfur in the feed is incorporated into the catalyst as metal 
sulfides. The level of sulfur in the feed leaving the catalyst bed reaches a 
constant level when this stage has come to quasi-equilibrium. The tem-
perature is then increased to 3000C and the process repeated, giving fur-
ther sulfiding of the catalyst. Normal operation can be started after this 
stage.  
Presulﬁding normally takes 10–20 h to complete. Sulfur uptake depends on 
the metal oxide content of the catalyst used but is normally in the range 7–10%. 
Good gas distribution through the catalyst bed is very important to sulﬁde even-
ly all of the catalyst. Pre-sulfurised catalysts were introduced to avoid problems 
associated with poor gas distribution and temperature control. They also had the 
added bonus of a quicker and simpler start-up procedure. The early pre-
sulfurised catalysts were prepared by treating green catalyst with elemental sul-
fur to fill the pores within the catalyst particle. The active sulﬁdes were formed 
subsequently, when the catalyst was heated in a stream of hydrogen in the reac-
tor. This procedure led to a signiﬁcant temperature rise during start-up, which 
resulted in the vaporization and subsequent deposition of sulfur in downstream 
equipment.  
Improved pre-sulfurised catalysts containing polysulﬁdes or metal oxysul-
ﬁdes were later developed to overcome these problems.24 Polysulﬁdes still react 
rapidly with hydrogen during conversion of the cobalt, nickel, and molybdenum 
oxides to sulﬁdes and produce a temperature rise in the catalyst bed. On the oth-
er hand, metal oxysulﬁdes react slowly over a much wider temperature range 
and do not produce an exotherm.  
Presulfurized catalysts can be commissioned satisfactorily with a ﬂow of 
hydrogen in the temperature range 150–3000C. There is no signiﬁcant tempera-
ture rise in the catalyst bed and water evolves gradually between 200–3000C.

6.4.2.4. Catalyst Operation  
 
The early processes used to hydrotreat naphthas only required single beds, but 
modern plants treating heavier feeds are more complicated. Several catalyst beds 
with a variety of catalysts are usually required.25 Interbed cooling with cold gas 
quench or liquid feed may also be necessary. Hydrotreating reactions are exo-
thermic and cooling is essential to avoid catalyst damage.  
Different catalysts are used in separate beds, because several different reac-
tions are taking place at the same time. Top beds operate as guards that remove 
metals from vacuum gas oils and residues, as well as promoting sulfur and ni-
trogen removal reactions. Guard catalysts consist of large particles which have 
large pores to absorb metal porphyrins and Conradson carbon. The large particle 
size is needed to limit any increase in pressure drop caused by trapped impuri-
ties. There is usually an improvement in hydrotreating performance if the mo-
lybdenum and nickel content of these catalysts are high. Pressure drop is still the 
most signiﬁcant operating problem.  
A selection of the different sulfurous and nitrogenous impurities in a typical 
feed and the reaction sequences involved in their removal is shown in Table 
6.11.  
Coke is gradually deposited onto the catalyst surface during operation, even 
when using naphtha and middle distillates as feed, and this leads to a reduction 
in catalyst activity and an increase in pressure drop throughout the reactor. The 
plant may need to be shut down for catalyst regeneration to restore activity and 
to reduce pressure drop. Some liquid feeds do not vaporize completelyunder 
operating conditions and uneven liquid distribution through the beds also leads 
to poor performance.  
 
6.4.2.5. Catalyst Regeneration  
 
A typical procedure to regenerate a hydrotreating catalyst in the reactor is as 
follows:  
• Isolate feed to the reactor and purge all volatile organic material from the 
catalyst with hydrogen.  
• Purge hydrogen from the reactor with steam and increase temperature to 
3500C.  
• Add air to the steam, keeping the maximum bed temperature to 400
◦C. 
There is a localized hot zone passing through the bed as the residual car-
bon is burnt to carbon dioxide, and as the hot spot passes through the bed, 
increase the temperature to 4500C.  
• Maintain temperature at 4500C until no carbon dioxide is detected at the 
bed outlet and then purge residual oxygen from the reactor with steam.

The catalyst can be reused following regeneration provided that it has not 
been deactivated by metals such as vanadium, nickel, sodium from the feed or 
iron scale. Deactivated catalysts can contain between 10 and 30% of metal de-
posits, which may be recovered for economic or environmental reasons. Oxida-
tion of cobalt or nickel sulﬁdes to sulfate, during in situ regeneration, can gradu-
ally lead to deactivation of the catalyst.

With the large volumes of catalyst now used it has become usual to regen-
erate catalyst externally in special rotary kilns to save time and energy.26 
In situ 
regeneration can often take up to 20 days. External regeneration can be quicker 
and gives better temperature control and gas circulation, so that regenerated cat-
alyst can be cleaner and almost as active as new catalyst. At the same time, dis-
charged catalyst can be separated into cobalt or nickel types and different sized 
particles.  
Apart from the possible need to hold a spare catalyst charge, external regen-
eration is more economic. However, as most reﬁneries operate several hy-
drotreating units, it is usual to cycle regenerated catalysts from the less severe 
naphtha hydrotreating to middle distillate and ﬁnally to residue treatments.  
External regeneration in the rotary kiln requires two stages:  
• Sulfur is removed from the catalyst at 200–2500C by gentle oxidation of 
sulﬁdes to sulfur dioxide in a ﬂow of air. Temperature control is im-
portant to avoid complete oxidation of sulﬁde to sulfate at high tempera-
tures.  
• Carbon can then be oxidized in air at 4000C, taking care to limit the oxy-
gen content of the hot gas and avoid temperature runaway, which would 
deactivate catalyst.  
The operating cycle time before regeneration is needed varies considerably 
depending on the quality of the feed being used, as shown in Table 6.9. The type 
and size of catalyst is also important. For example, a naphtha hydrotreater can 
probably operate for at least two years before regeneration, whereas diesel oil 
and residue hydrotreaters only operate for a maximum of about 350 and 250 
days, respectively.  
6.5. HYDROCRACKING  
Hydrocracking is a process for the conversion of heavy gas oils, including low-
value fractions not suitable for catalytic cracking, into light gases, gasoline, jet 
fuel, and diesel oil. The process operates at a high hydrogen pressure (60–200 
atm) and moderate temperatures in the range 350–4500C. Dual-function cata-
lysts are used to combine the hydrogenation activity of hydrotreating catalysts 
with an acidic cracking support.  
The process was introduced in modern reﬁneries by the Union Oil Company 
(Unocal) in 1964,27 but dates back to the 1920s when coal hydrogenation pro-
cesses were developed in Germany and the United Kingdom. Gas oil was hy-
drocracked by Standard Oil at their Baton Rouge Reﬁnery, during the 1930s 
using the German catalysts. The process produced aviation gasoline during 
World War II in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  
232 
Chapter 6 
The nickel catalysts supported on silica/alumina introduced by Chevron28 in 
the low-temperature isocracking process in 1959 were used to upgrade distillates 
and to produce low-molecular-weight isoparafﬁns for high-octane gasoline. 
When the Union Oil Company used a more acidic zeolite support in 1964 the 
process became more versatile and a wider range of high-boiling-point feeds 
including middle distillates could be converted to high-quality products.29 
Or-
ganic nitrogen and sulfur compounds present in these feeds were also hydrogen-
ated, forming ammonia and hydrogen sulﬁde, and removed from the products. 
Since the 1970s there has been a continuous improvement to the process and 
catalysts, as lower-quality feeds have been upgraded.  
 
6.5.1.  Hydrocracking Processes  
 
Low-value distillates, including heavy-cycle oils from FCC units, thermal and 
coker gas oils, and other heavy-vacuum gas oils, are cracked to produce naph-
tha, jet fuel, and diesel oils. The reaction mechanism is the same as in catalytic 
cracking and some aromatic products are also hydrogenated.  
There are two steps in the hydrocracking process. Following hydrotreatment 
to remove organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds, the feed is cracked. The main 
hydrocracking reactions in the second step which proceed via a carbenium ion 
mechanism are as follows:  
• Dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins; isomerization and cracking of 
the resulting oleﬁns at the third carbon atom; hydrogenation of oleﬁns to 
isoparaffins.  
• Stepwise ring hydrogenation and hydrocracking of polycyclic aromatics. 
• Dealkylation of alkyl aromatics and naphthenes.  
• Saturation and cracking of aromatics.  
• Hydrogenation of coke precursors formed during the hydrocracking reac-
tions.  
The proportion of different products formed depends on the catalysts used. 
Weak hydrogenation catalysts with a strongly acid support produce low-boiling 
gasoline with a high iso-to-normal paraffin ratio. Catalysts with high hydrogena-
tion activity and low support acidity provide middle distillates. The hydrogen 
added for the hydrogenation reactions suppresses coke formation, which would 
quickly deactivate the catalyst. Catalysts operate for 2–6 years before being re-
generated or replaced.  
Feed and hydrogen are circulated through the catalyst at the conditions se-
lected for the range of products required. Reaction temperatures in the range 
250–5000C and pressures in the range 60–200 atm have been used. Hydrotreat-
ing and hydrocracking reactions are exothermic and the catalyst is loaded into 
several beds so that temperature can be controlled by the addition of a cold hy-
drogen  quench.  Several different  process  designs  have been used since  1959.

These can be divided into two different groups,27 and details are given in Table 
6.12. 
 
6.5.1.1. Single-Stage Processes  
 
In the early hydrocrackers, the feed was hydrotreated in a separate unit to re-
move organic nitrogen compounds, which are catalyst poisons. A nick-
el/tungsten/silica/ alumina hydrocracking catalyst was then used in a single ves-
sel operating in the range 350–4500C. Conversion was in the range 40–70%, and 
unconverted feed was recirculated after fractionation. These units operate with 
relatively low levels of impurity in the feed, but recycle gas contains hydrogen 
sulﬁde. However, early units still operating now use the new zeolite-based cata-
lysts to treat higher-boiling feeds.  
234 
Chapter 6 
Design was improved by combining the two stages. Feed from the hy-
drotreating catalyst passed directly to the hydrocracking catalyst for conversion 
and unconverted feed was recycled back to the hydrocracking section. Hy-
drotreating and hydrocracking catalysts were used so both feed and hydrogen 
passed directly from one reactor to the other. This meant that after hydrotreat-
ment, the hydrogen still contained ammonia and hydrogen sulﬁde when it en-
tered the hydrocracker. This was usually acceptable because ammonia did not 
poison the zeolite-based catalysts being used at the time.  
 
6.5.1.2. Two-Stage Processes  
 
In two-stage processes mainly hydrotreating and some cracking takes place in 
the ﬁrst reactor at 350–4250C. The cracked products are then fractionated before 
the unconverted feed passes to the second reactor which contains hydrocracking 
catalyst. Recycled gas is also scrubbed to remove ammonia and hydrogen sulﬁde 
if palladium-based hydrocracking catalysts are used in the second reactor. Nick-
el molybdate or tungstate catalysts must be sulﬁded before use, so there is no 
need to remove hydrogen sulﬁde from recycle hydrogen. Hydrocracking cata-
lysts can operate with or without sulfur at 260–3750C. Feeds with high nitrogen 
content can therefore be hydrocracked at a lower second-stage temperature and 
higher space velocity than in single-stage processes.  
By using a high-activity hydrotreating catalyst in the ﬁrst reactor, with a ze-
olite catalyst in the second, overall conversion can be increased to 50–80%. Un-
converted feed is still recycled, but a purge of about 5–10% may be needed to 
remove accumulated polynuclear aromatics from the circulating feed. These can 
cause deactivation of the catalyst, and foul the reactors. Typical compounds in-
clude coronene (seven fused rings) and ovalene (ten fused rings), both of which 
are not very soluble. They are brightly colored and have been called the red 
death!30 
 
6.5.1.3. Once-Through Process  
 
 
More recently a very ﬂexible hydrocracking process has been operated, based on 
the single-stage process.27 Conversion of the feed can range between 40–90%, 
but unconverted feed is not recycled. Feeds including heavy-vacuum gas oils, 
heavy-cycle oil, coker gas oil, and deasphalted oil are cracked to produce high-
quality middle distillates and naphtha for catalytic reformers. Residue from the 
fractionator is used as catalytic cracker and ethylene plant feed, lube oil stocks, 
or high-quality fuel oil. Organic nitrogen is almost completely removed from the 
product and sulfur content is very low. Moderately active zeolite catalysts are 
used.

6.5.2. Hydrocracking Catalysts  
 
It is important that hydrocracking catalysts have both high cracking and hy-
drogenation activities. Typical catalysts are generally made with an acid support 
containing either nickel/tungstate or palladium as the hydrogenation catalyst. 
Typical examples are shown in Table 6.13. All nickel/molybdate and nick-
el/tungstate catalysts can only work effectively in the form of sulﬁdes in hy-
drotreating and hydrocracking reactions. For this reason the hydrogen sulﬁde 
content of recycle hydrogen must be controlled at an appropriate level. Ammo-
nia is normally scrubbed from recycle gas.  
 
6.5.2.1. Acid Supports  
 
The ﬁrst acid support to be used in hydrocracking catalysts was an amorphous 
silica/alumina, but following the successful application of zeolites in catalytic 
cracking processes in 1964, this has generally been replaced by Y-zeolite. The 
most important feature of the support, apart from the high acidity needed to 
crack high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, is high thermal stability to with-
stand the process conditions. Pore size is not as critical when using heavy feed 
for hydrocracking as is the case for hydrotreating, provided that the surface area 
is sufﬁciently high. Many different support formulations have been patented, 
with many of them similar to FCC catalysts. All are produced as extrudates, held 
together with binders such as peptized alumina.

Chapter 6 
Zeolites, often combined with amorphous alumina or silica/alumina and a 
suitable binder, are now the most widely used acidic component to hydrocrack 
heavy feeds. Hydrogen-exchanged and dealuminated Y-zeolites are normally 
preferred. Zeolites are more active than amorphous materials because of their 
uniform and acidic structure. Less coke is formed during operation, resulting in 
less deactivation of the catalyst so that operational life can be longer than six 
years. With nitrogen-free feed the zeolite is active at lower operating tempera-
tures and heavier feeds can be cracked.  
Modification of the silica/alumina ratio of the Y-zeolite used in catalytic 
cracking catalysts can also improve its hydrocracking performance. It was found 
that dealuminated Y-zeolites give high diesel selectivity, whereas untreated Y-
zeolite provides a hydrocracking catalyst with high selectivity for gasoline.  
A hydrocracking catalyst support can therefore be tailor-made depending on 
how the catalyst is to be operated and the product type needed. To obtain maxi-
mum conversion to gasoline at the lowest operating temperature, up to 80% Y-
zeolite and about 20% of a peptized alumina binder is used as support. High 
middle-distillate conversion is obtained at higher operating temperatures with a 
support containing about 10% dealuminated Y-zeolite, 70% alumina or sili-
ca/alumina in varying proportions, and 20% of the binder. The appropriate Y-
zeolite and the proportion to be used in the catalyst can be selected for the prod-
ucts, as required.  
 
6.5.2.2. Hydrogenation Catalysts  
 
Sulﬁded nickel/molybdate catalysts supported on a suitable γ-alumina are used 
for ﬁrst-stage hydrocracking reactions and they have a higher nickel molybdate 
content than typical hydrotreating catalysts. Sulﬁded nickel/tungstate or palladi-
um, supported on zeolite or silica/alumina, is used in the second hydrocracking 
stage. Palladium catalysts are active if the feed contains residual sulfur com-
pounds but are not active for the hydrogenation of benzene rings. Hydrogen sul-
fide need not, therefore, be removed from the recirculating hydrogen unless it is 
necessary to remove all aromatics.  
 
6.5.2.3. Catalyst Preparation  
 
Nickel/molybdate hydrocracking catalysts are made by impregnating preformed 
supports with solutions of nickel and molybdenum salts.31,32 The addition of 
ammonia or phosphoric acid to the solutions before impregnation is claimed to 
simplify the procedure and to improve activity of the catalyst.  
Palladium catalysts are made by ion exchanging the zeolite with a solution 
of palladium chloride containing ammonia followed by careful washing and 
drying.31,32 The tetramine complex can be decomposed in air at temperatures 
above 8000C to produce palladium metal in the form of ﬁnely divided crystal-

lites. Direct reduction with hydrogen can lead to agglomeration of the palladium 
crystals, which are inactive. The zeolite is extruded with a binder and any other 
necessary component of the support.  
 
6.5.2.4. Catalyst Activity  
 
Catalysts are activated before use. Nickel catalysts are carefully presulﬁded ei-
ther before or after loading to the reactor with the same organic sulfur com-
pounds and procedures used for hydrotreating catalysts. Palladium catalysts are 
briefly activated in hydrogen at about 3500C, taking care not to overheat the bed, 
so that the crystallites do not sinter.  
Silica/alumina hydrocracking catalysts are severely poisoned by ammonia. 
The feed must therefore be hydrotreated and hydrogen recycle must be scrubbed 
to eliminate as much organic nitrogen and ammonia as possible. Zeolites are 
slightly less affected by typical ammonia levels and are widely used in the more 
efﬁcient two-reactor single-stage process.27 
Catalysts should, however, contain 
more zeolite if the ammonia content is variable. The active metal content must 
also be increased to achieve the same conversion in the presence of ammonia. 
The cracking activity of the support and the hydrogenation activity of the metal 
component must therefore be carefully optimized to obtain maximum conver-
sion with different operating conditions and feeds.  
 
6.5.2.5. Catalyst Reactivation  
 
A typical catalyst can operate for a number of years, and any slow loss of activi-
ty can be compensated for by a gradual increase in process operating tempera-
ture until the reactor temperature limit is reached. Regeneration is then possible, 
either in the reactor or externally, by burning accumulated coke in dilute air. 
This restores the activity of most nickel/molybdate or nickel/tungstate catalysts, 
which must then be resulﬁded before further use.  
Deactivated palladium supported on zeolite can also be regenerated, and the 
catalyst must also be reactivated before being reused. This is because palladium 
in the zeolite framework sinters. By treating the catalyst with an excess of am-
monium hydroxide solution, however, the agglomerated palladium dissolves to 
form a tetramine complex. Calcination in air then decomposes the complex and 
the original palladium distribution and activity are restored.31 
 
The ﬁrst Y-zeolite hydrocracking catalysts contained residual sodium ions 
in the sodalite cages that were mobile during operation and they entered the su-
percage. This led to a loss of cracking activity. Treatment of the zeolite with an 
ammonium salt solution removed the mobile sodium ions and restored acidity. 
The redistribution of palladium with ammonia solution could be combined with 
an exchange of sodium ions to rejuvenate the catalyst in one step.32 This was 
done before reactivation by burning off the carbon deposits.

6.6. CATALYTIC REFORMING  
Catalytic reforming is a key reﬁnery process. It improves the octane rating of 
virgin naphthas and light distillates so they can be used in gasoline formulations. 
The process has also become an important source of aromatics for use in petro-
chemical production.33  
Low-octane, sulfur-and nitrogen-free parafﬁns and naphthas in the boiling 
range 80–1600C are converted to higher octane iso-parafﬁns and aromatic com-
pounds by a sequence of dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclisation and isomerization 
reactions. Hydrocracking reactions are less important, but can also convert the 
higher-molecular-weight paraffins to more useful products, but with a reduction 
in the yield of C5
+ 
products. 
When gasoline is the main product required, it is usual to remove the C5–C6 
straight-run naphtha cut before reforming the 100–1600C fraction. This is be-
cause separate isomerization of the C5–C6 paraffins (Section 6.10) gives an 
overall improvement in octane number. If aromatics are required, a lower-
boiling fraction, in the range 80–1200C, is reformed. The heavy naphthas are not 
reformed because coke forms more readily and quickly leads to deactivation of 
the catalyst.  
The ﬁrst naphtha-reforming catalysts were used during World War II in a 
process known as hydroforming and were based on molybdenum or chromium 
oxides supported on alumina.34 At the time, the new process provided high-
octane aviation fuel and the toluene needed for the production of explosives. 
The decreased demand for these products after the war meant that the seven op-
erating plants were idle by 1952. In any case the preferred catalyst (9% 
MoO3/alumina) was neither active enough nor selective enough to give a really 
economic performance and needed frequent regeneration. Vladimir Haensel, 
who invented the platinum reforming catalyst,35 recalled that during and after the 
wartime period, UOP was investigating a hydrocracking process that used desul-
furized kerosene as feed. The work involved an analytical procedure for six-
membered rings, based on the catalytic dehydrogenation of naphthenes with 3% 
platinum supported on carbon. Haensel tells how this led to the treatment of 
virgin naphthas containing sulfur with a similar platinum catalyst supported on 
silica. Operation at up to 4500C and 500 psig, with 5 mol of hydrogen recycle 
per mole of feed, showed not only that the virgin straight-run naphthas were 
reformed to give a high-octane gasoline product but that sulfur poisoning was 
avoided. At the same time, however, the silica support and others such as sili-
ca/alumina promoted hydrocracking reactions. Further investigations produced 
an economic platinum/alumina catalyst with a platinum content in the range 0.3–
0.7%.36 The catalyst proved to be particularly effective when the alumina was 
prepared from aluminum chloride rather than the nitrate. This led to the treat-
ment of supports with chloride or fluoride to improve acidity—a practice that 
has continued ever since. The new UOP process was announced at the Western

6.6.1.  Naphtha Reforming Reactions  
 
The principal reforming reactions are shown in Table 6.14. The isomerization of 
n-paraffins proceeds via a dehydrogenation step on the platinum component of 
the catalyst to an n-oleﬁn intermediate. The n-oleﬁn then migrates to the acidic 
alumina site and isomerizes to the iso-oleﬁn. Finally the iso-olefin is hydrogen-
ated to the isoparaffin by the platinum. This mechanism requires good disper-
sion of platinum on the highly acidic, chloride-treated alumina support.  
Similar mechanisms apply to the isomerization and dehydrocyclization of n-
hexane to methyl cyclopentane and then benzene, as shown in Table 6.15.  
 
6.6.1.1. Reformer Operation  
 
The combined sequence reforming reaction is endothermic, and there is a 
signiﬁcant temperature decrease across the catalyst bed. Heat has to be supplied 
continuously to maintain operation, so catalyst is loaded into a number of beds 
or reactors with interbed heating of the reaction mixture. The process is compli-
cated because of the different reactions and temperature changes taking place in 
each bed. Variable heat balances were compensated in early plants by loading 
increasing volumes of catalyst in each bed from the top to the bottom of each 
reactor. An alternative arrangement was to load several reactors with equal vol-
umes of catalyst while having a similar reactor in reserve to replace any operat-
ing reactor needing regeneration.  
Three different reactor systems have evolved since the process was ﬁrst in-
troduced in 1952:

Chapter 6 
• The semi-regenerative process operates continuously over long periods of 
up to 9–12 months. There are usually three reactors in series that contain 
about 15–20%, 30–35%, and 50–60% respectively of the catalyst’s 
charge, depending on the feed used. Operation is in the range 10–25 atm 
for different feeds and reforming severity. When the catalyst activity has 
decreased, resulting in lower liquid yields and more hydrocracking activi-
ty, the catalyst is regenerated in situ, using air at about 8 atm. The catalyst 
can usually be regenerated up to ten times before the performance be-
comes uneconomic and it has to be replaced. Reaction conditions are 
summarized in Table 6.16.  
• Cyclic processes generally operate with four reactors although as many as 
six are used if frequent regeneration is necessary.  All reactors contain 
equal volumes of catalyst and operate at about 4800C and 20 atm, with a 
temperature decrease of 250–300C across each bed.  Low hydrogen/feed 
ratios can be used. One reactor is kept in reserve so that it can be 
switched to replace any on-line reactor requiring regeneration, so giving 
continuous operation. Cyclic processes operate at low pressure to give 
high yields of a high-octane product, but with relatively high coke lay-
down. The interval between switching reactors to regenerate the catalyst 
can be rather short, for example, after processing only about eight barrels 
of feed per pound of catalyst used, with catalyst regeneration either daily 
or perhaps after only a few days. This complicates the process engineer-
ing because alternating hydrogen and oxygen streams have to be provid-
ed. Catalyst life is also relatively short as a result of the frequent regener-
ationneeded and can be less than about 200 barrels of feed per pound of 
catalyst.  
• Contin uous catalyst regeneration (CCR) processes were introduced in 
1971 to avoid the shut-down intervals necessary in semi-regenerative re-
formers. The reformers have four beds, either stacked vertically or placed 
side by side horizontally, so that the catalyst can be moved continuously 
from one catalyst bed to another and ultimately, into the regenerator (Fig. 
6.5). After regeneration, the catalyst is reduced before being returned to 
the ﬁrst reactor to begin the sequence again. The average residence time 
of a catalyst in a CCR unit has decreased since the process was ﬁrst intro-
duced. The ﬁrst design in 1971 recycled the catalyst charge about 12 
times a year. By 1980 the recycle rate was 50 times a year, but as operat-
ing conditions have become even more severe, the rate can now be as 
high as 150 times a year.40 Despite this, the catalysts used have lasted for 
more than seven years. Operating conditions are shown in Table 6.17.

The CCR process has been very successful and is now used extensively 
throughout the world. The main advantage is that the coke content of catalyst 
before regeneration is as low as 5–6%, despite the severe operating conditions at 
hydrogen pressure as low as 3 atm. Yields of high-octane product and hydrogen 
were significantly increased. Old catalyst can also be withdrawn from the reac-
tor and replaced with fresh catalyst when activity declines. High yields are fa-
vored by low pressure and low hydrogen circulation, but more coke is formed. 
Despite the higher capital cost of CCR reformers the higher yields and more 
flexible operation make the process very popular.  
By the late 1990s more than 900 reformers were operating throughout the 
world.41 The semi-regenerative process was being used in 60–70% of them, with 
continuous regeneration processes being used in 15–20%.42 Cyclic processes 
were only used in about 10–15% of the reformers. Since 1990, however, almost 
all of the new reformers being built or designed use the continuous regeneration 
process. As larger-capacity reformers have been built, axial ﬂow through the 
catalyst beds has been replaced by radial ﬂow because this configuration allows 
for better gas distribution and reduced pressure drop.  
Catalyst operation in the catalytic reforming process is influenced by feed 
composition, hydrogen ratio, and operating conditions. The beneﬁts obtained by 
any changes in design always have to be balanced with certain disadvantages. 
For example, although straight-run naphthas boiling at up to about 2000C can be 
used in catalytic reforming processes, the use of lower-boiling naphthas gives 
better results. More coke forms on the catalyst as high-molecular-weight hydro-
carbons are reformed, and it is estimated that above 1900C every 130C increase 
in the boiling range of the naphtha can reduce the period before regeneration by 
35%.  
Sulfur impurities in naphtha poison platinum hydrogenation activity and ni-
trogen impurities neutralize acid sites. Both poisons have to be carefully re-
moved before the naphtha can be used. Despite this need to remove sulfur com-
pounds from reformer feeds, it is also necessary to selectively poison the active 
platinum in new or regenerated catalysts by adding about 0.25% of sulfur to the 
catalyst in a sulﬁding procedure using 100–200 ppm H2S in the feed. This limits 
the extent to which the exothermic hydrogenolysis reactions that deposit coke 
and lead to sintered catalyst can occur. Without this sulfur conditioning, the 
yield of product can be reduced by 1% and the run length reduced by up to 15–
20%. Unlike chloride, sulfur should not be added continuously during operation 
and the normal sulfur speciﬁcation of naphtha must be applied.  
Since the ﬁrst catalytic reformers were used in the 1950s the hydrogen/ hy-
drocarbon mole ratio and the reformer operating pressure have both been gradu-
ally decreased. These developments resulted from improvements in the alumina 
support, the use of bimetallic catalysts, and ﬁnally the introduction of the low-
pressure, continuous catalyst regeneration processes. The trends in operation are 
shown in Table 6.18.  
246 
Chapter 6 
TABLE 6.18. Trends in Reformer Severity. 
 
 
These changes have resulted in improved operation, not only by reducing 
gas compression costs, but also by increasing gasoline yields and hydrogen pro-
duction from the dehydrogenation reactions, in combination with a lower degree 
of the hydrocracking reaction. Unfortunately, some hydrogen is lost because it 
also reacts (beneﬁcially) with coke precursors, so removing them and decreasing 
the rate of coke deposition. The use of low hydrogen pressure slows down this 
reaction, and ultimately leads to more coke deposition and the need for more 
frequent regeneration. It is necessary, therefore, to balance the advantage of 
higher yields against increased catalyst deactivation in processes that allow con-
tinuous catalyst regeneration. Modern catalytic reformers operate at liquid hour-
ly space velocity in the range 1.0–2.0 h-1. The lower limit is a compromise be-
tween an increase in undesirable hydrocracking and a decrease in beneﬁcial de-
hydrocyclization reactions. These conditions have no effect on either dehydro-
genation or isomerization reactions, which still reach equilibrium. The inlet 
temperature to the catalyst bed must be increased as the catalyst is either deac-
tivated or if a higher octane product is required. Operating temperatures also 
depends on the feed composition, hydrogen ratio, and the need to control the 
temperature decrease in all beds. Typical temperatures are shown in Tables 6.16 
and 6.17.  
An essential requirement of reformer operation is the addition of chlorine 
compounds to the feed to maintain the necessary chlorine content and hence the 
acidity of the alumina support. This requires a careful monitoring of the mass 
balance of chloride entering and leaving the catalyst beds, to maintain the chlo-
ride content of the catalyst at about 1.0 wt%. A strict control of water in the feed 
is also required to minimize chloride loss.  
 
6.6.1.2. Coke Formation  
 
Hydrogenolysis reactions cause the formation of coke precursors on the active 
platinum surface, which can then diffuse to adjacent acid sites on the alumina 
support. A series of polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions form coke, 
which eventually covers the catalyst surface and reduces activity. Early experi-
ence showed that traces of sulfur in the catalyst during start-up reduced coking 
by inhibiting the excessive hydrogenolysis reaction and the interval before re-
generation became necessary could be increased. Acid catalyzed cracking reac-

tions were not affected, however, and some coke was still formed. No sulfur 
addition is required during normal operation because it shortens the cycle time.  
The interval between regenerations can be extended by increasing hydrogen 
recycle and raising operating pressure from 15 to 35 atm. This improves the rate 
at which coke precursors are hydrogenated on the platinum surface, but these 
changes decrease yields and octane ratings (see Section 6.6.1.1).  
 
6.6.2.  Reforming Catalysts  
 
Platinum was not only the most active and selective Group-VIII metal for the 
naphtha reforming process, but was also more readily available and relatively 
less expensive than iridium or rhodium.  
Both γ- and η-aluminas were suitable as the acidic support. Although η-
alumina is more acidic and has a higher isomerization activity, it is more expen-
sive to produce and not much better than a stable γ-alumina to which chloride 
has been added during its preparation. The composition of typical reforming 
catalysts is shown in Table 6.19. Fluorided-alumina and silica/alumina supports 
were both used in some early reformers but were not really successful because 
of excess acidity, which promoted cracking reactions.  
The success of platforming soon led to the rapid introduction of competitive 
processes as demand for higher-octane gasoline for high-compression automo-
bile engines increased. Seven process licensors are still offering reforming pro-
cesses differing only in the physical appearance of the unit and the catalysts 
used.42More than 50 different catalyst types are currently being supplied by at 
least ten catalyst producers. As usual with licensed processes, full details of 
catalyst compositions and operation are not described in detail.

6.6.2.1. Bimetallic Catalysts  
 
During the 1950s and 1960s the performance of platinum reforming catalysts 
was considerably improved as operating procedures were optimized. More eco-
nomic catalysts became available as the platinum content was reduced from 
more than 0.6 wt% to about 0.35 wt% and the sulfur content of feed naphtha 
was considerably reduced. Higher purity alumina supports, with better activity 
and lower levels of sodium and iron could be synthesized reproducibly. An op-
timum amount of chloride added to the support limited coke formation.  
 
More signiﬁcant changes, however, began in 1968 when Chevron intro-
duced its bimetallic catalyst containing platinum and rhenium. The main ad-
vantage of the new catalyst was its relative stability, which extended operation 
before regeneration was necessary. The separation of small platinum crystallites 
by rhenium made the catalyst less sensitive to carbon deposition. In fact, bime-
tallic catalysts doubled the period before regeneration was necessary. This im-
provement allowed operation at lower pressures with increased yields. Improved 
dehydrocyclization and isomerization selectivity also increased the volume of 
aromatics produced and the octane number of the gasoline. The level of hy-
drocracking decreased and the production of light gases was reduced.  
The success of the platinum/rhenium catalyst was evident, as more than 
80% of all catalyst replacement charges were bimetallic by 1972. By then 30% 
of all reformers were using the rhenium catalyst.43 Acceptance continued in all 
reforming processes so that more than two-thirds of installed catalyst capacity 
was bimetallic by 1979.44 Catalyst improvements also continued during this pe-
riod, and the original Chevron catalyst, Grade A, was replaced several times up 
to Grade F.44  
Most of the changes were probably related to metals concentration but the 
original bimetallic catalyst contained equal weight percentages of platinum and 
rhenium and is now known as a balanced catalyst. Since the late 1980s, rhenium 
catalysts have contained about twice as much rhenium as platinum and are 
known as skewed catalysts. The skewed catalysts are even more stable, particu-
larly when loaded to reactors at high bulk density, and have extended the operat-
ing cycle even further before regeneration is required. This is partly due to the 
ability of the catalyst to operate with increased coke content.  
A disadvantage of platinum/rhenium catalysts is their sensitivity to sulfur 
poisoning. This requires that naphtha feed must be carefully hydrotreated before 
use.  
The very few plants still using platinum catalysts (with no rhenium) are 
those without the necessary hydrotreating facilities.  
It is necessary to pre-sulﬁde new or regenerated catalysts with a suitable 
sulfur compound prior to use when working with a low sulfur-content feed, to 
reduce excessive hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst. Presulﬁding causes 
deactivation of the super-active edges on the metal sites that are responsible for 
 
Refinery Catalysts  
249 
the bulk of the hydrogenolysis activity which would otherwise lead to premature 
coke formation and the hot spots that cause a reduction in reforming activity. 
The addition of 100–200 ppm of dimethyl sulﬁde to the recirculating gas raises 
the sulfur level of the catalyst to about 0.25% by weight. During subsequent 
operation, only the sulfur on the superactive edges remains in the catalyst, the 
rest being quickly removed. Subsequent operation of the catalyst is not affected 
and the presence of rhenium sulﬁdes may limit the sintering of the platinum 
crystallites.  
The information in Table 6.20 shows how the use of rhenium has improved 
operation and indicates the coke content before regeneration is necessary. The 
coke content shown is for the third bed in a semi-regenerative unit (the ﬁrst and 
second beds contain considerably less coke.) It has been found that even 1 ppm 
of sulfur in the naphtha feed reduces the cycle time with skewed and balanced 
catalysts by about 25% and 35%, respectively.45  
The ﬁrst CCR unit in 1971 used a platinum/rhenium catalyst, but in 1973 
UOP introduced a catalyst in which the platinum was promoted by tin.39 The 
new catalyst not only resulted in lower coke levels at the low operating pressure 
but was easily regenerated throughout its long life. Tin reacts with the surface 
hydroxyl groups on the γ-alumina support. This gives better stability and in-
creases the amount of coke deposited on the support rather than on the platinum. 
Satisfactory operation, however, depends on a good distribution of both plati-
num and tin. γ-Alumina is stabilized by the tin, which reacts with the surface 
hydroxyl groups. The first UOP catalytic reformer plant at 1000 tonnes per ca-
pacity is shown in Figure 6.6. 
Iridium has also been used as a promoter in platinum reforming catalysts 
since it was introduced by Exxon in 1971–1972.38 This was reported by Chemi-
cal Week in one of their Catalyst Reviews, when they noted a sharp increase in 
the reported sales of iridium.46 Catalysts containing iridium have not been wide-
ly used except in plants designed by Exxon and Amoco. Extremely long periods 
between regenerations have been reported and may be due to the more efﬁcient

groups with chloride gives neighboring hydroxyl groups increased acidity with-
out increasing the total number of acid sites.  
Impregnated alumina is carefully drained and dried at about 1500C to re-
move residual water and then oxidized in dry air at about 5000C. Drying and 
oxidation can replace some of the chlorine atoms from the adsorbed chloroplati-
nate ions on active sites with oxygen. At the same time, the chloride content of 
the alumina is decreased depending on the partial pressure of water vapor pre-
sent in the air stream. Loss of chloride should, therefore, be carefully controlled 
by ensuring a low drying temperature and using dried air during oxidation to 
maintain the required chlorine content in the finished catalyst. The properties of 
the γ-alumina support are extremely important and the gradual improvements 
made to the catalytic reforming process up to about 1960 came mainly from an 
understanding of the catalyst properties and the use of purer, more stable alumi-
nas.  
Bimetallic catalysts have the same basic characteristics as the platinum/γ-
alumina catalysts, with good dispersion of small platinum crystallites. The most 
widely used bimetallic catalysts are the platinum/rhenium formulations. The 
preparation of these catalysts is usually by impregnation of the γ-alumina sup-
port with a solution of chloroplatinic acid and perrhenic acid, or its ammonium 
salt in hydrochloric acid.47 Successive impregnations with chloroplatinic and 
perrhenic acid solutions have also been used. The catalysts are then carefully 
dried, oxidized, and reduced. The volatility of the rhenium complexes or oxides 
requires careful control of temperature to avoid metal loss by vaporisation and to 
prevent alloy formation during reduction.  
Platinum/iridium catalysts are made by impregnating γ-alumina with chlo-
roplatinic and chloroiridic acids. Heating to temperatures about 3750C produces 
the highly dispersed bimetallic clusters that form the catalyst. Great care is re-
quired to achieve the necessary metal dispersion because iridium oxide is vola-
tile, and it has even been suggested that a third metal such as chromium is re-
quired to promote support-metal interaction.  
Platinum/tin catalysts are made by impregnating the support with tin chlo-
ride and calcining at 5000C, before impregnation with chloroplatinic acid. The 
catalyst is then dried, oxidized, and reduced. Temperature control is necessary to 
avoid reduction of the tin chloride to metallic tin, which would then alloy with 
the platinum. Tin oxide combines with acid sites on the support and increases 
resistance to deactivation. Typical catalyst formulations are shown in Table 
6.19.  
 
6.6.3.  Catalyst Regeneration  
 
When the yield from the reformer falls to an uneconomic level the catalyst must 
be regenerated.48 This is the point where the C5
+ 
yield falls from the initial 76–
77% to about 73% and the purity of recovered hydrogen declines. Regeneration 
252 
Chapter 6 
removes the coke deposited on the active sites, restores the catalyst acidity, and 
redisperses the active metal into smaller crystallites. Different quantities of coke 
are deposited in each bed of a semi-regenerative reformer. Beds 1, 2, and 3 con-
tain about 1–3 wt%, 5–15 wt%, and 8–20 wt%, respectively. Great care must be 
taken to maintain a steady temperature proﬁle in each bed during the regenera-
tion procedure.  
Catalyst is regenerated in the continuous catalytic reduction process using 
the same basic procedures. About 200 lb h-1 were reduced in the ﬁrst CCR units 
in 1971 compared with 4000 lb h-1 
in modern plants. These quantities are 
equivalent to regenerating the whole charge of catalyst in the reformer—a total 
of 12 and 150 times a year, respectively.  
 
6.6.3.1. Carbon Burn  
 
Coke is removed by burning in an air/nitrogen gas stream, containing up to 0.5 
vol% of oxygen at a space velocity of about 5000 h-1. Bed temperatures during 
the ﬁrst stage should always be less than 3500C. If necessary the oxygen content 
can be decreased to control hot spots. These conditions are maintained until the 
outlet temperature falls to the same level as the inlet temperature. At this point 
the oxygen content can be increased gradually and the bed temperature slowly 
raised to 5000C. The ﬁnal carbon content of the catalyst is normally less than 0.2 
wt%.  
 
6.6.3.2. Oxychlorination  
 
After carbon has been removed from the catalyst, the chlorine content usually 
falls to 0.6–0.8 wt%. The loss of chlorine must, therefore, be compensated by 
passing dry air that contains a suitable chlorine compound such as carbon tetra-
chloride over the catalyst at 4500C. Sufﬁcient chlorine must be used to restore 
the original 0.9–1.3 wt% chlorine level. About 70% of the total chlorine in the 
airstream is retained by the catalyst. A high space velocity of up to 5000 h-1 can 
be used.  
 
6.6.3.3. Platinum Re-Dispersal  
 
Platinum that has sintered during plant operation must be redispersed into the 
small crystallites required for active catalysis.  This is carried out by heating in a 
dry air flow at 5000C.  When the air leaving the reactor contains less than 5 ppm 
water the air should be purged from the catalyst bed until the oxygen content is 
less than 1 ppm.  It is thought that the redispersion treatment breaks down the 
larger platinum particles by producing volatile oxide or oxychloride complexes. 
These then react with surface hydroxyl groups to form smaller crystallites and 
restore activity.  
 
Refinery Catalysts  
253 
 
6.6.3.4. Catalyst Reduction  
 
Before use the new or regenerated catalyst is reduced in dry hydrogen at 500 C 
at a space velocity of 400 h-1 for about 2 h. This converts the platinum oxides 
into finely divided metal particles.  
 
6.6.4.  Catalyst Life  
 
Most of the initial activity reforming catalysts can be recovered during regen-
eration, although it is inevitable that some activity is lost during the procedure 
and catalysts are eventually replaced. The catalyst in semi-regenerative reform-
ers, which can be operated for 9 to 12 months before being regenerated, will not 
be changed for about 8 to 10 years. Catalyst in cyclic reformers, which are de-
signed for regeneration after only a few days, has a shorter life of only 4 to 5 
years. These estimates are only approximate and may be less depending on the 
feeds and operating conditions used.  
Although catalyst life in the continuous catalytic regeneration reformers is 
probably up to seven years, it is usually progressively replaced gradually as 
catalyst activity declines. It may also be necessary from time to time to remove 
catalyst from the reactor to clear any accumulated dust. This is usually recog-
nized by increased pressure drop or maldistribution of ﬂow giving hot spots. The 
catalyst can be replaced for further use after sieving. Any heel catalyst, contain-
ing up to 50% carbon, which has not been properly regenerated in isolated dead 
spots of the bed, can be separated and discarded.  
6.7.  
OCTANE BOOSTING  
Shape-selective reactions have been extensively studied since zeolites were ﬁrst 
used in catalytic crackers during 196749 and Mobil has introduced several oc-
tane-boosting processes since 1968.50 Gasoline composition and octane number 
were reviewed when the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. This mandated the 
phased removal of tetraethyl lead from gasoline as catalytic converters (see 
Chapter 11) were introduced to treat automobile exhaust gas. Octane boosting 
was the ﬁrst in a series of measures that led to reformulated gasoline and im-
proved exhaust emissions standards.  
 
6.7.1.  Selectoforming  
 
Shape-selective zeolite catalysts were ﬁrst used in the Selectoforming process by 
Mobil in 1968. Hydrogen-exchanged natural erionite, containing some nickel, 
0
254 
Chapter 6 
was used to crack and isomerize low-octane normal paraffins in reformate to 
increase the concentration of isoparaffins and boost the octane number. The 
nickel minimized carbon formation but did not saturate aromatics. The erionite 
was later replaced by synthetic zeolite T, which has the twelve-membered of-
fretite ring containing about 4% of eight-ring erionite and effectively prevents 
isoparafﬁns from entering the pores.  
 
6.7.2.  M-Forming  
 
By about 1970 the beneﬁts of ZSM-5 zeolite in cracking low-octane normal 
parafﬁns in FCC units were well known. By adding 1% of ZSM-5 as a promoter 
to reforming catalysts it was possible to increase the octane number of reformate 
at the expense of some liquid yield.  
In the 1970’s, the octane number of the product from the catalytic reforming 
of light naphthas was only RON 84. This was too low to satisfy the changing 
market, and the M-forming process was developed by Mobil to use ZSM-5 zeo-
lites containing nickel as catalyst. Octane number was increased to RON 93 be-
cause the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite crack single-branched paraffins at about 
3150C. Higher-octane products are formed by oligomerization, aromatization, 
and alkylation reactions. There is an increase in yield and less gas formation 
compared with the Selectoforming process.  
6.8.  
AROMATICS PRODUCTION  
Reformers can also be operated to maximize the production of aromatics. When 
benzene is the required product, a narrow fraction boiling in the range 60–900C 
is used under severe operating conditions. If the feed is changed to a fraction 
boiling in the range 110–1400C under similar high severity conditions, the main 
product is a mixture of toluene and mixed xylenes. Normally however, the main 
object of reforming is to maximize the octane rating of the product.  
 
6.8.1.  Aromatics Process 
  
L-zeolite, potassium exchanged and also containing some platinum, is an active 
catalyst for the conversion of n-hexane to aromatic compounds. L-zeolite is a 
wide-pore zeolite, with a silica/alumina ratio of six and a unidimensional pore 
structure.  
The commercial catalysts described and used in the Chevron Aromax pro-
cess were partly exchanged with barium ions and contained platinum (0.6–0.8%)

naphthas. These zeolite catalysts are, however, more easily poisoned by sulfur 
compounds because they are based on platinum and feedstock must be desulfu-
rized.  
 
6.8.2.  Cyclar Process  
 
BP and UOP developed a process to convert liquid petroleum gas (LPG), a mix-
ture of propane and butane, into aromatics.52 A plant using this process began 
operating in 1989 at the BP reﬁnery in Grangemouth, Scotland, and a second 
followed in 1999 operated by Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) in Saudi Arabia.  
The catalyst is based on a ZSM-5 zeolite containing gallium. The yield of 
aromatics is about 60%, with more than 90% as benzene, toluene, with some 
xylene and relatively small amounts of C9 aromatics. Up to 2000 standard cubic 
feet of hydrogen per barrel of feed is produced. Reaction proceeds at 4250C by 
dehydrogenation of the paraffins followed by oligomerization and cyclization. A 
four-bed UOP continuous catalytic regeneration reactor is used with interbed 
heating of the reaction mixture. Aromatics are separated from the remaining 
aliphatic hydrocarbons by distillation.  
Japanese research on converting propane to aromatics in the presence of 
CO2 on ZSM-5 catalyst loaded with zinc showed that equilibrium was improved 
as hydrogen was removed by the reverse water gas shift reaction: 
 
 
  
H2 + CO2 '  H2O + CO  
(6.6) 
 
6.8.3.  M2-Forming Process  
 
The M2-Forming process introduced by Mobil uses a ZSM-5 zeolite to convert 
both virgin naphtha (C5–1100C) and oleﬁnic gasolines (C6–1100C) from FCC 
and thermal crackers into aromatic compounds. It operates at a higher tempera-
ture than the M-Forming process and at about 5500C the selectivity to aromatics 
approaches 100%.53 
6.9. CATALYTIC DEWAXING  
The viscosity of high-boiling fuels and lube oils can be reduced by shape-
selective cracking of long-chain paraffins in the presence of hydrogen. Several 
zeolites introduced during the 1990s have been used: H-mordenite containing 
platinum by BP; ferrierite containing palladium by Shell; ZSM-5 by Mobil. The 
exchange of zeolite with the precious metal promoted the hydrogenation of coke 
precursors at the high operating pressures,54 and extended catalyst lifetimes.  
 
256 
Chapter 6 
Typical operating conditions are: reactor temperature, 300–3500C; pressure, 
20– 130 atm; hydrogen partial pressure, 15–100 atm.  
6.10.  ISOMERIZATION  
The catalytic reforming of straight-run naphtha to gasoline is usually restricted 
to feeds in the boiling range 100–1800C. This is because the equilibrium conver-
sion of the lower-boiling normal C5–C6 parafﬁns under typical operating condi-
tions is too low to obtain a reasonable improvement in higher-octane-number 
branched isomers.  
A separate process to isomerize the straight-run C5–C6 cut is used to com-
plement catalytic reforming and produce gasoline with good octane qualities 
over the whole boiling range. The change in octane number as a range of C5–C6 
hydrocarbons is isomerized, is shown in Table 6.21. To achieve the most suita-
ble product, however, a high–activity catalyst must operate at the lowest possi-
ble temperature. This improves equilibrium conversion and increases the propor-
tion of dimethyl isomers rather than single-branch isomers.  
 
6.10.1.  Isomerization Catalysts  
 
Isomerization processes developed slowly because of the low demand for higher 
octane numbers and operational problems with aluminum chloride, the ﬁrst cata-
lyst to be developed. Despite high activity at 115–1200C, aluminum chloride has 
the major disadvantages of the formation of sludges and acid corrosion of 
equipment.

The introduction of dual-function catalysts for naphtha reforming and the 
demand for high-octane gasoline led to further interest in isomerization. The 
platinum/alumina (chlorided) catalysts were a success despite the resulting low-
er conversion to high-octane products from the need to operate at higher temper-
atures. The Shell Hysomer process, which used a 5A-zeolite to separate low-
octane parafﬁns from the product allowed operators to recycle unconverted feed 
and achieve almost 100% conversion.55 
A further important development was the use of hydrogen-exchanged mor-
denite zeolite as the catalyst support. The zeolite was more stable and water tol-
erant than the chlorided alumina and did not need chloride addition during oper-
ation. The zeolite catalyst had a lower activity than that of alumina, but the need 
to operate at a slightly higher operating temperature was acceptable since the 
normal paraffins could be recycled. Other zeolites, such as β-zeolite, have also 
been used as the acid support.  
Operating conditions for the different catalysts are given in Table 6.22. Hy-
drogen is usually added to minimize coke formation but is not used in the reac-
tions taking place.  
 
6.10.2.  Reaction Mechanism  
 
The isomerization of normal C5–C6 parafﬁns proceeds by dehydrogenation on 
the platinum surface followed by isomerization of the oleﬁn formed on the acid 
support. The isomer is then hydrogenated on the platinum to give the higher-
octane branched paraffin.  
Platinum in the dual-function catalyst is important in reducing the steady-
state oleﬁn concentration, otherwise polymerization and cracking would lead to 
extensive coke formation. Some coke, however, does deposit slowly and the 
catalyst has to be regenerated at intervals. Mordenite supports are more stable 
than chlorided aluminas and can operate for longer at more than 60% conversion
 
and about 97% selectivity. Catalysts are reported to operate for as long as seven 
years before being replaced.

Butane can also be isomerized with platinum on chlorided alumina cata-
lysts, under the same conditions, to produce isobutane for use as feedstock in 
alkylation processes and more recently for the production of MTBE .

PETROCHEMICAL CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
7.1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PETROCHEMICALS 
Organic chemical compounds have been produced on an industrial scale for over 
a century. In the early days, the source of carbon was coal, and many of the 
compounds were produced via the intermediate manufacture of acetylene and 
benzene. The development of crude oil refining and the use of new processes to 
satisfy the increase in demand for gasoline has provided refinery off-gases and 
other hydrocarbons that are now used as the main source of industrial organic 
compounds, and the term petrochemicals arose to describe this evolution of the 
chemical industry. 
 
For example, in the early years following the development of the Haber-
Bosch process for the manufacture of ammonia, both ammonia and methanol 
were manufactured from synthesis gas derived from coal. This was eventually 
replaced by a naphtha-like fraction from the refining of crude oil, and much of 
the World capacity for methanol and ammonia is now derived from natural gas. 
In general, refinery feeds have now replaced coal for the production of synthesis 
gas almost entirely, and both ammonia and methanol can rightly be regarded as 
petrochemicals. Such is the scale of modern refining, together with the increased 
demand for petrochemical products such as plastics, fibers, and rubber, petro-
chemical complexes are now frequently closely linked to refineries. For exam-
ple, of the 666 million tonnes of naphtha produced in 1997, up to 40% were 
used in the steam crackers and aromatics units that provided feeds for petro-
chemical production. Many chemicals are made using continuously operating 
refinery-like processes, often with several reaction steps in sequence, and the

products must be produced to tight chemical specifications. Some of the oxida-
tion, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions developed more than 80 years 
ago are still being used, although efficiency and selectivity have been greatly 
improved by the use of better catalysts and equipment. 
 
About 1914 the volume of gasoline sold exceeded the demand for kerosene. 
Consequently thermal cracking processes were introduced, since these resulted 
in an increase in the gasoline yield from crude oil. However, cracking produced 
large volumes of low-molecular-weight gases, which at first were used as fuel. 
The almost worthless gas did, however, contain significant volumes of olefins, 
which were eventually to become the aliphatic building blocks used in produc-
ing high-octane gasoline and, later, petrochemicals. 
 
The Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh was founded in 1911 by a group includ-
ing the Mellon brothers, who were the main shareholders in the Gulf Oil Corpo-
ration. George Curme of the Institute worked with both Prest-O-Lite, which 
supplied acetylene lamps, and Union Carbide, the largest supplier of calcium 
carbide, on alternative ways to produce acetylene and commercially useful or-
ganic derivatives of both acetylene and ethylene. In a series of experiments, it 
was demonstrated that ethylene produced by cracking had potential to be a 
cheaper chemical intermediate than acetylene. 
 
Union Carbide and Linde then began to develop the production of ethylene 
from the ethane present in natural gas. This led to the purchase of a small gaso-
line plant at Clendenin, West Virginia, where ethane-rich natural gas was avail-
able from the Kanawha Valley. An ethane-cracking unit began operation in 1921 
and provided ethylene as well as liquefied petroleum gas that was sold for do-
mestic use. 
 
Following further development work, ethylene glycol became the first pet-
rochemical to be produced at the ethylene plant in South Charleston that began 
operating about 1925. Glycol antifreeze was widely used in automobile engines 
by 1927. Numerous other organic syntheses were being developed at the same 
time for commercial production in the small petrochemical complex. By 1926, 
as many as six ethylene and two propylene derivatives were available, and by 
1934 the number had increased to 35-ethylene and 15-propylene products.1 
 
During the same period Universal Oil Products developed olefin polymeri-
zation and hydrogenation processes and the Shell Chemical Company became 
interested in olefin chemistry and petrochemicals. Shell opened its Emeryville, 
California, research center in 1928 and developed methods for the production of 
alcohols, ketones, and esters from propylene and butylenes, as well as synthetic 
chlorohydrins, glycols, and glycerol. Many of these petroleum chemicals were 
produced in Martinez, California, from 1933 and the use of petrochemical cata-
lysts became established. 
 
By 1940, after the start of World War II, the production of petroleum chem-
icals, as they were still known, and the use of catalysts were common practice in 
the United States. Subsequently, the 1930s became known as the miracle dec-

ade, because the catalysts petrochemical processes that had been introduced 
began to provide artificial fibers, polymers, and synthetic rubbers. The use and 
development of these processes and the associated technology were accelerated 
as demand caused by the war required plants to be built to produce large quanti-
ties of polyvinyl chloride, butadiene–styrene rubber, polyethylene, and nylon. 
 
Until 1945, most developments in the petrochemical industry arose in the 
United States, where refinery processes were advanced and feedstocks were 
readily available. There were no similar refineries in Europe and chemical pro-
duction was still firmly based on coal. Petrochemicals could not be produced in 
Europe until the late 1950s, when the first large refineries were built and cheap 
naphtha was used in steam crackers and for ammonia production. Estimates of 
petrochemical production in both the United States and Europe from 1935 to 
1965 demonstrate the difference as shown in Table 7.1. 
 
More than 90% of today’s petrochemicals are produced from refinery prod-
ucts. Most are based on the use of C2–C4 olefins and aromatics from hydrocar-
bon steam cracking units, which are even more closely linked to refineries. In 
North America, the feedstock for steam cracker units have generally been 
ethane, propane, or LPG. As a result, most of the propylene and aromatics have 
been provided by FCC units and catalytic reformers. In many other parts of the 
world where naphtha feed has been more readily available, supplies of propyl-
ene and aromatics have been produced directly by steam cracking. When neces-
sary, the catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins or dealkylation of toluene can 
balance the supply of olefins or benzene. In Table 7.2 some of the catalytic pro-
cesses that convert olefins and benzene from a steam cracker into basic petro-
chemicals for the modern chemical industry are shown. 
 
Before 1965, the production of petrochemicals as a new branch of the 
chemical industry does not seem to have been widely mentioned in textbooks 
and little general information was available.2 Industry, however, well aware of 
the potential demand for the new products, was developing large new plants to 
take advantage of the economies possible from large-scale operation. ICI, for 
example, opened its Petrochemical and Polymer Laboratory⎯later to become its 
Corporate  Laboratory⎯about this time.  Since then many  new processes and

petrochemical products have been introduced. Generally the processes have used 
catalysts and include development of the hydrogenation and oxidation proce-
dures first used in the 1920s and 1930s. Many new reactions and syntheses have 
now evolved and the range of catalysts has undergone continuous improvement. 
The industry has moved a long way from the time when DuPont claimed it had 
made a fiber—Nylon—from coal-air-water! Fully detailed information is not 
usually provided, but the importance of petrochemical processes has now been 
recognized and is described in many reviews and books.3 Annual meetings and 
conferences are organized by chemical societies, chemical engineering societies 
and catalyst companies to review the latest processes, catalyst science and cata-
lyst developments.

Petrochemical Catalysts 
265 
 
7.1.1. Isopropyl Alcohol 
 
Isopropanol was one of the first petrochemicals to be produced on a large scale 
and is still widely used as a solvent and chemical intermediate. Originally, pro-
duction was by direct catalytic hydration of propylene in the liquid phase: 
 
 
  
C3H6  +  H2O  →  C3H7OH 
(7.1) 
 
Concentrated 70–98% sulfuric acid was used as the catalyst at a low pressure 
and temperature. The reaction mechanism involved the sulfate monoester inter-
mediate, which was then hydrolyzed to isopropanol. The process is similar to the 
production of ethanol from ethylene, although the hydration step becomes easier 
as the carbon number of the olefin increases. The acid strength required for ef-
fective operation decreases from more than 90% for ethylene hydration to about 
70% for propylene hydration. 
 
The homogeneous sulfuric acid process has since been replaced by phos-
phoric acid–impregnated silica and tungstic oxide catalysts. The tungstic acid 
catalyst operated at pressures as high as 250 atm and at 2500–2900C, whereas 
phosphoric acid was active at 25–50 atm and 1700–1900C. A high wa-
ter/propylene ratio of about 2–5 was required in order to avoid polymer for-
mation. Although selectivity was as high as 97%, the propylene conversion was 
only about 6%. 
 
A trickle phase process using strong acid-ion exchangers has now been de-
veloped by Deutsche Texaco. The process operates with a high water/propylene 
ratio of 12–15 at 80–100 atm and 1300–1600C to give 75% propylene conversion 
at up to 95% selectivity. The ion exchange resin loses activity after about 8 
months as the acid groups on the resin are hydrolyzed. Other olefins, ranging 
from ethylene to butylenes can also be hydrated with acid-ion exchange resins. 
 
7.1.1.1.  Acetone 
 
Until about 1970 most of the acetone used was produced in the gas phase from 
the azeotropic mixture of isopropanol and water by a dehydrogenation process: 
 
 
  
C3H7OH  →  CH3COCH3  +  H2 
(7.2) 
 
A copper oxide/zinc oxide catalyst (1  CuO / 2 ZnO) was operated in the tem-
perature range 2200–3400C to give a 95% yield at about 90% conversion. The 
reaction was endothermic and took place in 20-ft long, 2-in diameter tubes with 
the operating temperature limited by the maximum allowable flue gas tempera-
ture. At 3250C, the equilibrium conversion was about 97% at 5 atm. At higher 
temperatures, however, increasing byproducts formation decreased selectivity to 
less than 90–95% more than offsetting any advantage from increased conver-
266 
Chapter 7 
 
sion. Activity was greater with low impurity levels in the catalyst, such as the 
residual sodium remaining from the precipitation stage of preparation, and high 
physical strength was needed. Spent catalyst was removed from the narrow 
tubes by drilling, as polymeric by-products tended to gum up the reactor tubes. 
 
Another gas phase dehydrogenation process was used to prepare methyl 
ethyl ketone (MEK) from secondary butanol with a similar copper oxide/zinc 
oxide catalyst: 
 
 
  
C2H5CH(OH)CH3  →  C2H5COCH3  +  H2 
(7.3) 
 
However, a liquid phase dehydrogenation process, using Raney nickel or Raney 
copper catalysts in a high-boiling solvent at about 1500C, gave 80–95% second-
ary butanol conversion to MEK at more than 95% selectivity. 
 
With the introduction of the cumene–phenol process, which provides large 
volumes of acetone by-product, the older dehydrogenation process is now rarely 
used. 
 
7.1.1.2. Bisphenol-A 
 
Bisphenol-A is produced at 5000C by the condensation of acetone with phenol in 
the presence of an acid catalyst. In early processes sulfuric acid or dry hydro-
chloric acid was promoted with methyl mercaptans. More recently acid ion ex-
change resins have been used: 
 
 
2 C6H5OH + CH3COCH3 → C6H4(OH)C(CH3)2C6H4(OH) + H2O 
(7.4) 
 
Bisphenol-A is used in the manufacture of epoxy resins, plastics such as poly-
carbonates, and polysulfones. 
 
7.1.1.3. Cumene 
 
It was realized during World War II that alkylated benzene molecules could be 
used to increase the octane level of aviation gasoline. The Petroleum Admin-
istration for War had asked for a high-octane synthetic aromatic component in 
1941 and propyl benzene, also known as cumene, and butyl benzene were pro-
duced in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. In 1944, the 
Hock and Lang process,4 which produced phenol and acetone from cumene was 
introduced, and this industrial process became the basis of the major source of 
phenol throughout the world: 
 
 
  
C6H6  +  C3H6  →  C6H5.C3H7 
(7.5) 
 
 
  
C6H5.C3H7  +  O2  →  C6H5.C3H6(OOH) 
(7.6) 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts 
267 
 
 
 
  
C6H5.C3H6(OOH)  →  C6H5OH  +  CH3COCH3 
(7.7) 
 
More recently, new processes for phenol which do not produce acetone by prod-
ucts have been described. 
 
As in all alkylation reactions the catalyst used to produce cumene from pro-
pylene and benzene is a strong acid and a number of processes have been intro-
duced. The first were developed by Distillers and Hercules in 1953: 
• Sulfuric acid or aluminum trichloride in the liquid phase at 350–400C and 
7 atm. 
• Hydrofluoric acid in the liquid phase at 500–700C and 7 atm. 
• Phosphoric acid supported on kieselguhr promoted with HF in the gas 
phase at 2000–3000C and 20–40 atm. 
 
Phosphoric acid/kieselguhr with added steam or aluminum trichloride have 
been the most widely used catalytic processes. Excess benzene is usually added 
to the reaction mixture to limit the formation of di- and tri-propylbenzene and to 
maximize the selectivity of propylene to cumene. Pure propylene must be used 
to avoid the production of ethyl benzene. 
 
Typical acid catalysts are not regenerable and particularly in the case of 
aluminium trichloride can lead to disposal problems, so zeolites are now increas-
ingly used as active catalysts. Early problems were encountered with relatively 
fast deactivation or the formation of ethyl benzene and butyl benzene from me-
tathesis (disproportionation) reactions. These were overcome when Dow intro-
duced a dealuminated mordenite catalyst (3DDM—three-dimensional dealumi-
nated mordenite) that was both stable over 18 months of testing and regenera-
ble.5 Yields with the mordenite catalyst are greater than 99% and purity is al-
most 100%. ENI in Italy used a selective ß-zeolite catalyst and process im-
provements led to an increased plant capacity of 30–40%. 
 
Cumene is converted by a two-step, noncatalytic process into phenol and 
acetone. It is first oxidized to hydroperoxide with air at 5–10 atm in an alkaline 
solution at pH 8.5–10 and 900–1300C. The hydroperoxide is then converted to 
phenol and acetone in either a homogeneous 0.1–2% sulfuric acid solution at 
600–650C or a two-phase liquid mixture with 40% sulfuric acid at 500C. 
 
7.1.2. Vinyl Chloride 
 
Vinyl chloride was first prepared by Regnier in 18356 when working with Lie-
big. He chlorinated ethylene, or olefiant gas, as it was then known, and convert-
ed the ethylene dichloride, or oil of Dutch chemists (1795), to vinyl chloride by 
reaction with caustic potash solution: 
 
 
  
C2H4  +  Cl2  →  C2H4Cl2

C2H4Cl2  +  KOH  →  CH2=CHCl   +  KCl  +  H2O 
(7.9) 
 
The first reference to the compound as vinyl chloride was by Kolbe in 1854.7 
Baumann later described polyvinyl chloride in 1872 when he gave a good sum-
mary of its properties.8 
 
Around 1900, when industry began to take an interest in acetylene chemis-
try, Fritz Klatte produced vinyl chloride at 1800C from acetylene and hydrogen 
chloride: 
 
 
  
CH≡CH  +  HCl  →  CH2=CHCl 
(7.10) 
 
Patents for his process were issued to Griesheim–Electron in 1912/1913.9,10 
They described a mercuric chloride catalyst supported on coke or pumice. The 
early catalysts described in 1912 could only operate for short periods because 
mercury compounds sublime at reaction temperature. Although the 1913 patent 
described reaction in aqueous solution with the mercuric chloride catalyst, this 
process was never used industrially. A further patent in 1913 claimed that the 
process only took place in the presence of the mercury catalyst that accelerated 
the reaction.11 
 
The volatility of mercury compounds led the Consortium für Electrochem-
ische Industrie to patent a catalyst in 1928 based on mercury or bismuth com-
pounds supported on active carbon or silica gel,12 which retained its activity for 
100 hours. B. F. Goodrich also claimed that complex salts, such as HgCl2.2KCl 
or HgCl2.BaCl2, were not only less volatile but more active.13 None of the later 
catalysts was as efficient as mercuric chloride on charcoal in terms of the space 
time yield, despite their longer lives. The early catalysts gave better results at 
lower temperatures with good temperature control. Developments prior to 1940 
were reviewed by Kaufmann14 and showed that vinyl chloride could be produced 
from either ethylene or acetylene. Early processes, however, still used acetylene, 
which was more readily available, although at that time demand was not great. 
 
In the 1920s, Union Carbide recovered by-product ethylene dichloride from 
its ethylene oxide plant for conversion to vinyl chloride.14 Vinylite, a relatively 
soft copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, was used to produce gramo-
phone records and other useful items. Plasticizers were then developed to pro-
vide the softer grades of polyvinyl chloride that were widely used during the 
World War II. By 1939, the acetylene-based vinyl chloride process had been 
developed commercially and was used to supply PVC for the war effort. During 
the period from 1935 to 1940 the only industrial producers were Germany, with 
about 110 tons a month, and the United States, where, in 1936, production 
reached 950 tons a year. The German catalysts and processes were described in 
various BIOS,  FIAT,  and CIOS reports and other publications  after the end of

the war; operation from 1939 to 1945 is shown in Table 7.3.14 No similar details 
were released for the US process. The same mercuric chloride catalyst supported 
on charcoal was still being used, acetylene was still the preferred feedstock, and 
the use of PVC was rapidly expanding. 
 
The demand for larger vinyl chloride plants coincided with the development 
of hydrocarbon steam crackers. Ethylene reacts directly with chlorine forming 
ethylene dichloride, which was decomposed thermally to produce vinyl chloride. 
The byproduct hydrogen chloride could then be used to produce more vinyl 
chloride as a feedstock for the acetylene process. This was described as the bal-
anced ethylene–acetylene process:15 
 
 
CH2=CH2 + Cl2 → CH2Cl.CH2Cl (direct addition) 
(7.11) 
 
  CH2Cl.CH2Cl → CH2=CHCl + HCl (thermal reaction and HCl recycle) (7.12) 
 
 
CH≡CH + HCl → CH2=CHCl (mercuric chloride catalyst) 
(7.13) 
 
 
The ethylene–acetylene balanced process could, therefore, solve the prob-
lem of hydrogen chloride disposal, although only half of the vinyl chloride was 
produced from ethylene. The manufacture of acetylene is a very energy-
intensive process, and compared to ethylene, acetylene is very expensive to pro-
duce. Ethylene would, therefore always be the preferred feedstock for the pro-
duction of petrochemicals, provided that suitable technology was available. 
 
Development of the oxychlorination process, which used a copper chloride 
catalyst, improved the situation because it only required ethylene as feedstock. 
The oxychlorination of ethylene for the manufacture of vinyl chloride is a three-
stage process. The first stage is the addition of chlorine gas to ethylene to pro-
duce 1-2 dichloroethane. The second stage is the cracking of the dichloroethane 
270 
Chapter 7 
 
to vinyl chloride and hydrogen chloride. The third stage is the oxychlorination 
reaction itself, in which hydrogen chloride from the cracking stage is reacted 
with air, or in later processes, oxygen, to produce more dichloroethane, which is 
then recycled to the second stage.

The cupric chloride catalyst was promoted with potassium chloride and 
supported on activated alumina. It was related to the Deacon catalyst, which was 
developed for chlorine production in 1887. 
 
The first oxychlorination plant was built by B. F. Goodrich in 196416 and 
produced 30 million lb.year−1 of vinyl chloride in a fluid bed. At about the same 
time the Stauffer Chemical Company built a unit using three tube-cooled ox-
ychlorination reactors in series. This was the beginning of the end for routes 
based on acetylene. 
 
7.1.2.1. The Oxychlorination Reaction 
 
The need to recover hydrogen chloride from the ethylene dichloride cracking 
reaction introduced during the early 1960s led to a renewed interest in the Dea-
con process, although the low equilibrium concentration of chlorine in hydrogen 
chloride/air mixtures at a reasonable temperature made economic recovery im-
possible.  
 
It was found, however, that the Deacon catalysts could chlorinate ethylene 
with a mixture of hydrogen chloride and air. The Deacon reaction did not pro-
duce molecular chlorine but chlorinated ethylene directly as chlorine species 
formed on the catalyst surface. Low equilibrium conversion to chlorine and its 
slow removal from the catalyst surface were no longer limitations and complete 
chlorination of the ethylene was achieved at temperatures in the range 2100–
2400C. Free chlorine was never found even with low ethylene concentrations. 
 
7.1.2.2. Oxychlorination Catalyst 
 
Suitable catalysts are similar to the original Deacon catalyst. The copper chlo-
ride is supported on medium-surface-area alumina with pore sizes in the range 
80–600 Å.17 While copper chloride is more active than other metals it is also 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts 
271 
 
volatile at reaction temperature. Potassium chloride is added to decrease the loss 
of copper and reduce the formation of by-product ethyl chloride, even though it 
also reduces the overall activity. The copper chloride content of the catalyst 
must be limited because an excess would lead to catalyst caking during reaction, 
since the complexes KCuCl3 and K2CuCl4 have naturally low melting points. 
The eutectic mixture with copper chloride melts at 150°C. Catalysts may also 
contain other alkali and rare earth chlorides and promoters that help to control 
the reaction or inhibit side reactions.17 
 
The reaction mechanism was originally thought to be as follows: 
 
 
C2H4 + 2 CuCl2  →  CH2Cl.CH2Cl + Cu2Cl2 
(7.18) 
 
 
Cu2Cl2 + ½ O2  →  CuO.CuCl2 
(7.19) 
 
 
CuO.CuCl2 + 2 HCl  →  2 CuCl2 + H2O 
(7.20) 
 
The overall reaction is: 
 
 
C2H4 + 2HCl + 1/2O2 →CH2Cl.CH2Cl + H2O 
(7.21) 
 
 
Catalysts are usually prepared on a large scale by impregnating a suitable 
alumina support with aqueous solutions of cupric chloride and potassium chlo-
ride. Other alkali metals or rare earth chlorides have been used as promoters or 
to inhibit by-product formation. 
 
7.1.2.3. Catalyst Operation 
 
The overall reaction is very exothermic, and temperature control is extremely 
important in vinyl chloride production to maintain a satisfactory selectivity. This 
is relatively easy in fluidized beds, which is probably the most widely used pro-
cess, but more difficult when fixed bed tubular reactors are used. High bed tem-
peratures result in the dehydrochlorination of the ethylene dichloride to give 
vinyl chloride, and this can lead to the formation of other chlorinated products. 
Increased oxidation of the ethylene feed to carbon dioxide also occurs as the 
temperature increases. Coke formation and copper loss by sublimation also in-
crease with higher bed temperatures. 
 
In tubular reactors the proportions and concentration of the reactants can be 
changed to control the reaction or the tube diameter design can be decreased. 
The most common ways to control the reaction are to dilute the catalyst with 
inert balls or to vary the copper chloride content of the catalyst. There is a rapid 
increase in catalyst temperature at the top of the tubes where most of the exo-
thermic reaction takes place giving a significant hot spot. This can be controlled 
to a certain extent by splitting the total air addition between the three beds. Good 
272 
Chapter 7 
 
control at the inlet to the first bed is necessary in any case to ensure that the ex-
plosive limit is not exceeded. The addition of fused alumina, graphite, or other 
inert diluents to the catalyst can limit the temperature rise, although there are 
practical problems in mixing catalyst with inert materials. 
 
Stauffer18 described a process consisting of a single reactor containing up to 
four different layers of a catalyst containing 8.5% cupric chloride. Each succes-
sive layer was diluted with an inert substance to control the exothermical reac-
tion. The first layer only contained 7% of catalyst, the others containing 15%, 
then 40% and the final layer contained 100% catalyst. However, better control 
with diluted catalyst was obtained in a series of several separate reactors. A top 
layer of special catalyst to initiate or strike the reaction was used in the first re-
actor. An even better degree of control was obtained with three different catalyst 
compositions containing varying amounts of cupric chloride. Typically, catalysts 
containing 6%, 10%, and finally 18% cupric chloride, promoted with 3%, 3%, 
and then 2% potassium chloride respectively, each packed in layers, were the 
optimum. Beds 1 and 2 contained 40% of both the 6% copper chloride and 10% 
copper chloride, respectively, on top of the 18% copper chloride catalyst. Bed 3 
was completely filled with the more concentrated catalyst. 
 
Catalyst life in tube-cooled reactors depends on the operating conditions, 
but in reactor 1 the catalyst is usually changed after one year. Life increases to 
one and a half years and three years in reactors 2 and 3, respectively, where 
conditions are less severe and the intensity of the temperature hot spots de-
crease. There are usually hot spots at the position in tubes where the catalyst 
type changes. Up to 50% of the air can be added to the first reactor and must be 
carefully controlled to avoid the explosive limit. The balance of air is added to 
the second and third reactors to minimize the hot spot and to maintain conver-
sion. Oxygen can replace air when convenient because this reduces the gas to be 
vented from the system, simplifies the incineration of noxious products and 
makes environmental control easier. 
 
In fluidized bed reactors the preheated gas mixture enters the base of the 
vessel and temperature is controlled either by cooling coils or a bundle of cool-
ing tubes in the fluid bed. The oxychlorination reaction takes place at a relative-
ly low temperature, around 220–2250C, and at a low pressure of about 2 bar. The 
catalyst support consists of microspheroidal γ-alumina particles, with a median 
particle size around 50–60 microns. The particles are impregnated with an aque-
ous mixture of cupric and potassium chlorides, to give a copper content around 
12%. One of the main process problems with oxychlorination19 is a possible 
tendency for the catalyst particles to cake or to stick to the cooling bundles with-
in the reactor. This results in poor temperature control, local overheating, and a 
loss in selectivity. The surface area of the alumina is in the range 150–250 
m2.g−1, with 94% of the particles greater than 6 μm and 24% greater than 80 
μm.19 Fresh catalyst is added to replace fines lost from the bed. An excess of air 
is added to maximize hydrochloric acid conversion and unreacted ethylene is

recycled. Yields of 98% on hydrochloric acid and 96% on ethylene can be ob-
tained. By-products are chloral, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloro-
ethylene, and ethyl chloride. In modern processes pure oxygen is used instead of 
air. This enables much easier recovery of product and catalyst fines, also ena-
bling a reduction in the volume of vent gas by at least 95% and a reduction in 
both energy and capital costs.20 Since the oxychlorination process was intro-
duced plant capacities have increased from about 10,000 to more than 600,000 
tonnes a year. 
7.2. SYNTHETIC RUBBER FROM BUTADIENE AND STYRENE 
In the 1930s, a wide range of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes was 
already developed by companies in the petroleum industry to increase gasoline 
yield. Olefins had been used to provide polygasoline and alkylates, as well as 
many other petrochemical intermediates.  
A form of synthetic rubber had been  
made in Germany since the 1914–1918 war and in 1929 two I. G. Farben chem-
ists from Leverkusen patented a variety they named Buna-S.21 It was a co-
polymer of butadiene containing 25% styrene and, as a result of many improve-
ments, is still being used. However, at the time it was difficult to process, ther-
mally unstable during use, and was expensive to produce. Other synthetic rub-
bers soon followed. Neoprene, produced from chlorobutadiene and originally 
named Duprene, was developed by DuPont and used in several applications.22 I. 
G. Farben also produced Buna-N, replacing the styrene in Buna-S with acryloni-
trile. At the time Buna-N was unsuccessful, although it did eventually lead to the 
present large-scale production of acrylonitrile. By 1940, when the  
Reserve Company was formed in the USA, two of the most significant rubber 
intermediates were butadiene and styrene. The potential wartime shortage of 
natural rubber then led the Rubber Reserve Company to make plans for four 
plants to produce synthetic rubber, which was known as GR-S rubber (Govern-
ment Rubber-Styrene), and by November 1943 a total of 15 plants were operat-
ing.23 Production of GR-S rubber increased from about 4000 tonnes in 1942 to 
almost 1 million tonnes in 1946. Production fell as the war ended but increased 
again to more than 600,000 tonnes a year from 1951 to 1953, while the Korean 
War was in progress. 
 
Production on such a large scale led to an increasing demand for the rela-
tively new petrochemicals butadiene and styrene. When wartime rubber produc-
tion was being planned most commercial butadiene was produced as a by-
product from the high-temperature steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic crack-
ing of oil fractions. The quantity, however, was very small. It was therefore ap-
parent that, in addition to making more of the quickie butadiene, other methods 
would have to be developed. Two sources were potentially available. One possi-
bility was a process that had been used in Russia to produce butadiene from 
274 
Chapter 7 
 
butane and n-butene by processes that were still being developed. 
 
Nine dehydrogenation plants were eventually authorized by the Rubber Re-
serve Company to make 330,000 tonnes year−1 of butadiene.24 Two were based 
on butane and seven on butene. During construction of these plants it was also 
decided to make about 220,000 tonnes.year−1 of butadiene by the Russian Lebe-
dev process based on ethanol: 
 
 
  
C4H10  →  C4H6  +  2H2 
(7.22) 
 
 
  
C4H8  →  C4H6  +  H2 
(7.23) 
 
 
Little is known about the Lebedev process, which was developed in Russia 
in 1927 during the investigation of synthetic rubber production. It was a one-
step process that converted ethanol to butadiene by simultaneous dehydrogena-
tion, dehydration, and condensation stages:25 
 
 
  
2 C2H5OH → C4H6 + 2 H2O + H2 
(7.24) 
 
 
The catalyst used was nominally a mixture of 75% magnesia and 25% silica 
or siliceous earth, which are well known as dehydrogenation and dehydration 
catalysts respectively. Up to 3% chromium oxide was included to inhibit the 
formation of magnesium silicate. 
 
Carbon formed on the catalyst during operation at 270°–300°C, so that re-
generation was required every 12–16 h. The catalyst was soon deactivated and 
had to be changed after only 30 days. A maximum butadiene yield of 60% was 
achieved.26 As with most catalysts, the original recipe must have been modified 
as revealed in BIOS reports on the German use of the catalyst.27 Whereas the 
composition was reported to be 100 parts magnesium oxide with 15 parts kaolin 
and 1–3 parts chromia, the analysis of an authentic sample was somewhat dif-
ferent.28 The catalyst was made by wet mixing the components, extruding the 
mixture, and calcining at 500°C for 2–3 h before use.  Commercial dehydrogena-
tion processes are usually limited to propane and butane feeds because they op-
erate below the thermal steam cracking temperature. Nevertheless, a high reac-
tion temperature is still required to achieve a reasonable conversion close to the 
thermodynamic equilibrium. Frey and Huppke indicated that chromia catalysts 
gave a good yield of olefins from the corresponding alkanes.29 Later, Burgin and 
Groll patented chromia/alumina catalysts containing 6–40% Cr2O3 and it was 
found that the optimum chromium content to dehydrogenate propane was lower 
than that required to dehydrogenate n-butane. Promoters such as potash or mag-
nesia were used to reduce carbon decomposition during operation.30

275 
 
7.2.1. Butadiene from Butane 
 
All butane dehydrogenation processes used chromium catalysts supported on γ-
alumina. Catalysts were generally made by impregnating a preformed support 
with chromic acid solution that also contained the magnesium or potassium 
promoter. Processes operated at a high temperature and low butane partial pres-
sure to compensate for the high hydrogen content of reaction gases and to im-
prove the equilibrium conversion. The Houdry or Catadiene process was used in 
only two of the Rubber Reserve Company plants and was the only process able 
to produce butadiene directly from butane. The chromia/alumina catalyst, con-
taining 15–20% chromia, was used in several adiabatic reactors operating in 
parallel. Despite being diluted with a dense inert material the catalyst was deac-
tivated by carbon deposition after about 7–15 min of operation at 620°–650°C 
and a reduced pressure of 3 psig. Liquid butane space velocity was in the range 
1–2 h−1. The reactor containing deactivated catalyst was taken out of service and 
replaced by a spare reactor to give continuous operation. Deactivated catalyst 
was then regenerated in air and diluted with an inert gas at 500°C before reuse. 
 
Overall selectivity to butadiene was only 55–60%, with conversions in the 
range 30–40%. The feed gas was preheated using the heat evolved from the 
combustion of carbon that had been laid down on the surface of the catalyst dur-
ing operation. Thus, carbon lay-down and catalyst regeneration became an inte-
gral part of the process. 
 
Butane was also dehydrogenated, usually to butene, by the Phillips and 
UOP processes. Both processes used the same sort of chromia/alumina catalysts, 
loaded in tubular reactors, but were able to operate at atmospheric pressure be-
cause less hydrogen was produced during the reaction. In some cases the butene 
produced was subsequently dehydrogenated to butadiene in a separate unit. 
 
ICI operated a plant to produce isobutene from isobutane in a UOP plant.31 
Yields of 75–80% isobutene were obtained at 30–40% conversion in a tubular 
reactor and residual isobutane was recycled. 
 
I. G. Farben also produced butene by butane dehydrogenation.32 A moving 
catalyst bed system was used in a tubular reactor. The total catalyst charge was 
1.5 tonnes with a residence time of 4 h in the tubes. Yields of 85% at 20–25% 
conversion were obtained at a liquid space velocity of 2 h−1 and 620°–650°C 
operating temperature. This was an impressive result for a new reactor design 
that has now been developed as the continuous catalyst regeneration process and 
is widely used in refineries. 
 
7.2.2. Butadiene from Butenes 
 
Butene dehydrogenation was studied extensively in Russia, Germany, and the 
United States in the 1930s, and several promising processes were selected for 
276 
Chapter 7 
 
the Rubber Reserve Company program. In all cases a steam ratio of up to 20:1 
was used during operation. The steam diluent provided several benefits by: 
• Decreasing the partial pressure of hydrocarbon and increasing equilibri-
um conversion at atmospheric pressure. 
• Acting as a heat carrier so that the feed was not directly heated to the re-
action temperature. 
• Decreasing coke deposition to extend the operating cycle. 
 
For these reasons the catalyst could be used in adiabatic beds rather than in 
tubular reactors. The inlet temperature lay in the range 600°–675°C and, more 
practically from a process point of view, the process was operated at atmospher-
ic pressure. The use of less water-sensitive catalysts also meant that regeneration 
was possible with steam rather than using air at high-temperature. 
 
A catalyst developed by the Standard Oil Development Company and first 
used in 1940 was used in six of the Government butadiene plants.33 The compo-
sition of catalyst 1707 is shown in Table 7.4. 
 
It was shown that iron oxide promoted dehydrogenation activity while pot-
ash reduced the extent of carbon deposition during operation and also assisted in 
carbon removal during regeneration. The catalyst gave 85% selectivity at 20% 
conversion. 
 
Phillips produced a bauxite catalyst containing 5% barium hydroxide that 
was later impregnated with potash. Natural bauxite always contains a significant 
amount of iron impurities, and there was probably an unexpected beneficial ef-
fect from the iron impurity. The Shell Development Company introduced an 
iron catalyst promoted with chromia and containing potash, which by this time 
was recognized as essential to reduce the effects of carbon formation.34 The 
compositions of the Shell catalyst 105 and the later Shell 205, which gradually 
replaced 1707 in wartime plants, are also shown in Table 7.4. It seems likely 
that the potash content of Shell 105 was gradually increased to 7% K2CO3.35 By

1954 the Shell catalyst 205, containing 33% potassium carbonate, became the 
preferred catalyst for butadiene production. 
 
The Shell catalysts were made by dry mixing powdered iron oxide, chromic 
acid, and potassium carbonate, mixing with water, extruding before drying, and 
then calcining at 800°–950°C. The high-temperature calcinations was critical 
and later work indicated that it optimized surface area and pore size as the iron 
oxide was converted to α-hematite. 
 
Dow introduced a calcium/nickel phosphate catalyst (see Table 7.4), which 
was used in several butene dehydrogenation units.36 It gave a better yield at a 
higher steam ratio than the other catalysts but needed to be regenerated with air 
at intervals of about 15 min to remove the carbon deposits which collected in the 
catalyst bed, not on the catalyst itself. The operating life was about seven 
months before replacement, which was much shorter than that of the other cata-
lysts. 
 
Butadiene production from these dehydrogenation processes did not contin-
ue beyond the 1960s, as butadiene from steam cracking of naphtha became 
available. Later, however, from about 1990, as butadiene and butene shortages 
developed, several commercial processes were revived. 
 
7.2.2.1. Oxidative Dehydrogenation 
 
The addition of oxygen to the butene and steam reaction mixture improves con-
version and selectivity during the dehydrogenation reaction by removing the 
hydrogen as water: 
 
 
C4H8  +  ½ O2  →  C4H6  +  H2O 
(7.25) 
 
Not only does this improve the equilibrium conversion but the exothermic oxi-
dation reaction also supplies heat to balance the endothermic dehydrogenation 
reaction. At 550°–600°C more than 90% selectivity is possible at conversions in 
the range 65–80% with steam mole ratios up to 12. Catalysts in the Petrotex 
(Mobay) process are zinc/chromium and magnesium/chromium ferrites.37 
 
7.2.3. Propylene from Propane 
 
The dehydrogenation processes used for the production of butadiene from n-
butane and n-butenes during the development of GR-S rubber were modified in 
the 1990s for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This compensated 
for the short supply of steam cracked propylene used to produce polypropylene. 
The new processes can also be used for the dehydrogenation of other paraffins. 
 
The old Houdry process has been developed by UCI/Lummus to become 
the Catofin process while Phillips and UOP have introduced their Star and Ole-
flex processes. Linde in Germany has also introduced a process. A range of dif-

ferent catalysts is used and high selectivity is achieved at fairly low conversion. 
The Phillips Star process used a promoted noble metal catalyst supported on 
zinc aluminate, which had been originally developed for light paraffin dehydro-
genation with minimum isomerization.38 The catalyst is contained in a tubular 
reformer, operating at temperatures in the range 480°–620°C and at a pressure in 
the range 1–2 bar. The space velocity ranges between 0.5–1.0 LHSV and the 
steam ratio is in the range 2–10 moles of steam per mole of hydrocarbon. The 
process suffers from the deposition of carbon, and the catalyst must be regener-
ated after an eight hour cycle. The average lifetime of the catalyst is about 1–2 
years. The selectivity to propylene is around 80–90% at a propane conversion of 
30–40%. In the case of butane, the selectivity to butene is 85–95% at a conver-
sion of 45–50%. The UOP Oleflex process uses a platinum catalyst supported on 
alumina under similar conditions and selectivity. A chromium-based catalyst is 
used in the Catofin process. A more recent process, announced by Linde in 1992 
and using a chromium/alumina catalyst developed by Engelhard, is now operat-
ing in Germany.39 The platinum catalyst, promoted with tin and supported on 
CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (derived from calcination of a mixed precursor with a hy-
drotalcite structure) is different from the early formulations. It is reduced in hy-
drogen and steam before use. High conversions and selectivities are claimed in 
operation at high temperatures with extended cycle times. 
 
7.2.4. Styrene 
 
The Naugatuck Chemical Company, Connecticut, a subsidiary of U.S. Rubber, 
was the first company to manufacture styrene. The process, however, was based 
on the hydrodechlorination of ethylbenzene and the product was not sufficiently 
pure for use in polymer applications. The company had received assistance from 
Igor Ostromisslenski, a well-known Russian emigrant, who held several patents 
in the field.40 
 
Both I. G. Farben in Germany41 and the Dow Chemical Company, Midland, 
Michigan,42 were also working, independently, on styrene and polystyrene and 
had applied for patents. By 1931 I. G. Farben were operating a 60-tonnes.day−1 
plant at Ludwigshafen and, soon afterward, Dow built a plant in the United 
States. Ethylbenzene was dehydrogenated directly to styrene in both processes, 
although different reactor designs were used. The catalysts used by I. G. Far-
ben43 and Dow44 were quite different. At first neither used potash, which is now 
known limit the degree of carbon deposition. I. G. Farben used supported zinc 
oxide whereas Dow used bauxite. The iron oxide impurity in the bauxite, as in 
the Phillips butane dehydrogenation catalyst, would have acted as a fortuitous 
catalyst promoter and is still an essential component of modern catalysts. Cata-
lyst compositions are shown in Table 7.5. 
 
Early patent literature does not always give a true idea of the process. Much 
technical information on various petrochemical processes became available in 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts

the years following World War II, when experts inspected the German chemical 
engineering and technical centers producing chemicals. The results were pub-
lished in a number of reports: 
• British teams wrote British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee Re-
ports (BIOS). 
• American teams prepared Field Information Agency Technical Reports 
(FIAT). 
• There were also Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee Re-
ports (CIOS). 
 
The German process used banks of gas-fired, copper-lined tubes, 30 ft long 
and 8 in in diameter, containing catalyst. These were heated to 610°C. The feed 
to the reactor tubes consisted of a mixture of 1.25 lb steam for every pound of 
ethylbenzene, preheated to 560°C. Up to 1941 the yield was 75% at 40% con-
version, but later the yield improved to 90%, presumably as a result of using an 
improved catalyst. The US process used a fixed bed of catalyst with 2.6-lb steam 
for every pound of ethylbenzene. Operation at 600°C gave a catalyst life of one 
year with no regeneration. As with other dehydrogenation reactions, the partial 
pressure of ethylbenzene was reduced by the addition of steam or even carbon 
dioxide. Modern processes are based on the use of isothermal tubular reactors or 
fixed bed adiabatic reactors. Unconverted ethylbenzene is recycled after the sty-
rene product is removed. When the Rubber Reserve Company authorized buta-
diene production in 1942, they also included six styrene plants, five of which 
used the Dow process. The sixth plant used a Union Carbide process. A total of 
187,500 tonnes/year of styrene was planned, based on ethylene and coal-based 
benzene. When Standard Oil introduced catalyst 1707 for butadiene production, 
it was also used to dehydrogenate ethylbenzene in the new plants. The improved 
iron oxide/chromia/ potash catalysts and Shell 105 and 205 were eventually pre-
ferred when they became available, particularly after the war. 
 
Many other iron catalyst compositions have been examined experimentally 
as the styrene process has developed.45 Chromium was replaced or combined 
with a wide range of other oxide promoters, such as copper oxide, zinc oxide, 
vanadium pentoxide, thoria, tungsten oxide, molybdena, ceria, and alkaline earth 
oxides. At the time, none was used in any full-scale process but some were later 
found to give good performances in improved plants. 
 
7.2.4.1. Ethylbenzene Production 
 
The alkylation process is the addition of an alkene to benzene, usually over an 
acidic catalyst to give the alkyl benzene. The reaction is non-selective, and poly-
alkyl benzenes are regular impurities in the crude product stream. The degree of 
polysubstitution is usually limited by controlling the ratio of reactants.

Dry benzene was alkylated with ethylene in either the liquid or gas phases 
using acidic catalysts: 
• An early liquid phase process used an aluminum trichloride catalyst at 
85°– 95°C at pressures just above atmospheric. A low ethylene/benzene 
ratio was used to limit the formation of diethylbenzene and other polyeth-
ylbenzenes. By-products could, however, be recycled with benzene and 
were recovered as ethylbenzene by transalkylation. Ethylbenzene selec-
tivity was about 94% based on benzene and higher on ethylene. The cata-
lyst that formed in solution was thought to be HAlCl4.n-C6H5C2H5, which 
gradually deactivated and was replenished as required. Other acid cata-
lysts such as boron trifluoride can be used in the liquid phase process, 
which is still widely used in older plants.

• Gas phase processes have been used and operate at 300°C and higher 
pressures up to 60 atm. The first catalysts were the typical phosphoric ac-
id/kieselguhr types (UOP Alkar process) or silica/alumina (Koppers) op-
erating with a low ethylene/benzene molar ratio (0.2). The low ratio was 
necessary to minimize by-products that could not be dealkylated by the 
catalyst. The Alkar process using boron trifluoride supported on activated 
alumina did, however, dealkylate the by-products, thus giving higher se-
lectivity at 100% ethylene conversion. It was useful for the production of 
ethylbenzene from dilute ethylene streams. 
• Since 1980 high-activity modified ZSM-5 catalysts that operate at 450°C 
and 20 atm have been used in most new plants. Capacities of up to 
800,000 tonnes/year have been possible. The catalyst is extremely active 
and forms few by-products or coke-forming polymers. Capital costs for 
equipment are lower and the use of highly corrosive catalysts is avoided. 
 
7.2.4.2. Styrene Production after 1950 
 
Although the use of dehydrogenation processes to supply butadiene declined as 
the more economical supplies from steam cracking of naphtha were introduced, 
the production of styrene from ethylbenzene dehydrogenation has been continu-
ously developed, since styrene is not available in sufficient quantities as a by-
product. 
 
From about 1950, Shell 205 and similar catalysts based on alkalized iron 
and chromium oxides were used exclusively for styrene production. As plant 
capacities were rapidly expanded, efforts were increased to improve the perfor-
mance of the catalyst. Higher potash levels were introduced46 and cement bind-
ers were used to increase strength and selectivity.47 Ethylbenzene conversion, 
which was still about 30–50% in the 1950’s, was increased to at least 60% by 
1960. Better plant designs were developed and reactors with up to three beds 
were introduced. One of the first higher selectivity catalysts included vanadium 
pentoxide with the conventional chromium oxide and potash.48 Improvements 
often led to different catalysts being used in a single reactor to optimize opera-
tion. 
 
The energy crisis of the 1970s made it even more important to reduce costs 
and make the process more efficient. Selectivity was increased even further by a 
new catalyst, in which a combination of molybdenum oxide and cerium oxide 
together with a cement binder replaced the chromium oxide completely. It was 
still necessary to reduce fuel costs and operators began to conserve energy by 
lowering the steam ratio during operation. Under these conditions chromium 
promoters were still effective, and as the steam ratio decreased, chromium-
promoted catalysts, particularly those with high potash content and cement 
binders, operated with a much lower level of deactivation for longer periods 
than the new chrome-free catalysts. High-potash chromia catalysts operated at a 
282 
Chapter 7 
 
steam mole ratio as low as 3:1, while catalysts containing mixed chromium, 
ceria, and molybdenum promoters, together with potash, were more selective 
but had to be operated at steam ratios of about 7:1.50 
 
Increased efforts during the 1970s led to a rapid increase in the availability 
of catalysts containing various promoters and different potash contents. One 
supplier estimated that some 12–15 catalysts were available for both isothermal 
and adiabatic reactors operating at both high and low steam ratios.51 This was 
partly because so many different processes were used and every operator proba-
bly had a favorite type of catalyst! It was still possible, however, to choose cata-
lysts for both isothermal and adiabatic plants that had either a high selectivity 
and good activity at a moderate steam ratio or a high activity and long life at a 
higher steam ratio. 
 
7.2.4.3. Styrene Plant Operation 
 
The dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene is endothermic so that heat must be sup-
plied during operation. The two commercial styrene processes either incorporate 
several adiabatic beds with interbed heat exchange/steam addition or isothermal 
tubular reactors with a suitable heating medium in order to maintain operating 
temperature.52 
 
Carbon deposition and dealkylation reactions are both inhibited by the addi-
tion of potash to the catalyst. The equilibrium of the forward reaction is favored 
by high temperature and low operating pressures. A high proportion of super-
heated steam is also added to the ethyl benzene feed for the following reasons: 
• Provide heat for the process. 
• Reduce the partial pressure of ethylbenzene. 
• Inhibit the formation of undesirable carbon deposits. 
• Prevent reduction of magnetite to metallic iron. 
 
After charging to the reactor, the catalyst is carefully heated, first in nitro-
gen and then in steam, to about 540°C, before ethylbenzene is admitted to the 
reactor. A high steam ratio is maintained for several days to activate the catalyst. 
During the activation period, the α-haematite (α-Fe2O3) component of the cata-
lyst is reduced to magnetite (Fe3O4) and selectivity increases to a maximum 
during a period of two to three days. The level of conversion is maintained by 
controlling the temperature of the catalyst or by increasing the steam ratio. The 
presence of chloride in the feedstock or in the steam leads to an irreversible poi-
soning of the catalyst. Sulfur compounds also act as poisons, but the activity of 
the catalyst does recover when the sulfur contamination is removed from the 
feedstock. Operating conditions are summarized in Table 7.5. 
 
Some catalysts can catalyze the dealkylation of the ethyl benzene to eth-
ylene and benzene, as well as the required dehydrogenation reaction to give sty-
rene and hydrogen. This undesirable reaction can be suppressed by allowing a 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts 
283 
 
small amount of carbon or coke to deposit on the catalyst surface. However, an 
excessive level of carbon deposition also inhibits the required dehydrogenation 
reaction. When this occurs, some of the carbon can be removed, and activity for 
hydrogenation restored, by treating the catalyst with superheated steam. If the 
conditions under which the catalyst is steamed lead to conversion of the potassi-
um carbonate to the hydroxide, the catalyst selectivity decreases and potassium 
hydroxide, which is volatile, is slowly lost. Catalyst life is usually less than two 
years. 
 
7.2.4.4. Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation (Styrene) Catalysts 
 
Catalysts require a high thermal stability to maintain the required surface area 
and pore size at the high operating temperature and steam ratio.52 The composi-
tion of the catalyst is quite similar to the high-temperature-shift catalyst used in 
the manufacturing of ammonia, which is operated at much lower temperatures 
and which often loses strength when exposed to potassium compounds which 
have migrated from the reforming stages of the process. Perhaps for this reason, 
hydraulic cements have often been used to bind styrene catalysts and improve 
physical strength. Catalysts have been made by wet mixing of the components to 
form a paste. 
 
Early catalysts were produced from calcined ferric oxide, potassium car-
bonate, a binder when required, and usually chromium oxide. Subsequently a 
wide range of other oxides replaced the chromium oxide;51,52 typical composi-
tions are shown in Table 7.5. The paste was extruded or granulated to produce a 
suitable shape and then calcined at a high temperature in the range 900°–950°C. 
Solid solutions of α-hematite and chromium oxide (the active catalyst precur-
sors) were formed and these also contained potassium carbonate to inhibit coke 
formation. Catalyst surface area and pore volume were controlled by calcination 
conditions. It has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies that α-hematite is 
reduced to magnetite and that there is some combination of potash and the 
chromium oxide stabilizer. There is little change in the physical properties of the 
catalyst during reduction and subsequent operation. 
 
Catalyst activity and selectivity, at high or low steam ratios, can be con-
trolled by selection of both the stabilizers and the calcination temperature. 
7.3. SYNTHETIC FIBERS 
The production of nylons and polyesters, which were first synthesized in the 
1930s, has led to the development of man-made fibers. The complex sequence 
of catalytic reactions involved in both processes was originally based on 1930s 
technology but, as the reaction mechanisms came to be understood, catalysts 
were improved and, in some cases, new petrochemical feeds were introduced. 
284 
Chapter 7 
 
Acrylic fibers based on acrylonitrile were then developed from about the 1940’s 
and, although not as widely used as polyesters and nylons, have many applica-
tions. 
 
It is shown in Table 7.6 how synthetic man-made fibers are replacing the 
viscose and acetate rayons produced from natural cotton fibers or wood pulp. 
During 1970 the production of cellulose fibers was 43% of world fiber output, 
but by 2000 the proportion had fallen to only 8%. Cellulose fiber production fell 
from 3.6 to less than 2.5 million tonnes during the same period. Polyester fiber 
dominates the market and far exceeds the use of nylon 66, nylon 6, and acrylic 
fibers. In 1993 man-made synthetic fiber production was about 17.5 million 
tonnes while man-made cellulose fiber production was about 2.5 million tonnes. 
At the same time about 15.5 million tonnes of natural cotton was used.53 
 
7.3.1. Nylon 66 
 
Wallace Carothers began his work on polymerization in 1928 at the DuPont 
laboratories. By 1930, he had found that aliphatic polyesters, formed by the 
condensation of dihydric alcohols and dicarboxylic acids, could be drawn into 
threads when melted. 
 
Most of the polyesters he investigated, however, had low melting points and 
were too soluble in water for use as textiles, although polyamides were more 
promising. To form useful fibers, the polymer needs to have a molecular weight 
in the range12,000–20,000. When amino acids were briefly investigated, those 
with fewer than five carbon atoms condensed to form lactams, together with a 
low-molecular-weight polymer. Carothers then assumed that only those amino 
acids containing more than seven carbon atoms would be able to produce useful 
polymers. These were difficult to synthesize, so he concentrated on the range of 
polyamides produced from diamines and dicarboxylic acids. He selected adipic 
acid and hexamethylene diamines for his work because cyclohexane was readily 
available and could be used as the raw material for conversion to both interme-
diates. The polymer produced from the two C6 molecules formed good fibers

and production of nylon 66 began in 1938.54 The term nylon 66 is derived from 
the fact that the diamine and the dicarboxylic acid both contain 6 carbon atoms. 
 
7.3.1.1. Production of Nylon Intermediates 
 
During the early years of nylon 66 production, cyclohexane was obtained by 
distillation from some natural gasolines, together with isomerization of the small 
volumes of methyl cyclopentane also present. In other parts of the world and as 
the demand for nylon fibers and resins increased, benzene became the major 
source of cyclohexane. 
 
Sulfur-free benzene can be converted to cyclohexane by hydrogenation in a 
two stage process. Approximately 95% of the benzene in a circulating liquid 
phase is converted in the first reactor using a simple Raney nickel catalyst at 
temperatures less than 230°C and at pressures up to 50 bar. The catalyst also 
acts as a sulfur guard. Temperature control is achieved largely by relying on the 
latent heat of evaporation of cyclohexane. It is important to avoid isomerization 
to methyl cyclopentane. A second reactor with a fixed catalyst bed of nickel 
supported on kieselguhr or alumina, operating in the vapor phase at 200°–225°C 
and 50 bar, completes the benzene conversion. 
 
7.3.1.2. Adipic Acid 
 
The first stage in the production of adipic acid is the oxidation of liquid cyclo-
hexane with air using a cobalt naphthenate catalyst at temperatures in the range 
at 140°–160°C and pressures about 8–12 bar. A mixed ketone/alcohol oil con-
taining cyclohexanol (C6H11OH) and cyclohexanone (C6H10O) (KA oil) is pro-
duced at up to 85% selectivity, with the ketone/alcohol ratio of about 1:1. The 
conversion is only about 10% and unconverted cyclohexane is recycled. The 
process was improved by Bashkirov by the additions up to 5% boric acid to the 
cyclohexane and by restricting the oxygen content of the air to about 4%. The 
overall yield was increased to more than 90% and conversion to more than 12%. 
The ketone/alcohol ratio was decreased to 1:9. 
 
The ketone/alcohol oil was then oxidized further to adipic acid in a 60% 
nitric acid solution with an ammonium metavanadate/copper nitrate catalyst at 
50°–80°C. Selectivity to adipic acid was more than 95%. A second air oxidation 
process at 80°–85°C and 6 bar has since been developed. By using a copper ace-
tate/manganese acetate catalyst in acetic acid solution, the process has the ad-
vantage of avoiding the use of the strongly corrosive nitric acid: 
 
 
 C6H11OH  +  4 O(HNO3)  →  COOH(CH2)4COOH  +  H2O 
(7.26) 
 
 
 
  
C6H10O  +  3 O(HNO3)  →  COOH(CH2)4COOH 
(7.27) 
 
286 
Chapter 7 
 
 
Pure cyclohexanol can also be obtained by the hydrogenation of phenol 
with a palladium catalyst at 150°C and 10 atm although the process is not widely 
used. Attempts were made by BASF to synthesize adipic acid from butadiene 
via a two-step carbonylation process in the presence of methanol. The first step 
of the synthesis operated at 130°C and 600 bar while the second operated at 
170°C and a lower pressure of 160 bar. A typical cobalt catalyst with organic 
ligands was used, but the process was never developed industrially. 
 
Phenol produced by the cumene–phenol process is relatively expensive but 
Solutia has recently claimed a new process developed in Russia.55 Benzene is 
oxidized directly to phenol using nitrous oxide. Phenol is then converted to adip-
ic acid by oxidature procedures. Nitrous oxide from the final nitric acid oxida-
tion to adipic acid is recycled to the first stage. This has been reported as the 
first new commercial technology since DuPont introduced the direct hydrocya-
nation of butadiene to adiponitrile in 1971. 
 
7.3.1.3. Hexamethylenediamine 
 
The manufacture of hexamethylenediamine is usually a two stage process. In the 
first stage, adiponitrile is produced, and in the second stage, adiponitrile is hy-
drogenated to hexamethylenediamine. Adiponitrile has been manufactured, in 
the main, from three feedstocks, and these will be described briefly in turn. 
 
In the first process adipic acid was converted to adiponitrile by a high tem-
perature reaction with ammonia over a boron phosphate catalyst at temperatures 
in the range 300–350◦C. The process was thought to proceed via the formation 
of diammonium adipate, followed by dehydration to adiponitrile: 
 
 
 COOH-(CH2)4-COOH + 2 NH3 → COONH4(CH2)4-COONH4 
(7.28) 
 
 
COONH4(CH2)4-COONH4 → NC(CH2)4CN + 4 H2O 
(7.29) 
 
The selectivity to adiponitrile was about 80% in the early reactors.  
 
The main problem with this reaction is that adipic acid in the liquid phase is 
thermally unstable and degrades to a carbon-rich, hard, resinous product. The 
vapor is rather more thermally stable at a similar temperature, but at higher tem-
peratures also degrades to similar products. The overall reaction producing adi-
ponitrile from adipic acid is very endothermic, and the reaction mixture is sub-
jected to a significant measure of cooling due to this process. Thus, while all of 
the reaction components were initially in the gas phase this cooling result in the 
condensation of some liquid adipic acid, which then proceeds to degrade to the 
polymeric resin described above. The reactor tubes regularly become blocked 
with catalyst and polymeric resin, thus preventing flow of reactants through the 
reactor. At this stage, the reactor must be taken out of service, so that the poly-
meric resins can be drilled out of the reactor, and the catalyst replenished.  Selec-

tivity could be increased to 90% by converting the adipic acid to adiponitrile in a 
fluid bed with a phosphoric acid/kieselguhr catalyst that was continuously re-
generated during operation. 
 
As the demand for nylon increased during the 1950s and 1960s, an alterna-
tive, more readily available feedstock was sought for the production of adiponi-
trile.  In this way more adipic acid would be released for the production of nylon 
salt. Consequently, by the 1960’s, an alternative route to the production of adi-
ponitrile using butadiene as the raw material was sought, either by direct or indi-
rect hydrocyanation. The indirect route proceeded via chlorination with no cata-
lyst, at 200°–300°C, followed by the replacement of chlorine with cyanide to 
produce a mixture of dicyanobutene isomers. The mixture was isomerized to the 
required 1,4-dicyano-2-butene by a copper complex in a reaction mixture con-
taining hydrogen cyanide. Adiponitrile was formed by gas phase hydrogenation 
at 300°C using a palladium catalyst. 
 
The direct addition of chlorine to butadiene followed by reaction with sodi-
um cyanide is a very unattractive process. Both chlorine and sodium cyanide are 
very expensive to produce in terms of energy required, and then to be left with 
the problem of disposal of contaminated sodium chloride residues only serves to 
compound the problem. The direct addition of hydrogen cyanide to butadiene is 
much more attractive, provided that the addition reactions can be tailored to 
produce the desired linear product. The problems were solved by some excellent 
work by scientists from du Pont.56,57 The chemistry of the process can be envis-
aged in three stages. In the first stage, one molecule of hydrogen cyanide adds 
across one of the double bonds to give a mixture of linear and branched nitriles. 
In the second stage, the branched isomer is isomerized to the linear form, and in 
the third stage, the second molecule of hydrogen cyanide adds across the re-
maining double bond to give adiponitrile: 
 
    CH2=CH.CH=CH2  +  HCN  →    
(7.30) 
                                          CH2=CH.CH2CH2CN  +  CH2=CH.CH(CN).CH3 
 
 
  
CH2=CH.CH(CN)CH3  →  CH2=CH.CH2CH2CN 
(7.31) 
 
 
  
CH2=CH.CH2CH2CN  +  HCN  →  NC(CH2)4CN 
(7.32) 
 
The catalyst is similar for all three steps, and consists of a zero valent nickel 
phosphite complex, promoted with zinc or aluminium chlorides. The direct addi-
tion of hydrogen cyanide to butadiene is particularly attractive with the availa-
bility of by-product hydrogen cyanide form the manufacture of acrylonitrile by 
the ammoxidation of propylene. 
 
The third of the potential feedstocks for the manufacture of adiponitrile is 
acrylonitrile, prepared by the ammoxidation of propylene. The only route to 
288 
Chapter 7 
 
have been commercialized to date is the non-catalytic electrodimerization pro-
cess, as first used by Monsanto, and now by BASF: 
 
 
  
2 CH2=CHCN  +  2 H+  +  2 e–  →  NC(CH2)4CN 
(7.33) 
 
The reaction probably proceeds via the formation of a dianion by electron trans-
fer from an acrylonitrile molecule followed by combination with a second mole-
cule and proton addition from a water molecule. 
 
Two rather different approaches to the catalytic dimerisation of acrylonitrile 
have also been explored. In the first approach, a ruthenium catalyst was used in 
the presence of hydrogen, at temperatures in the range 200–350°C and pressures 
of 1–3 bar. Adiponitrile58 was produced directly, but unfortunately, was accom-
panied by an equimolar amount of propionitrile, formed by direct hydrogenation 
of the acrylonitrile: 
 
 
  
2 CH2=CH.CN  +  H2  →  NC(CH2)4CN 
(7.34) 
 
 
  
CH2=CH.CN  +  H2  →  CH3CH2CN 
(7.35) 
 
 It was not possible to eliminate the formation of the propionitrile and the cost of 
converting the propionitrile to useful products was such that work on this route 
was discontinued. 
 
In the second approach, trivalent organophosphorus derivatives were used. 
The main reaction product was α-methyleneglutaronitrile, which was not a use-
ful product, and which could not easily be converted to linear from. In subse-
quent work at ICI,59 a range of arylphosphonite and diarylphosphinite catalysts 
were developed, which under rigorously anhydrous conditions, and in isopropa-
nol solution, gave essentially linear dimer60 at a good rate at temperatures as low 
as 60°C. This process was developed successfully through the pilot plant stages, 
but work was eventually terminated when ICI withdrew from the nylon business 
for strategic commercial reasons. 
 
Adiponitrile can be hydrogenated in the liquid phase, at about 99% selectiv-
ity, to produce hexamethylene diamine at pressures as low as 30 atm using nick-
el catalysts containing iron or cobalt at about 75°C. New routes to HMD are 
being developed by major producers.61 Adiponitrile was easily hydrogenated to 
HMD, at pressures up to 600 atm, with a cobalt oxide catalyst containing small 
amounts of silica and titania. Hydrogenation at 300–350 atm was also possible 
with iron catalysts. 
 
7.3.1.4. Nylon Polymer 
 
Adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine are mixed in either a water or methanol 
solution, where they form the salt, known as nylon salt, which crystallizes as

hexamethylene diammonium adipamide. The nylon salt is then heated to tem-
peratures of 250°–270°C to eliminate water and hence form the polymer. Care is 
needed to control the dehydration conditions, to produce the optimum chain 
length and molecular weight. Acetic acid can be added to control chain termina-
tion. 
 
7.3.2. Nylon 6 
 
Nylon was such a success that other companies already working on polymeriza-
tion began to search for competitive polyamides not covered by the DuPont pa-
tents. Paul Schleck of I.G. Farben quickly developed a type of nylon based on 
ε−caprolactam.62 The pure dry ε-caprolactam was difficult to polymerize, but the 
problem was solved by the addition of catalytic amounts of an acid and water. 
Production details were soon developed. Production of polycaprolactam (trade-
mark Perlon L) began in 1940. Nylons based on ε-caprolactam were soon being 
produced by many other companies because after the war, details of the process 
were released as intelligence reports and were free of patent restrictions.63 
 
The DuPont polymer then became known as nylon 66 because it was made 
from two C6 monomers, while the I.G. Farben polymer, from a single C6 mono-
mer, was nylon 6.  
 
7.3.2.1. Caprolactam 
 
The preparation of ε-caprolactam via the Beckman rearrangement of cyclohexa-
none oxime was first described by Wallach in 1900.64 In the I.G. Farben process, 
phenol was hydrogenated to cyclohexanol, at 140°–160°C and 15 bar, with a 
nickel oxide/silica catalyst. The cyclohexanol was dehydrogenated to cyclohex-
anone using a zinc/iron catalyst at 400°C, and the cyclohexanone oxime was 
formed by reaction with hydroxylamine monosulfonate. Conversion to cyclo-
hexanone oxime was maximized at pH 7 by neutralizing the solution with am-
monia. The organic layer of crude oxime was crystallized and then isomerized to 
ε-caprolactam with 20% oleum at 120°C. ε-Caprolactam was purified and the 
ammonium sulfate recovered. 
 
The basic industrial process is still essentially the same except that cyclo-
hexane is now used to provide more than 60% of the ε-caprolactam produced, 
with phenol used for the balance. BASF switched to cyclohexane in feedstock 
1963. A big disadvantage of the process has been the need to sell about 2.3 lb of 
by-product ammonium sulfate for every pound of ε−caprolactam produced, that 
is, about 5 kg of ammonium sulfate for each kilogram of ε- caprolactam. How-
ever, there is a ready market for ammonium sulphate in the fertilizer business.

7.3.2.2. Cyclohexanone 
 
Cyclohexanone was recovered from ketone/alcohol oil by distillation and then 
dehydrogenating the remaining cyclohexanol using copper oxide/zinc oxide 
catalysts at 400°–450°C, with about 90% conversion and 95% selectivity. 
 
The original preparation of cyclohexanone from phenol by hydrogenation to 
cyclohexanol followed by dehydrogenation has since been improved. Selective 
hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone is possible using a palladium catalyst 
at 140°–170°C and 1–2 atm. An Allied/Vickers–Zimmer catalyst contained 0.5–
5% palladium, supported on a low-surface-area calcium aluminate which con-
tained about 8–9% calcium oxide.65 
 
7.3.2.3. Cyclohexanone Oxime 
 
Cyclohexanone reacts with hydroxylamine sulfate in the presence of ammonia, 
to produce the oxime with an equivalent of by-product ammonium sulfate. The 
number of steps required to form hydroxylamine sulfate complicates the proce-
dure, and also gave rise to some further by-product ammonium sulphate. 
 
In the DSM HPO process, nitrate ions are reduced to hydroxylamine using a 
palladium/carbon catalyst in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution. It was possi-
ble to prepare cyclohexanone oxime by a process involving the extraction of 
cyclohexanone from solution in toluene, into an immiscible aqueous solution of 
hydroxylamine in a two phase liquid reactor. The spent solution was then recy-
cled with added nitric acid to the reduction step and sulfate production was elim-
inated: 
 
 
  
NO3
-  +  H+  +  3H2  →  NH2OH  +  2H2O 
(7.36) 
 
 
  
C6H10O  +  NH2OH  →  C6H10(OH)NHOH 
(7.37) 
 
 
Further efforts to decrease by-product sulfate led to investigation of oxime 
production from cyclohexanone by one step ammoxidation reactions. Ammoxi-
dation catalysts are usually unstable (phosphotungstates) or relatively inactive 
(silica), but a more efficient catalyst was introduced by Montedipe (now Eni-
chem) in 1986.66 This was based on a titanium silicalite catalyst with a sili-
ca/titania molar ratio greater than 30:1. Reaction took place with a hydrogen 
peroxide oxidant, in tertiary butanol as solvent at 70°–90°C. Although the con-
version was almost 100% giving selectivity greater than 98%, ammoxidation has 
not been used commercially. The photochemical reaction of benzene with nitro-
syl chloride, NOCl, has also been investigated in Japan, as an alternative route to 
cyclohexane oxime.

7.3.2.4. Snia-Viscosa Process 
 
Snia-Viscosa developed an ε−caprolactam process in 1958 based on the use of 
toluene as the raw material,67 which was licensed in 1962. The oxidation of tolu-
ene has been studied since at least 1892,68 when the first products obtained were 
benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. Catalysts based on platinum,69 vanadium pent-
oxide, and various other oxides70 have been described: 
 
  
 
 
  
C6H5.CH3  +  3/2 O2  →  C6H5.COOH  +  H2O 
(7.38) 
 
 
  
C6H5.COOH  +  3 H2  →  C6H11.COOH 
(7.39) 
 
 
Weiss and Downs71 described the use of vanadium pentoxide for the cata-
lytic oxidation of toluene and naphthalene. Subsequently, Craver72 suggested a 
mixed oxide catalyst derived from uranium oxide and molybdenum trioxide in 
molar ratios ranging from 3-13:1. Copper oxide was also suggested as a possible 
promoter. When using the vanadium pentoxide catalyst, benzoic acid was the 
main product at temperatures below 400°C, with some benzaldehyde formed at 
higher temperatures. Selectivity was only about 50% at 5% conversion. 
 
The Snia-Viscosa process now uses benzoic acid as an intermediate in ca-
prolactam production. The oxidation of toluene in the liquid phase is still used in 
modern processes, with selectivity greater than 90%, at about 30% conversion. 
Typical operating conditions are at temperatures around 140°C, and pressures in 
the range 8–10 bar, using a cobalt acetate catalyst. 
 
The benzoic acid is now hydrogenated to cyclohexane carboxylic acid with 
a palladium/carbon catalyst at 170°C and 10–19 bar, whereas originally a nickel 
catalyst was used. Reaction with nitrosyl sulfuric acid in oleum solution at 80°C 
then gives ε-caprolactam. In the original Snia-Viscosa process, about 25% more 
ammonium sulfate was formed than in the conventional process. However, sol-
vent extraction of the caprolactam from the acid solution using alkyl phenols 
does avoid the production of the ammonium salt. 
 
7.3.2.5. Conversion of Cyclohexanone Oxime to Caprolactam 
 
Conversion of the oxime to caprolactam was achieved by mixing the oxime with 
an equal weight of 20% oleum at a temperature of 120°C. After 15 minutes, the 
yield of ε-caprolactam was about 90%. The solution was neutralized with am-
monia and the crude lactam separated recovered and purified by distillation. 
 
In the DSM process, ammonium sulfate formation is reduced from about 5 
kg for each kilogram of caprolactam to 1.8 kg. Boric acid catalysts can be used 
for the rearrangement of the oxime to the lactam at 330°C in fixed or fluidized 
beds, but have not been used commercially. Strong acid exchange resins have 
292 
Chapter 7 
 
also been tested in a modified Beckman rearrangement using dimethylsulfoxide 
solutions at 100°C. 
 
7.3.2.6. Caprolactam from Butadiene 
 
The DuPont direct hydrocyanation of butadiene process for the production of 
hexamethylene diamine can also be adapted for the production of caprolactam. 
Partial hydrogenation of the adiponitrile intermediate in which only one cyanide 
group is converted to the amine, followed by hydrolysis of the remaining cya-
nide group and ring closure can produce ε-caprolactam.73 The process has not 
been developed commercially. It is also possible that a two-stage butadiene car-
bonylation process to produce caprolactam, developed by DSM and Shell, may 
be further developed. 
 
Caprolactam is polymerized to produce nylon 6 by opening the ring with 
high 
temperature 
water 
at 
250°–280°C 
to 
give 
ω-amino 
acid 
[NH2(CH2)4COOH]. The amino acid can later react with either a second acid 
molecule or a caprolactam molecule. Temperature control and the water content 
of the mixture are important parameters during the polymerization process. 
 
7.3.3. Polyesters 
 
As a result of the DuPont patents for nylon, in 1937 Whinfield and Dickson, of 
the Calico Printers’ Association in England, became interested in polyesters 
based on aromatic dicarboxylic acids and ethylene glycol. Carothers had, of 
course, abandoned his own early work following the disappointing results with 
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Whinfield and Dickson quickly produced a long-
chain polyester and decided to patent the discovery, which was eventually li-
censed to ICI. The patent was actually granted in 1941 and ICI built the first 
commercial production unit in late 1954.74 
 
By 1946 the ICI polyester technology had already been licensed to DuPont 
and interest in the new material was on the rise. However, there were severe 
practical difficulties in obtaining the almost insoluble terephthalic acid of suffi-
cient purity from the oxidation of p-xylene, without first preparing and convert-
ing the p-toluic acid to the methyl ester. Direct oxidation of p-xylene with air 
was later developed, although complete oxidation remained a problem until Sci-
entific Design and Amoco introduced the use of bromine as a cocatalyst in con-
junction with manganese or cobalt salts. Ethylene glycol has remained the most 
widely used alcohol. 
 
Polyethylene terephthalate, or polyester, has become the most widely used 
synthetic fiber, particularly when combined with cotton. It is also a very popular 
thermoplastic resin for bottle and film production and new polyesters are now 
being developed. Thermosetting unsaturated polyesters are based on maleic an-
hydride with a range of glycols. Polyethylene terephthalate is produced from 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts 
293 
 
ethylene glycol, obtained by the direct oxidation of ethylene, and terephthalic 
acid is obtained by oxidizing paraxylene. By the year 2000 almost 20 million 
tonnes were being produced annually throughout the world.75 
 
7.3.3.1. Paraxylene 
 
The main source of mixed xylenes is either the product from catalytic reformers 
or pyrolysis gasoline. The proportion of ortho-, meta-, and paraxylenes is in the 
ratio 1:2:1 in both reformate and pyrolysis gasoline. However, reformate aro-
matics contain less than 20% ethylbenzene, whereas pyrolysis gasoline aromat-
ics contains up to 50%. Ethylbenzene and o-xylene can be separated from the 
mixture by fractional distillation, while p-xylene is separated by a zeolite ad-
sorption process. The remaining fraction, which is largely the unwanted m-
xylene, is usually isomerized with a catalyst to produce an equilibrium mixture 
of the three isomers. This corresponds, approximately, to the 1:2:1, o-, m-, p 
ratio in the original aromatic mixtures, depending on the isomerization tempera-
ture. In Table 7.7, typical catalysts and operating conditions for processes that 
have been used commercially are shown. 
 
The early silica/alumina catalysts for the isomerization of xylene suffered 
from deactivation due to the deposition of carbon and the needed frequent re-
generation. The process was improved by both the use of catalysts impregnated 
with platinum and the addition of hydrogen to the reactants, and thus led to a 
reduction in the need for frequent regeneration. These catalysts also converted 
ethyl benzene to xylenes. High-silica zeolites are now used to produce most of 
the p-xylene obtained by isomerization, because high selectivity can be achieved 
of equilibrium conversion. Mobil ZSM-5 is particularly useful because the pore 
size promotes paraselectivity and controls the unwanted disproportionation reac-

tions that produce trimethyl benzenes. Control of p-xylene isomerization within 
the zeolite pores can lead to higher than equilibrium yields of the p-xylene. Zeo-
lites are more resistant to poisons, and do not require frequent regeneration. 
 
7.3.3.2. Terephthalic Acid 
 
The range of catalysts and manner in which the air oxidation of p-xylene to ter-
ephthalic acid has developed since the first plant started operation during the 
1950s are shown in Table 7.8. The original oxidation of p-xylene using nitric 
acid as oxidant, which led to nitrogen impurities in the product, soon became 
obsolete. Direct oxidation with air was then developed using homogeneous cata-
lysts in the liquid phase. The oxidation of p-xylene produced p-toluic acid but 
was not able to produce terephthalic acid directly: 
 
 
 p-C6H4(CH3)2  +  3O2(HNO3)  →  p-C6H4(COOH)2  +  2H2O 
(7.40)

p-OOCH2.C6H4.COOH  →  p-C6H4(COOH)2 
(7.43) 
 
 
At first, the p-toluic acid was esterified with methanol in a separate step before 
final oxidation to monomethyl terephthalic acid. Alternatively, if methanol was 
used as a solvent for the p-xylene, both methyl groups were esterified in a single 
step, if the residence time was longer than 20 h. The reaction mechanism in-
volved the conversion of the methyl group to a benzyl radical by reaction with 
trivalent cobalt ions. The benzyl radical then reacts with oxygen and forms a 
peroxy species that decomposes to the oxidation product. Trivalent cobalt ions 
are regenerated as aldehydes from the peroxy or hydroperoxy species. 
 
The purification of terephthalic acid is complicated because it does not melt 
and, as it was not soluble in either water or other solvents, it could not be crys-
tallized. On the other hand, the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid could be easi-
ly crystallized from methanol or xylene. When the Mid Century Process was 
introduced by Scientific Design and Amoco in 1956, it became possible to pro-
duce and purify terephthalic acid directly. This process used air oxidation condi-
tions similar to those for previous processes, with a mixed trivalent cobalt and 
manganese acetate catalyst in glacial acetic acid, but introduced an ammonium 
bromide cocatalyst in conjunction with tetrabromomethane. Cobalt or molyb-
denum bromides or hydrobromic acid have also been used, and following reac-
tion with the trivalent cobalt, provided a source of bromine free radicals. The 
free radicals activated the methyl groups of the p-xylene and led to the for-

mation of aromatic aldehydes.76 These were converted to the acids via the per-
oxy intermediates. A further novelty of the process was the purification of prod-
uct by dissolving it at high pressure in water at 225°–275°C, and then hydrogen-
ating any 4-carboxybenzaldehyde by-product to p-toluic acid with a palladi-
um/carbon catalyst before allowing the terephthalic acid to crystallize. The same 
process was used to oxidize toluene to benzoic acid in the Snia-Viscosa capro-
lactam process. The Amoco process has been widely licensed and now produces 
the bulk of the terephthalic acid used in polyester manufacture. Terephthalic 
acid is preferable to dimethylterephthalate in polyester production because the 
reaction rate is faster and a better yield is obtained. The use of methanol is also 
avoided. 
 
The polyester polymer is produced in two steps to avoid side reactions. The 
acid is esterified in an excess of ethylene glycol at 100°–150°C and 10–70 bar 
using a cobalt or zinc acetate catalyst. The monomer then condenses at 150°–
270°C as a liquid melt under vacuum using an antimony oxide catalyst. Ethylene 
oxide is removed by distillation as the polymerization proceeds. The use of an-
timony oxide catalyst always led to a slightly grey-colored product, as a result of 
reduction of some of the antimony to the metallic state. Pure white polymer 
could be obtained by the use of germanium dioxide catalyst, but the problem 
was the very high cost of germanium relative to antimony. This problem was 
solved in ICI by W Hewertson with the addition of phosphine oxide ligands to 
the catalyst, which stabilized the antimony towards reduction. However, as is 
often the case in production, the more stable catalyst could be operated at a 
296 
Chapter 7 
 
higher temperature than the conventional catalyst. This led to shorter polymeri-
zation times, and hence an increase in plant capacity, but at the expense of re-
turning to the slightly grey polymer! The operator then had a choice between 
pure white polymer or an increase in total production. 
 
A relatively low-molecular-weight polymer is produced and generally used 
to make fibers and other products. The higher-molecular-weight polymer needed 
for bottles or packaging is formed by further polymerization in the solid state.77 
 
7.3.3.3. Alternative Routes for Terephthalic Acid Production 
 
Other syntheses for terephthalic acid have been developed, although none has 
yet been used extensively. As with most chemical processes, the capital cost of 
new equipment usually means that modifications to existing processes are more 
easily adopted than completely different routes to the same product. 
 
In the Henkel process, dipotassium phthalate can be isomerized to dipotas-
sium terephthalate at about 430°C and 5–20 bar using carbon dioxide with a 
soluble organic zinc or cadmium salt. An alternative approach is the dispropor-
tionation of potassium benzoate to give dipotassium terephthalate and benzene 
using zinc or cadmium benzoates at up to 50 bar pressure of carbon dioxide. In 
both operations the potassium is recycled by reaction with either phthalic anhy-
dride or benzoic acid. 
 
In a process developed by Lummus, p-xylene and ammonia are converted to 
terephthalonitrile in a fluidized bed at 450°C. A supported vanadium pentoxide 
catalyst is used and gives about 50% conversion. The vanadium pentoxide is 
reduced during the reaction and can be reoxidized with air in a separate reactor. 
The dinitrile is then hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid. The process has not been 
used in polyester production, although a similar process used in Japan produces 
diamines from terephthalonitrile or isophthalonitriles. 
 
7.3.3.4. Use of Polyesters 
 
Polyesters are widely used as fibers, although the market share of fibers fell 
from more than 70% before 1995 to about 60% by 2000, as demand for polyes-
ter (PET) bottles increased. To cope with the increased demand for bottles since 
1995 more isophthalic acid is being used as a copolymer with ethylene glycol. 
At the same time, naphthalene dicarboxylate (NDC) has been used to produce a 
new polyester known as polyethylene terenaphthalate (PEN).78 The new polyes-
ter bottles, although originally very expensive, have lowered gas permeability 
and are stronger and more heat resistant. Nevertheless, as prices fall, the demand 
for all types of polyester will continue to rise.

7.4. HYDROFORMYLATION AND CARBONYLATION 
Otto Roelen began studies on the OXO reaction in 1938, when he was working 
on the Fischer–Tropsch reaction with Ruhrchemie AG in Germany.79 He discov-
ered the presence of oxygenated organic compounds in the Fischer–Tropsch 
paraffin waxes and concluded that they were the result of carbonylation and hy-
drogenation of the unsaturated hydrocarbons present in the feed gases: 
 
 
 
 
This idea was confirmed by studies on the reaction of ethylene with synthe-
sis gas, (H2 + CO), at 150°–200°C and 150 bar using the standard Fischer–
Tropsch cobalt catalyst. Reaction products included propanaldehyde and isopro-
panaldehyde. In 1945 Ruhrchemie opened a plant with a capacity of 10,000 
tonnes/year at Holten, to produce C11–C17 alcohols from Fischer–Tropsch ole-
fins.80 These were subsequently converted to detergent sulfates. 
 
Other companies, including ICI in the United Kingdom, Shell in Holland, 
and the Enjay Chemical Company in the United States investigated the process 
from 1947 onwards and full-scale manufacture soon followed, often in redun-
dant high-pressure coal hydrogenation equipment.81 By 1963 this had led to a 
worldwide production of more than 500,000 tonnes/year, mainly as butanols and 
C7–C10 alcohols. The process, also known as hydroformylation, gave a mixture 
of normal and isoalcohols, after hydrogenation of the initial carbonylation alde-
hydes. Some alcohols were formed during hydroformylation together with small 
amounts of paraffins and heavy oils. In the early plant operated by Roelen, the 
ratio of normal to isopropionaldehyde was about 2:1. 
 
7.4.1. Cobalt Carbonyl Catalysts 
 
During early experiments, Roelen used the standard Fischer–Tropsch catalyst 
(30CoO/66SiO2/2ThO2/2MgO) in both stages of alcohol production. He soon 
realized, however, that in the presence of carbon monoxide, cobalt octacarbonyl 
was formed and reacted reversibly with hydrogen to give a homogeneous cata-
lyst. The reaction then proceeded in solution. For this reason, all further devel-
opments used a convenient and cheap soluble cobalt salt, such as cobalt naph-
thenate. Cobalt naphthenate was soluble in the organic reaction medium and was 
available commercially. 
 
The partial pressures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are critical in main-
taining the concentration of the active species, cobalt hydridotetracarbonyl and 
RCH=CH2  +  H2 + CO           RCH2(CH2)2CHO                       (7.44)

cobalt hydridotricarbonyl, in the equilibrium reaction mixture with dicobalt oc-
tacarbonyl. 
 
The usually accepted reaction mechanism with cobalt octacarbonyl can be 
simplified as follows:82 
• An activation step gives an equilibrium mixture containing the catalyst, 
which coordinates with the olefin forming a π-complex: 
 
 
  Co2(CO)8 + H2 ↔ 2 HCo(CO)4 ↔ 2 HCo(CO)3 + 2 CO 
(7.45) 
 
• The olefin is then inserted into the Co–H bond to form an alkyl species: 
 
 
  
RCH=CH2 + HCo(CO)3 ↔ H(RCH=CH2)Co(CO)3 
(7.46) 
 
 
  
H(RH=CH2)Co(CO)3 ↔ RCH2CH2Co(CO)3 
(7.47) 
 
• Molecular carbon monoxide is inserted into Co–C bond to form an acyl 
species: 
 
 
  
RCH2CH2Co(CO)3 + CO ↔ RCH2CH2COCo(CO)3 
(7.48) 
 
• The final, irreversible step is hydrogenolysis of the acyl species to the al-
dehyde and catalyst regeneration: 
 
 
  RCH2CH2COCo(CO)3 + H2 → RCH2CHO + HCo(CO)3 
(7.49) 
 
 
The reaction steps are reversible and isomerization of the olefin, alkyl, or 
acyl species can take place to allow the formation of isoaldehydes. The typical 
4:1 product distribution of normal and isoaldehydes must be separated if the 
mixture cannot be used commercially. Efforts were therefore made to increase 
the proportion of useful normal aldehydes during operation. Partial success was 
achieved by operating at lower temperatures with higher carbon monoxide par-
tial pressures, although this decreased conversion to aldehydes. A major prob-
lem with the cobalt catalyst was the tendency to decompose at high temperature 
and to deposit metal onto the reactor walls. This led to loss of activity and low 
catalyst recovery. 
 
7.4.2. Phosphine Modified Catalysts 
 
By the 1970s, the chemistry of the process was being investigated in an effort to 
improve performance. The main objectives were as follows:

• Reduce by-product formation. 
Catalysts derived from rhodium were found to be much more active than those 
from cobalt, but rhodium was vastly more expensive than cobalt and gave a 
lower yield of the normal aldehyde. Around the same time, it was shown in 
work by Shell that thermally-stable complexes could be formed83 by partial re-
placement of the carbonyl groups in the cobalt carbonyl catalyst by ligands such 
as organophosphines. This increase in stability allowed the reaction temperature 
to be increased to such an extent that the reaction pressure could be reduced with 
no loss in the rate of reaction. This resulted in a lowering of both operating and 
capital costs. However, a big disadvantage of the new catalyst was that the rate 
of reaction decreased by about 80% and hydrogenation activity increased. This 
led to lower yields, higher paraffin production, and more alcohol formation. The 
process is still being used to produce 2-ethyl hexanol directly from propylene 
and a range of higher-molecular weight detergent alcohols. Operating conditions 
for unmodified and modified cobalt catalysts are shown in Table 7.9.

7.4.3. Low-Pressure Hydroformylation 
 
Union Carbide Corporation was working on a low-pressure hydroformylation 
process as early as 1967, and used a rhodium carbonyl catalyst modified with a 
triphenyl phosphine ligand.84 The ligand dramatically improved the normal/iso- 
aldehyde ratio of the product when compared to the free metal carbonyl. Re-
duced operating temperatures and pressures, low by-product formation, and the 
elimination of metallic rhodium deposition were also achieved. By 1975, a plant 
was operating using this catalyst, and the process was being licensed for the 
hydroformylation of propylene.  
 
In the early version of the process, propylene and synthesis gas were circu-
lated through the catalyst solution to minimize handling of the catalyst and thus 
to reduce catalyst losses. The product was recovered by using the reaction ex-
otherm to vaporize the product, which was then removed from the reactor by the 
flow of the process gases. The life of the catalyst was relatively short in these 
early plants, despite careful purification of the propylene and the synthesis gas. 
The operating conditions are shown in Table 7.9. 
 
The operating procedure was subsequently modified.85 A single liquid phase 
containing a solution of the catalyst in the form of rhodium carbonyl with a 
modified ligand, together with excess ligand circulated through the reactor with 
the propylene and synthesis gas. Solubilizing agents such as N-methyl pyrroli-
done or a polyalkylene glycol were added to ensure that both the catalyst and 
products were completely miscible. This gave better mixing of the catalyst with 
the propylene and synthesis gas thus promoting formation of a single liquid 
phase. Other ligands such as modified diorganophosphates could also be used.86 
 
On leaving the reactor, the nonpolar products were separated from the cata-
lyst by adding water or methanol to split the reaction mixture into two liquid 
phases. The two phases were separated by decantation, and the products thus 
recovered. The catalyst was dried and purified before being returned to the reac-
tor. The lifetime of the catalyst was extended to several years, though make-up 
quantities had to be added to replenish any small losses. Increasing the solubility 
of the catalyst by use of more effective ligands was claimed to produce a cata-
lyst that was active for the hydroformylation of octane, dodecene and even sty-
rene, in addition to propylene and butene. 
 
Ruhrchemie and Rhone Poulenc introduced a two-phase modification to the 
basic propylene hydroformylation process in 1984.87 The aqueous phase con-
tained the rhodium catalyst, and a phosphine derivative was circulated through 
the reactor with the propylene and synthesis gas. The specific phosphine used 
was triphenylphosphine in which the meta-position of the phenyl group had 
been substituted by the sodium salt of the sulphonic acid. The products formed 
an organic layer that was separated by decantation when the two immiscible 
liquid phases were removed from the reactor. The aqueous layer was returned to 
the reactor for further use. The catalyst is not affected by sulfur poisons, and can

operate for as long as 12 years provided that additional ligand is regularly sup-
plied to replace losses owing to degradation. The solubility of the propylene in 
the reaction medium can become a limitation in the process. 
 
7.4.4. Commercial Operation 
 
Hydroformylation processes are used extensively throughout the world and the 
single largest product is 2-ethyl hexanol, which is converted to dioctylphthalate, 
which is used mainly as a plasticizer for polyvinylchloride. Cobalt carbonyl cat-
alysts are still important and produce large volumes of the higher-molecular-
weight aldehydes, most of which are converted to detergent alcohols. When al-
cohols are required, cobalt carbonyl catalysts, modified with phosphine ligands 
are useful in that they provide a high proportion of the normal alcohol relative to 
the iso-alcohol. 
 
Rhodium catalysts with phosphine ligands are used only for propylene hy-
droformylation, to produce butyraldehyde and then 2-ethyl hexanal, but are not 
used for the production of higher aldehydes. The available processes are com-
plementary and do not compete. The main factor in choosing a process is the 
product required. 
 
7.4.5. Acetic Acid 
 
Acetic acid was originally produced by bacterial oxidation of ethanol, but from 
around 1914, synthetic acetic acid was produced by the oxidation of acetalde-
hyde. Hydrocarbon oxidation processes using butane or naphtha as feedstock 
were introduced in the 1950s. In a typical liquid phase oxidation process, a co-
balt acetate catalyst operating at a temperature of 175°C, and a pressure of 54 
bar was used, and by-products could be recycled. Conditions could be modified 
to produce methyl ethyl ketone. 
 
The carbonylation of methanol based on Reppe chemistry was a major ad-
vance in acetic acid technology. BASF introduced this process in 1966, and used 
an iodide-promoted cobalt catalyst at high pressures in the range 500–700 bar.88 
The reaction was thought to proceed via cobalt hydridotetracarbonyl and hydro-
gen iodide as intermediates. The hydrogen iodide was believed to react with 
methanol to give methyl iodide, which underwent oxidative addition to the co-
balt carbonyl intermediate, thus forming a methyl cobalt derivative. Carbon 
monoxide was inserted into the methyl cobalt bond to give an acyl cobalt spe-
cies which on hydrolysis formed acetic acid and more hydrogen iodide, thus 
completing the catalytic cycle. 
 
This process was rapidly rendered obsolete by the introduction of the low 
pressure process by Monsanto89 in 1971. The catalyst was similar to the Union 
Carbide hydroformylation catalyst, and was based on rhodium carbonyl, pro-
moted with iodine. The operating pressure was only around 30–40 bar, with a 
302 
Chapter 7 
 
lower reaction temperature of about 180°C. These mild reaction conditions led 
to the formation of acetic acid at a selectivity of >99%, whereas the selectivity 
of the cobalt route was only 90%, and of course a major reduction in both capital 
and operating costs. Furthermore, the cobalt catalyst unlike the rhodium cata-
lysts was very sensitive to traces of hydrogen in the feed gases. 
 
While reaction rates for cobalt catalysts depend on the methanol concentra-
tion and partial pressure of carbon monoxide, the rates with rhodium catalysts 
are independent of both reactant and product concentrations. The reaction mech-
anism for cobalt catalyst in methanol carbonylation is similar to hydroformyla-
tion but is different for rhodium catalysts. The catalyst intermediate in the rho-
dium process is Rh(CO)2I2 and has been identified at 100°C and 6 atm by infra-
red spectroscopy.90 Reaction with methyl iodide in the rate-determining step 
then forms a methyl rhodium complex that rapidly gives an acyl complex 
(CH3CORh(CO)I3)2
2− from reaction with the high carbon monoxide content in 
the reactor. The complex decomposes after reaction with water to produce acetic 
acid, and with simultaneous regeneration of the catalyst: 
 
 
  
CH3OH + HI ↔ CH3I + H2O 
(7.50) 
 
 
  
CH3I + CO → CH3COI + H2O → CH3COOH + HI 
(7.51) 
 
 
By 1999 more than two-thirds of worldwide acetic acid was made by the 
Monsanto process using the rhodium catalyst. BP Chemicals purchased the 
rights to the process in 1986 and in 1996 introduced a promoted iridium acetate 
catalyst that was claimed to be more efficient with easier purification.91 A com-
parison of the BASF and Monsanto processes is shown in Table 7.10.

7.4.6. Acetaldehyde 
 
An interesting process for the production of acetaldehyde was based on the work 
of F. C. Phillips, who showed that ethylene could be oxidized to acetaldehyde by 
an aqueous palladium chloride solution.92 The palladium chloride was reduced 
to metallic palladium. During the late 1950’s, Wacker Chemie introduced a new 
process for the manufacture of acetaldehyde by direct oxidation of ethylene with 
air. The palladium metal was converted back to (PdCl4)2− by an acidic solution 
of cupric chloride, which was, itself, reduced to cuprous chloride. The cupric 
chloride was regenerated by reaction with air in hydrochloric acid solution. The 
reaction sequence is shown in the following equations: 
 
 
 C2H4 + Pd(Cl4)2− + H2O → CH3CHO + Pdo + 2 HCl + 2 Cl− 
(7.52) 
 
 
  
2 Cl− + Pdo + 2 CuCl2  →  Pd(Cl4)2− + 2 CuCl 
(7.53) 
 
 
  
2 CuCl + ½ O2 + 2 HCl  →  2 CuCl2 + H2O 
(7.54) 
 
Overall: 
C2H4 + ½ O2  →  CH3CHO 
(7.55) 
 
 
In the Wacker two-stage process, the ethylene was completely oxidized 
with palladium chloride/cupric chloride solution at 110°C and 10 bar, with the 
stoichiometric volume of air in the reaction vessel. Acetaldehyde was recovered 
from the circulating solution and the palladium oxidized with air at 100°C and 
100 bar pressure in a second vessel before the catalyst solution was returned to 
the reactor.  
 
A one-stage process was then introduced by Hoechst. A mixture of almost 
completely pure ethylene and oxygen (above the upper flammability limit) was 
passed through the catalyst solution which contained about 200 g/liter cupric 
chloride and 4 g/liter palladium chloride. At a temperature of about 120°–130°C 
and a pressure of 3 bar, 35–45% of the ethylene was converted consuming all of 
the oxygen. The acetaldehyde product distilled out of the reaction mixture using 
the exotherm from the reaction, and the remaining ethylene was recycled. Selec-
tivity in both processes is about 95%, and the by-products are acetic acid, cro-
tonaldehyde, and methyl/ethyl chlorides, which must be removed periodically. 
The process was still used to make most of the acetaldehyde required in the ear-
ly 1990s. In 1992, Catalytica suggested a possible replacement—phosphor-
molybdovanadate/polyoxoanions—for the cupric chloride used with palladium 
chloride in the two-stage process, to avoid corrosion problems from hydrochlo-
ric acid.

7.5. METATHESIS OF OLEFINS 
Olefin metathesis is the disproportionation of two olefin molecules, via cleavage 
of the double bonds as shown in the equation: 
 
 
  
2 RCH=CH2  →  RCH=CHR + CH2=CH2 
(7.56) 
 
and 
 
 
  RCH=CH2 + R'CH=CH2  →  RCH=CHR' + CH2=CH2 
(7.57) 
 
The reaction was announced by Phillips Petroleum in 1964 and became known 
as the Triolefin process because it was first used to balance the production of 
olefins from naphtha steam crackers by converting propylene into ethylene and 
butene-2.94 
 
As the scope of the reaction increased, the name Olefin Metathesis was in-
troduced by Goodyear, who also pioneered the use of homogeneous catalysts. 
The reaction had first been recognized during experiments on the development 
of a heterogeneous catalyst to replace mineral acids in alkylation reactions. Mo-
lybdenum hexacarbonyl catalyst supported on alumina produced 2-pentene 
(40%) from mixed n-butenes together with propylene (51%) and hexene (9%). 
Tungsten hexacarbonyl was less active than the molybdenum catalyst, and in 
total contrast, it was found that chromium hexacarbonyl acted as a polymeriza-
tion catalyst. 
 
Later experiments showed that metal oxides were more active than carbon-
yls and that the most active catalyst was actually a commercial cobalt/molybdate 
hydrodesulfurization catalyst containing 3% cobalt oxide and 8% molybdenum 
oxide supported on γ-alumina. Molybdenum and tungsten oxides supported on 
high-surface-area silica, similar to the familiar Phillips chromium/silica polyeth-
ylene catalyst, were also active in metathesis reactions and more resistant to 
poisons. The operating temperature range for a tungsten oxide/silica catalyst 
was, however, significantly higher at 300°–400°C than for the cobalt/molybdate 
catalyst which operated at 120°–210°C, although the catalyst volume required 
was reduced by a factor of ten. Operating pressure was in the range 25–30 bar. 
 
BP has developed an even more active rhenium oxide catalyst supported on 
alumina that operates at 20°–50°C, with an equilibrium conversion higher than 
60%. This follows from an observation by Phillips that alumina is a more suita-
ble support than silica. 
 
7.5.1. Process Development 
 
The first commercial use of the process was in Canada in 1966, to convert a 
surplus of propylene into polymer-grade ethylene and 30,000 tonnes/year of 
 
Petrochemical Catalysts 
305 
 
butene-2, at about 40% propylene conversion. The Phillips neohexene process is 
used to convert di-isobutylene and ethylene to the product by a double-bond 
isomerization/metathesis mechanism. All metathesis catalysts are gradually de-
activated by the formation of high-molecular-weight compounds and must be 
regenerated by heating with air to 500°–600°C. The cycle time before regenera-
tion depends on the feed purity and the operating temperature. 
 
The catalyst is installed in three reactors, two of which are on line at any 
given time, while the third is being regenerated ready for use. Continuous cata-
lyst regeneration, similar to the method used in the platinum-catalyzed reform-
ing of naphtha, could be used providing that the plant size is large enough to 
make the additional capital cost economic.96 Metathesis is, of course, an equilib-
rium process, so that depending on the ratio of the reacting molecules and the 
temperature, the nature of the products can be selected. 
 
Following experience at an Arco plant in the United States, it was shown 
that propylene production from a naphtha steam cracker can be increased by 
using a metathesis unit. This has the advantage of maintaining maximum eth-
ylene production at high cracking severity. The largest naphtha steam cracker 
built by the year 2000 was designed to incorporate an isomerization unit to pro-
vide butene-2 from the mixed C4 stream that could produce propylene when 
reacted with an equivalent proportion of ethylene. While the steam cracker on its 
own was designed to produce 950,000 tonnes.year−1 of ethylene and 540,000 
metric tons/year of propylene, the use of the metathesis unit increased the level 
of production to 860,000 tonnes/year of both propylene and ethylene.96 
 
The rhenium/alumina catalyst operating at 20°–50°C can produce 63% con-
version at 35°C, whereas a tungsten oxide/silica catalyst operating at 300°–
400°C gave 55% conversion at 330°C.97 
 
It is important to remove all oxygen, dienes and acetylenes from the feed to 
the metathesis reactor. Furthermore, the C4 stream needs to contain the mini-
mum practical level of butene-1 and isobutene to minimize the metathesis reac-
tion of the C4 hydrocarbons, which results in the formation of C5 and C6 olefins. 
The higher olefins lead to polymer formation and catalyst deactivation. An ex-
cess of ethylene normally suppresses the C4 reactions. A typical steam cracker 
C4 stream, which has been subjected to selective hydrogenation to remove impu-
rities and fractionation to provide a suitable butene-2 rich raffinate-2, or the bu-
tene-2 rich effluent from an MTBE unit, can provide a suitable feed for the me-
tathesis reactor. The catalyst operating cycle with a rhenium catalyst is usually 
fairly long. Regular catalyst regeneration may be necessary and the catalyst can 
last for several years. 
 
7.5.2. The Shell Higher-Olefins Process 
 
The Shell Higher-Olefins Process (SHOP), which includes a commercial appli-
cation of metathesis, was developed to convert ethylene into a range (C10–C18) 
306 
Chapter 7 
 
of straight-chain detergent alkenes containing an even number of carbon at-
oms.97 Three catalytic steps are involved. 
 
In the first stage, ethylene is oligomerized to give a Schultz-Flory distribu-
tion of linear olefins in the range C4 to C20. The catalyst is a soluble nickel com-
plex formed by the reaction of bis(cyclo-octadienyl) nickel with a phenyl or 
cyclohexyl-substituted phosphine derivative of the type R2PCH2COO−, in bu-
tanediol solution. When the ethylene is removed, the products separate as a hy-
drocarbon phase, and the catalyst solution can then be recycled. 
 
About 30% of the α-olefin products are in the C10–C18 range. These are 
separated by distillation and the residual C4–C8 and C20+ fractions pass into an 
isomerization reactor containing a suitable heterogeneous catalyst. An almost 
equilibrium distribution of straight-chain internal olefins forms at 80°–140°C 
and 3.5–17 bar. Hardly any α-olefins remain. The bottom C20 fraction from the 
distillation column can be changed to any boiling range depending on the prod-
ucts required. The final metathesis step uses a typical molybdena/alumina cata-
lyst to converted the isomerized internal olefins into a new range of mainly line-
ar internal olefins from which about 10–15% of C11–C14 olefins can be separated 
by distillation. The fraction of olefins with fewer than ten carbon atoms is recy-
cled to the metathesis reactor and the fraction with more than fifteen carbon at-
oms is recycled first to the isomerization reactor. It is also possible to add eth-
ylene to the internal olefin feed entering the metathesis reactor to increase the 
yield of α-olefins. The olefins produced are converted into detergent alcohols by 
hydroformylation to aldehydes, which are then hydrogenated to alcohols.

OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION 
CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
Catalytic polymerization processes have become increasingly important as the 
use of plastics has escalated throughout the world. Many common plastics were 
discovered in the 1930s, and after the 1939–1945 war this created a demand for 
petrochemical intermediates derived from the refining industry. Ethylene and 
propylene are now common building blocks for plastics and by the year 2000, 
polyethylene, polypropylene and their copolymers were the most widely used 
plastic materials. The gradual development of polyolefin production is shown in 
Table 8.1. 
 
Even before Ziegler discovered his catalysts for the polymerization of ole-
fins in 1953,1 it was well known that high-molecular-weight oils and insoluble 
waxes could be formed by the treatment of olefins and synthesis gas with metal 
alkyls and transition metal catalysts.2 However, the first polyethylene process 
was the result of research into high-pressure reactions such as those undertaken 
by ICI in the 1920s and 1930s.3 By March 1933, an experiment with high-purity 
ethylene and benzaldehyde at 1900 bar pressure and 170°C had produced a sub-
stance like paraffin wax when the pressure vessel had apparently developed a 
leak. After several more experiments, in which it was confirmed that polymer 
had formed, and that the reaction could be explosive, work stopped until 1935, 
at which time it appeared that there might be a commercial demand for the 
product. When relatively impure ethylene was heated at 170°C, the pressure 
could not be maintained at the target of 2000 bar and polyethylene, in the form 
of a white powder, was formed. It had been recognized, of course, that benzal-

dehyde played no part in the reaction. By 1936, it was found that traces of oxygen

Chapter 8 
of the oxygen is not to act as a catalyst in the normal sense of the word, but to 
act as a source of free radicals. The free radical reacts with a molecule of eth-
ylene, which then undergoes chain growth by a free radical mechanism. The 
oxygen is better referred to as an initiator. Details of both molecular weight and 
operating conditions had been accidentally disclosed at a conference held in 
1935, although experts, including Hermann Staudinger, refused to believe that 
the polymerization of ethylene was possible. Fortunately, the minutes of the 
meeting did not include details of the disclosure and the ICI patent application 
was subsequently granted.3 A full-scale plant with a capacity of about 100 tons 
of polyethylene per year started operation in September 1939. 
 
The ICI patent took precedence over work by Union Carbide in the United 
States and by I. G. Farben in Germany. Experts from Germany had visited the 
ICI polyethylene plant in 1937, and according to an official from BASF, then 
began the work that led to the development of the Lupolen Process during the 
war.5 
8.1. LOW-PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE 
In 1953 a further step in the development of polyethylene was announced by 
Karl Ziegler at the Max Plank Institute in Mulheim.6 Ziegler began by studying 
the reaction of lithium hydride and ethylene. This was not very promising, and 
he turned to the reaction of aluminium hydride and ethylene, which gave trieth-
ylaluminium at temperatures in the range 60–80°C. Triethylaluminium is, of 
course, spontaneously inflammable in air and reacts explosively with water. The 
handling of these dangerous reactive compounds needed the development of a 
whole range of new experimental and production techniques. Polymers were 
formed by addition of further molecules of ethylene at temperatures around 
100–120°C and these were eventually developed as low molecular weight α-

olefins. The reaction then continued. The reaction became known as the Aufbau 
reaction and produced a linear polymer, in marked contrast to the highly 
branched product from the high pressure processes. 
 
The subsequent development of the process for high-density polyethylene 
was the result of careful systematic observation by the experimental team. Fur-
ther work on the oligomerization of ethylene to the commercially-valuable C6 
and C8 α-olefins led to the discovery that the displacement reaction was cata-
lyzed by traces of nickel in the reactor. The displacement reaction became faster 
than the growth reaction as the concentration of nickel was increased, and at 
120°C, only the dimer was produced. In subsequent investigations of other met-
als as co-catalysts in conjunction with triethylaluminium, it was shown that zir-
conium acetylacetonate inhibited the displacement reaction completely, and that 
polyethylene was the only product. Further work led to the development of the 
well-known titanium chloride/triethyl aluminum catalyst, which operated at low 
temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The reaction became known as the Mul-
heim Atmospheric Polyethylene Process.6 
 
At about the same time that news of the Ziegler discovery was released, the 
Phillips Petroleum Company in the United States announced that it had devel-
oped a medium-pressure, catalytic process (500 psig) to produce a high-density, 
crystalline polyethylene.7 The process was discovered when traces of ethylene in 
a flue gas had polymerized over conventional cracking catalysts. The Phillips 
catalyst contained chromic oxide supported on silica. The Standard Oil Compa-
ny of Indiana (later Amoco) also introduced a medium pressure process using a 
catalyst comprising molybdenum oxide supported on carbon or alumina, but it 
did not enjoy the success of the Ziegler or Phillips processes and was only oper-
ated in three full-scale plants.8 
 
8.1.1. Polyethylene Process Development 
 
The Phillips process, used a different type of catalyst from Ziegler, was availa-
ble for license almost immediately and became a commercial success by produc-
ing a linear, highly crystalline product with higher density than the high-pressure 
polymer discovered by ICI. The new polymer became known as high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE), whereas the original ICI polyethylene was thereafter 
known as low density polyethylene (LDPE). Phillips did not develop a catalyst 
for the production of polypropylene. 
 
Ziegler, working in the academic environment of the Max Planck Institut, 
did not develop his own process for the polymerization of olefins, but did offer 
the rights to his catalysts for license. Licensees were required to develop their 
own versions of a polymerization process that was based on Ziegler’s discovery. 
It is not surprising that several different versions of the Ziegler processes 
evolved to produce HDPE, each based on somewhat different catalyst formula-
tions and operating procedures.

8.1.2. The Development of Polypropylene Catalysts 
 
Ziegler restricted his studies to the polyethylene catalyst, and the next major 
discovery was made by one of his licensees. Professor Guilio Natta, who worked 
with Montedison in Italy, investigated the polymerization of propylene and other 
α-olefins to produce solid crystalline polymers. He found that polymerization 
did not proceed when using the brown titanium trichloride used by Ziegler. He 
showed that crystalline stereoregular polypropylene9 could be produced when 
using violet titanium trichloride. 
8.2. ZIEGLER–NATTA CATALYSTS 
The versatile range of low-pressure catalysts, discovered by Ziegler and modi-
fied by Natta in 1953 and 1954 was a tremendous advance in catalysis. It led to 
the introduction of a wide range of commercially useful polyolefins, including 
polypropylene and many copolymers as well as polyethylene. Since the initial 
discoveries, there have been many developments in both the catalysts and the 
commercial polymerization processes that have led to increased activity and 
productivity. 
 
8.2.1. Early Polyolefin Catalysts 
 
The original Ziegler catalyst comprised a metal alkyl and a transition metal 
compound that could be reduced and alkylated in the presence of the metal alkyl 
co-catalyst to give active initiating and propagating centers. Since 1954, the 
original catalyst has been developed continuously and the active centers modi-
fied with coordinating ligands. Most of the commercial catalysts are heteroge-
neous and the active component is supported on an inert material. 
 
The most widely used transition metal salts have been the relatively cheap 
titanium or vanadium halides, reduced with aluminum alkyls. In Ziegler’s work, 
titanium tetrachloride was reduced to brown ß-titanium trichloride, which was 
able to polymerize ethylene. However, when ß-titanium trichloride catalyst was 
used in the polymerization of propylene, the product contained a high proportion 
of the gum like atactic polymer, which was not viable for commercial use. In 
contrast, Natta, in his work on the polymerization of propylene and other α-
olefins, showed that violet α-titanium trichloride could polymerize propylene to 
the useful, crystalline, isotactic polymer. Nevertheless, a relatively large quanti-
ty of atactic polypropylene still had to be separated from the commercial isotac-
tic product. 
 
Most of the early catalyst development was related to the need for a more 
active catalyst to improve productivity. With low-activity catalysts, the polymer 
must be de-ashed to remove solid catalyst residues so as to meet product speci-

fications. To achieve a high productivity, the catalyst particles should fragment 
during the process and be diluted with high-molecular-weight polymers. The 
most significant difference between olefin polymerization and other catalytic 
processes is that the catalyst remains in the product. 
 
In crystalline Ziegler–Natta catalysts, the properties of the active transition 
metal centers with their vacant coordination sites are different, depending on 
their position on the fractured crystal surface. This leads to variations in both 
activity and reducibility and consequently to the wide variations in polymer mo-
lecular weight observed in commercial products. The continuing development of 
catalysts has therefore been related to the need for the formation of active more 
regular sites, which can then produce polymer chains with a more uniform mo-
lecular weight and, in the case of polypropylene, higher stereospecificity. This 
subsequently led to the use of a range of supported titanium catalysts for both 
polyethylene and polypropylene production and, more recently, to the use of 
single-site metallocene catalysts. These improvements have led to increases in 
the range of possible products even further. 
 
8.2.2. Ziegler’s Brown Titanium Trichloride 
 
The early heterogeneous Ziegler catalysts were prepared in the reactor by the 
reaction in solution from a mixture with a molar ratio of titanium tetrachloride to 
triethyl aluminium of less than 2.5:1 to prevent excessive reduction of the titani-
um species. The organotitanium complexes that formed decomposed spontane-
ously at ambient temperature to a precipitate of the brown metastable ß-titanium 
trichloride.10 This is a very superficial description because the nature of the tita-
nium product depends on many factors, such as the relative concentration of the 
components, the solvent used, the order of addition, and the temperature of the 
reaction. The aluminum alkyl acts as an alkylating agent and the resulting alkyl 
titanium species decomposes to a lower valence state. Triethyl aluminum is a 
stronger alkylating agent than diethyl aluminum chloride and was preferred for 
polyethylene catalyst production. 
 
A controlled molar excess of the aluminum alkyl cocatalyst was added to 
the reduced titanium (~2:1) before the catalyst entered the reaction zone. All the 
components were carefully purified and handled in a dry, inert atmosphere. De-
spite these precautions, the catalyst had a low surface area and was not very ac-
tive. Most of the titanium was inaccessible due to the formation of relatively 
large crystals and relatively few active sites were formed at the crystal edges. 
Furthermore, ß-titanium trichloride was not stereospecific for the polymerization 
of higher olefins.  
 
Activity and stereospecificity depended, therefore, not only on the catalyst 
preparation but also on the size and crystallinity of the particles. The careful 
control of conditions and the optimum concentration of reactants were necessary 
to form particles that fragmented during use to expose fresh active sites and to 
316 
Chapter 8 
increase productivity. Higher productivity, that would allow the use of the pol-
ymer without de-ashing to remove catalyst particles, remained an objective. 
 
8.2.3. Natta’s Violet Titanium Trichloride 
 
The important contribution made by Natta was the modification of the Ziegler 
catalyst for the polymerization of propylene. Pasquon, one of Natta’s colleagues, 
reported that,  
“he assumed stereospecificity to be associated with the regularity of the cat-
alyst surface and used the crystalline violet ß-titanium trichloride instead of 
liquid titanium tetrachloride to prepare his catalysts.”11  
In this way, Natta was able to develop a stereospecific catalyst based on α-
titanium trichloride, produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride in hydrogen at 
500°–800°C, before combining it with the triethyl aluminum co-catalyst. 
 
The catalyst was further improved by producing a stereospecific form of α-
titanium trichloride. The metastable ß-titanium trichloride which also contained 
co-crystallized aluminum trichloride was heated to temperatures of 300°–400°C. 
The transformation proceeded via intermediate γ-titanium trichloride, which 
could also produce stereoregular polymer at temperatures of 100°–200°C. The 
α- and γ-crystalline modifications of titanium trichloride have layered hexagonal 
and cubic crystal structures, respectively, and are both active catalysts. 
 
Stauffer produced titanium trichloride commercially by reducing titanium 
tetrachloride with aluminum metal in an aromatic solvent at about 250°C.12 The 
aluminum could be activated by ball milling, with the addition of a small 
amount of aluminum trichloride. This procedure formed high-activity γ-titanium 
trichloride containing co-crystallized aluminum trichloride. It was soon realized, 
from experience during commercial production of polypropylene catalysts, that 
both the α and γ forms of titanium trichloride were more than ten times as active 
after the crystals had been ground or milled to produce smaller particles.13 Mill-
ing converts α- and γ-titanium trichloride to the more active δ-titanium trichlo-
ride and increases the surface area from about 5 m2 g−1 to 20 m2 g−1. The crystal 
structure of a range of titanium trichloride catalysts is described in Table 8.2. 
 
Early commercial catalysts were supplied to a strict specification. The aver-
age particle size was usually in the range 10–100 μm with an activity exceeding 
1000 g polypropylene per gram of catalyst and an isotactic index exceeding 
88%. Continuous, rather than batch, operation was possible with the new,  ex-
ternally  formed  catalyst but the efficiency was still  low  and the  polypropyl-
ene still contained unacceptably high levels of both catalyst residues and atactic 
polymer.

Although polypropylene was only produced on a small scale from 1957, 
and despite the relatively greater importance of high-density polyethylene, work 
on improving polypropylene catalysts led to a better overall understanding of 
both catalysts and process operation. 
 
8.2.4. Second-Generation Propylene Polymerization Catalysts 
 
By 1960, the original preparation of brown ß-titanium trichloride in situ was no 
longer used by most producers. It was replaced by commercial γ-titanium tri-
chloride, which contained an isomorphous form of aluminum chloride in the 
molar ratio (3TiCl3.AlCl3). This was ball milled to form δ-titanium trichloride, 
which increased activity and led to the formation of a higher proportion of iso-
tactic polymer. However, even after these improvements in catalyst perfor-
mance, there was still a limitation to the catalyst activity because the aluminum 
trichloride in the catalyst reacted with the triethyl aluminum co-catalyst to form 
quantities of ethyl aluminum dichloride, which is detrimental to the polymeriza-
tion reactions. Titanium trichloride crystals were also relatively large despite the 
milling treatment to reduce particle size. 
 
A further improvement in performance was achieved by the addition of 
electron donors (Lewis bases), such as esters, ethers, or amines, to the catalyst, 
which can form complexes with aluminum alkyls. Electron donors could be 
added either with the co-catalyst, or during the γ-titanium trichloride milling 
stage, depending on the compound used or the result required. In addition to 
318 
Chapter 8 
modifying the effects of poisons, electron donors also deactivated nonstereospe-
cific sites and improved the stereochemical and kinetic behavior of the active 
centers by acting as a template to control insertion of the monomer into the 
growing chain. In many cases, electron donors had a somewhat adverse effect on 
productivity, due to the deactivation above. They were, however, still useful. By 
increasing the isotactic index, more efficient use of propylene was obtained, 
because a smaller proportion of the worthless atactic polymer was formed. De-
tails are given in Table 8.3. 
 
Refinements to the Ziegler–Natta catalysts continued, with several attempts 
to convert brown ß-titanium trichloride to the active purple γ-titanium trichloride 
at a lower temperature. The objective of this work was an increase in the activity 
of the catalyst by avoiding the formation of the aluminium trichloride that was 
isomorphous with the γ-titanium trichloride. High temperatures were normally 
required to reduce the aluminium chloride content, and this led to a reduction in 
the surface area, and hence, activity. In a development by Solvay, titanium tetra-
chloride was reduced with aluminum alkyl at about 1°C, before extraction of the 
co-crystallized aluminum chloride with either dibutyl- or di-isoamyl ether. The 
porous ß-titanium trichloride was then heated with excess titanium tetrachloride 
at 65–100°C to remove excess ether and to produce high-surface-area (<75 
m2g−1) purple α-titanium trichloride under controlled conditions.14 
 
A feature of these catalysts, which were more active and stereospecific in 
polypropylene production, was that they formed uniform 25 to 35 μm diameter 
spherical particles and the shape of the polymer replicated the catalyst morphol-
ogy. Unfortunately, despite the favorable effect of these catalysts on the shape of 
the polymer particles produced, the particles were unstable during storage and 
de-ashing was still necessary. The multistage recipes were only used where on-
site production facilities were available. 
 
Worldwide demand for polypropylene was still only about 1–6 million 
tones year−1 during the period from 1970 to 1980. As demand began to increase, 
more efficient catalysts, based largely on a successful range of supported poly-
ethylene catalysts, were developed.

8.2.5. Supported Polyethylene Catalysts 
 
The demand for HDPE was always greater than that for polypropylene (PP) and 
more efficient polyethylene catalysts were needed from about the mid-1960s. 
The brown ß-titanium trichloride catalyst introduced by Ziegler had very low 
productivity because less than 1% of the total titanium content actually took part 
in the polymerization reaction.15 De-ashing the polymers to remove the titanium 
and halogen residues represented a significant production cost. Moreover, as 
soon as the potential of the polymerization products was realized, the scope for 
new and improved polymers with specific molecular weight and molecular 
weight distribution became commercially attractive. 
 
A catalyst with a higher proportion of uniformly active centers was there-
fore required, not only to achieve better control of polymer chain length but to 
allow the introduction of α-olefins into the polymer chain. Regular branching in 
the polymer chain could give a range of lower density products and could im-
prove on the variable branching in LDPE produced at high pressure. Such poly-
mers became known as linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). 
 
The use of commercial 3TiCl3.AlCl3 catalysts for HDPE production had 
already avoided the need for ‘in situ’ catalyst preparation and more active sup-
ported catalysts became available in about 1970. These had almost replaced the 
first- and second generation Ziegler catalysts by 1980. A wide variety of typical 
supports had been investigated, including silica and alumina, although despite 
the success of Phillips catalyst, these had low activity.16 The first useful supports 
to be commercialized were based on a range of crystalline magnesium com-
pounds with surface hydroxyl groups.17 For example, high yields were obtained 
when using a support based on magnesium hydroxide, combined with titanium 
tetrachloride and a triethyl aluminum co-catalyst. 
 
Magnesium supports continued to show the most promise and were studied 
intensively during the 1970s. Magnesium alkyls and Grignard reagents also re-
act with titanium tetrachloride to produce species that, in conjunction with tri-
ethyl aluminum co-catalysts, are also very productive and provide a high propor-
tion of active centers. The solid magnesium-based catalysts were found to be 
nodular and to contain magnesium chloride.18 Other very active high-surface-
area porous catalysts were produced from magnesium ethoxide and titanium 
tetrachloride using a triethyl aluminum cocatalyst.19 The high pore volume of 
the nodules led to catalyst disintegration during operation as polymer chains 
were formed. Productivity was related to the ratio of co-catalyst and titanium 
used, while the molecular weight distribution could be controlled by the addition 
of relatively low hydrogen levels to the olefin feed. 
 
Highly active catalysts containing 3–4% titanium were prepared by co-
milling titanium tetrachloride with magnesium chloride and then using a triethyl 
aluminum co-catalyst. The crystal structure of magnesium chloride is similar to 
both α- and γ-titanium trichloride; during milling, a disordered structure, similar 
320 
Chapter 8 
to δ- titanium trichloride, develops and the extremely small particles have a high 
surface area of up to 200 m2 g−1.20,21 The magnesium ions at the edges of crystal-
lites react with the titanium tetrachloride and provide active sites. 
 
Catalytic activity can be considerably increased if the magnesium chloride 
is first combined with a suitable Lewis base, such as an ester, acid, alcohol, or 
amine, before reaction with an excess of titanium tetrachloride and subsequent 
activation with triethyl aluminum. Polyethylene produced with these catalysts 
has a lower molecular weight than that from the titanium trichloride catalysts 
mentioned earlier and less hydrogen is needed for molecular weight control. 
 
8.2.6. Supported Polypropylene Catalysts 
 
More efficient use of titanium was also possible when using the same catalysts 
to produce polypropylene. The supported catalysts were more active and there 
was no need to remove catalyst residues from the polymer. The preparation of 
both nodular polyethylene catalysts, containing magnesium chloride from mag-
nesium alkyls or Grignard reagents, and fragmenting catalysts made from mag-
nesium ethoxide led to the production of polypropylene with controlled physical 
shape and better processing characteristics. 
 
8.2.6.1.   Third-Generation Catalysts 
 
The magnesium supports used for polyethylene catalysts could be modified for 
use in polypropylene production, and magnesium chloride proved to be the most 
suitable when used with a Lewis base electron donor. Milled magnesium chlo-
ride was known to have the same layer structure as α- and γ-titanium trichloride 
with the quadrivalent titanium ion (0.068 nm diameter), being about the same 
size as the divalent magnesium ion (0.066 nm diameter). In 1968, Montedison 
and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries both disclosed the production of a highly 
active, very stereospecific catalyst that contained about 3% titanium on a mag-
nesium chloride support,22 promoted with a Lewis base, such as ethyl benzo-
ate.23 The polymer produced contained less than 1 ppm titanium with an isotac-
tic index of more than 90%, which was improvement on the product made with 
previous catalysts. 
 
During catalyst preparation, the magnesium chloride was milled with ethyl 
benzoate (mole ratio 5:1) before the small particles were digested with titanium 
tetrachloride at 80–130°C. The solid was washed with a hydrocarbon and dried. 
The electron donor formed complexes with surface sites on the magnesium chlo-
ride particles and also prevented particles from sticking together during subse-
quent handling. Titanium tetrachloride replaced some of the attached ethyl ben-
zoate and entered the support lattice, particularly at edge and corner sites. The 
catalyst contained between 1–4% titanium and 5–20% ethyl benzoate, depend-
ing on the titanium content. During use, the catalyst was activated by triethyl 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
321 
aluminum and a second electron donor, such as ethyl anisate or p-methyl toluate, 
was added to deactivate nonstereospecific sites. The high initial activity of the 
catalyst decayed fairly quickly during operation, but several modifications to the 
preparation procedure could be made to improve performance. 
 
8.2.6.2. Fourth-Generation Catalysts 
 
Important objectives of the later production methods were to control the size and 
shape of the catalyst particles during precipitation of the magnesium chloride 
and to improve stability. Catalysts with better-controlled size and shape were 
based on the reaction of a precipitated magnesium chloride with titanium tetra-
chloride in a high-boiling-point hydrocarbon diluent at 80°C, with di-isobutyl 
phthalate added as an internal electron donor.24 After separation, the solid 
formed was reacted with more titanium tetrachloride at 120°C, before being 
washed and dried. The catalyst contained between 2–3% titanium and the 
phthalates used were limited to C4–C8 esters to avoid potential problems with 
colloid formation. The catalysts produced with phthalates as the internal donor 
had much higher surface area and pore volume than when ethyl benzoate was 
used. This method provided more active and stereospecific catalysts when used 
with the same triethyl aluminum co-catalyst and an external electron donor such 
as phenyl triethoxy silane. 
 
Very high isotactic index polymer, up to about 99%, could be produced 
with the early magnesium ethoxide–based catalysts using dibutyl phthalate as an 
internal donor and an organosilane external donor.25 Size and shape of the cata-
lyst particles produced from magnesium alkyls or ethoxides could be controlled 
by using polar organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, as in the preparation of 
the hydrocarbyl carbonate catalysts described by Amoco.26 
 
It was pointed out by Tait that the rapid initial increase in the rate of 
polymerization, with both the spherical magnesium chloride and magnesium 
ethoxide catalyst, decayed rapidly in the same way as ball-milled magnesium 
chloride catalysts.26 The loss of activity was presumably due to the small parti-
cles or fragments becoming blocked with polymer. 
 
The phenomenon of catalyst fragmentation was first recognized by Natta 
and Pasquon in 1959.27 The fragmentation continued until the co-catalyst could 
no longer reach any potential active centers and the polymer had replicated the 
shape of the catalyst fragments. The polymer-coated particles that formed were 
about seven times as big as the catalyst fragments. On the other hand, large, uni-
form, spherical catalyst particles prepared from magnesium alcoholates by care-
ful sieving have a higher activity that is very stable provided that care is taken to 
ensure that the particles do not fragment. 
 
Particles of catalysts for polypropylene, and the corresponding polypropyl-
ene particles can be examined using a scanning electron microscopy to show 
that the polymer particle is about 20 times as big as the original catalyst. Porous

catalysts, which do not fragment, allow the co-catalyst and monomer to continue 
reaction until all of the catalyst crystallites are covered in polymer. In practice, 
this means that the primary catalyst particles expand and are cemented with pol-
ymer as it forms. The reaction stops when the pore structure is saturated. The 
productivity of these catalysts can be related to the relative ability of particles to 
expand to expose more of the crystallites, and each catalyst particle may be re-
garded as a separate micro-reactor. The catalysts28 were produced by Montedi-
son for their Spheripol polypropylene process in 1981 and for the corresponding 
Spherilene polyethylene process in the early 1990s. Third- and fourth-generation 
Ziegler–Natta catalysts are summarized in Table 8.4. 
8.3. PHILLIPS POLYETHYLENE CATALYSTS 
In 1954, the Phillips Petroleum Company announced a polyethylene process that 
had been discovered by Hogan and Banks,29 in which a chromium catalyst was 
used. By 1956, nine companies had become process licensees and Phillips was 
producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in its plant at Pasadena, Texas.29 
A branched form of HDPE was made in 1958 by the introduction of a co-
monomer, 1-butene.29 This modified form of HDPE is now known as linear low-
density polyethylene (LLDPE). Since 1956 the Phillips process has been widely 
used throughout the world and various new forms of the chromium catalyst have 
continued the extremely successful development of the process. 
 
The catalyst preparation appeared to be a very simple procedure and con-
sisted of impregnation a silica support, made by precipitation of silica gel, with a 
soluble chromium salt. It was found that siloxyl chromium complexes were 
formed by the reaction of chromic oxide with the hydroxyl groups on the silica 
surface, as the catalyst was activated prior to operation.29 The structure of the 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
323 
silica gel support determined both the catalyst activity and the properties of the 
polymer formed. This contrasted strongly with Ziegler catalysts which needed 
the use of a co-catalyst and the polymer chains contained methyl and vinyl 
groups at either end with virtually no branching or internal double bonds. Since 
it was introduced, the productivity and applications of the support have been 
modified by control of the surface area, pore volume, and pore size, as well as 
by the addition of other oxides that influence both surface structure and the 
complexes formed with chromium compounds. 
 
Although it has not been easy to understand the mechanism of the polymer-
ization process with the chromium catalyst, many formulations have been intro-
duced that enable the catalyst to provide a wide range of polymers.30 These have 
provided increased catalyst activity and products with controlled molecular 
weight and chain length. For example, it is possible to modify the catalyst to 
form branched α-olefin co-polymers in situ and thus to prepared LLDPE direct-
ly. Moreover, by complexing two forms of chromium with the support, two dis-
tinct grades of polymer are formed that give a bimodal molecular weight distri-
bution to the HDPE produced. 
 
8.3.1. Catalyst Production 
 
Low-sodium silica gels, with high surface area and pore volume, are usually 
chosen as supports, as they can be synthesized to give a wide range of proper-
ties. Catalyst activity is proportional to surface area, while the pore size controls 
productivity and the molecular weight of the polymer. Small catalyst particles 
are used but the actual size depends on the polymerization process.31 Slurry re-
actors require particles in the size range 50–180 μm, whereas gas phase process-
es use smaller particles in the range 20–90 μm. 
 
Silica hydrosols are formed by mixing sodium silicate with sulfuric acid at 
pH < 7. The sol polymerizes spontaneously, is washed to remove sodium sul-
fate, and then aged before drying to form a xerogel. The concentration of the 
silica solution and the aging/drying conditions must be carefully chosen to pro-
duce a gel with the appropriate properties. Water is removed by heating in air or, 
if a very high porosity is required, with a suitable organic solvent. The surface 
area and pore volume of the gels produced are in the range 50–1000 m2 g−1 and 
0.4–3.0 cm3 g−1, respectively, depending on the aging and drying procedures, but 
a typical free-flowing product has a surface area of about 350 m2g−1 and a pore 
volume of 1.8 cm3 g−1. 
 
Silica gel is simply impregnated with an aqueous solution of chromium (III) 
acetate to give about 1% chromium on the catalyst.32 This low chromium con-
tent gives the maximum yield per unit weight of catalyst used during operation, 
and avoids the clumping of uncomplexed chromium oxide on the surface. It has 
been estimated that at this stage only about one-third of the total chromium 
324 
Chapter 8 
forms active centers. Some of the chromium is needed to absorb or react with 
gaseous poisons in the monomer. 
 
The impregnated support must be fluidized and activated for up to 12 h by 
heating in air at temperatures up to 500°–950°C.33 This removes adsorbed sur-
face water and decomposes some of the surface hydroxyl groups. Chromium 
(III) is oxidized to chromium (VI) by heating in air at temperatures above 
300°C. The low melting oxide is very mobile and reacts with surface hydroxyl 
groups to give siloxy- chromates. Siloxy chromates are stable at the higher tem-
peratures that are required to decompose more of the surface hydroxyl groups, 
and develop full activity. Dry air must be used during the thermal activation 
process, to avoid hydrolysis of the siloxy chromates to free chromium (VI) ox-
ide. Any free chromium (VI) is reduced to chromium (III) at temperatures ex-
ceeding 400°–500°C, and this must be avoided to achieve the best performance 
from the catalyst. More than 90% of the chromium is combined with silica fol-
lowing activation. Higher-temperature activation of the catalyst gives a lower 
range of molecular weight in polymers produced during use. 
 
8.3.2. Catalyst Reduction 
 
Subsequent to startup of the catalyst, there is an induction period during which 
active centers are formed as chromium (VI) is reduced to chromium (II) by the 
ethylene monomer.33 Alternatively, chromium can also be activated by pre-
reduction with carbon monoxide at temperatures above 600°C.34 This procedure 
results in an enhanced removal of surface hydroxyl groups from the support, 
with only producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen as by-products, in a reaction 
analogous to the water gas shift reaction: 
 
 
 
H2O + CO → CO2 + H2 
(8.1) 
 
The absence of water thus avoids the two problems of hydrolysis of the surface 
chromates and water-induced sintering of the support, both of which lead to a 
catalyst with lower activity. Reoxidation of the chromium after carbon monox-
ide reduction gives a different active site precursor, which produces a catalyst 
which gives a broader molecular weight distribution in the resulting polymer. 
Catalysts pre-reduced with carbon monoxide are more active than those reduced 
with ethylene in the reactor. 
 
8.3.3. Catalyst Operation 
 
Phillips catalysts were originally operated in solution or particle form (slurry) 
processes to produce HDPE, although the particle form process was preferred in 
1983.29 In the 1960s, following a lead by Phillips, licensees began to develop 
gas phase processes using mechanical agitation (BASF)35 or fluidized beds (Un-
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
325 
ion Carbide),35 both of which avoided agglomeration of the catalyst or the poly-
mer. 
 
The silica support of the chromium catalyst influences operation by control-
ling the formation of active centers. The activity of the catalyst increases at 
higher activation temperatures and the molecular weight of the polymer decreas-
es, which suggests that polymer propagation and chain termination are related to 
the decreasing density of hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. This may be a 
consequence of the way growing polymer chains interact with the surface hy-
droxyl groups, to favor chain growth.36 
 
The shape and pore size of the particles controlled the catalyst activity and 
molecular weight of the polymer chain in the early catalysts. The molecular 
weight distribution of the polymer could not be controlled very easily because of 
differences in the active sites. It is accepted that several different active centers 
can form with chromic oxide and silica and that the ease of reduction of each 
type depends on the operating temperature. Catalysts which have been activated 
at 850°C contain fewer active sites that seem to reduce easily. This supports the 
observation that these catalysts produce polymers with a narrow molecular 
weight distribution. In general, however, the molecular weight of the polymer 
decreases as the pore size of the catalyst increases. Pore size controls both per-
formance and selectivity. 
 
The most important practical property of the support is that it disintegrates 
as the polymer chains form within the catalyst pores. This is why preparation of 
the support to control particle size is so important. Fragmentation provides con-
tinuous access to the active sites inside the pores and must continue during oper-
ation. From examination of the fragments of catalyst in particles of polymer, it 
has been shown that the typical particle size is as small as 0.05–0.1 μm.37 De-
spite the need to fragment as pressure from the governing polymer chain devel-
ops within the pores, all supports must be physically strong to withstand attrition 
during handling. 
 
The ability to produce catalyst supports that could fragment led to the de-
velopment of high-productivity catalysts and processes in which de-ashing of 
the polymer was unnecessary. 
 
8.3.4. Catalyst Modifiers 
 
The ability to control molecular weight and molecular weight distribution is 
important in the development of new polymer products. It soon became apparent 
that the silica gel support could be modified by the addition of other components 
to make polymerization catalysts even more versatile. 
 
Oxides such as titania, zirconia, or alumina when co-gelled with silica can 
influence the pore structure and improve the stability of silica gel during the 
aging stage of preparation. It was also shown, however, that these oxides formed 
a variety of additional sites that provided extra catalyst activity and a wider 
326 
Chapter 8 
range of polymer densities. Silica could also be impregnated with precursors of 
the modifying oxides to achieve the same results.32 Residual surface hydroxyls 
groups on the support in activated catalysts could also be replaced by fluoride 
ions. This had an indirect effect on the active centers and led to the formation of 
a different range of polymers. 
 
8.3.4.1. Titanium 
 
Pre-dried silica gel was impregnated with a titanium ester that could be decom-
posed to give the necessary titanium content.38 The support could then be im-
pregnated with the appropriate chromium salt and activated by the normal pro-
cedure. The modified catalyst was more active and produced a bimodal, broader 
molecular weight distribution of polymers with a lower average molecular 
weight than that from an unmodified catalyst. A wide range of polymers with 
different molecular weight can be formed by variations in the titanium content. 
Catalysts containing more than about 8% titanium are, however, less thermally 
stable. Co-gelled titanium catalysts are more active than unmodified catalysts 
and produce lower-molecular-weight polymer.39 These catalysts are different 
from both the untreated and impregnated catalysts, because they produce a much 
narrower molecular weight distribution. The lower thermal stability of the co-
gelled catalyst requires that the titanium content is limited to about 4%. 
 
The different molecular weight distributions of polymers produced by tita-
nium-modified catalysts can be explained by the formation of different active 
sites40.  The presence of the less-electronegative titanium atom may lead to easi-
er reduction of the chromium sites.  An increased electron density at the chromi-
um atom could destabilize the chromium-carbon bond, giving higher catalytic 
activity and lower molecular weight of the polymers.  There is a higher surface 
concentration of titanium in impregnated catalysts (90%) than in co-gelled cata-
lysts (60%).  The impregnated catalysts therefore probably contain titanyl chro-
mate sites as well as the siloxyl chromate sites of unmodified catalysts.  This 
explanation is supported the observation of two exotherms in the temperature-
programmed reduction of impregnated catalyst. One at 440°C corresponds to the 
siloxyl chromate reduction peak of unmodified catalyst and a second at 420°C 
corresponds to titanyl chromate reduction.32 The two different active centers 
would lead to the bimodal distribution of the molecular weight of the polymer. 
 
On the other hand, the more homogeneous mixture of silica and titania in 
co-gelled catalysts may lead to the formation of a predominant third kind of site 
consisting of mixed silyl/titanyl chromates. These sites would then provide the 
narrow molecular weight distribution and other properties of the polymer 
formed.30 
 
 
 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
327 
8.3.4.2. Alumina and Zirconia 
 
Silica/chromia catalysts have also been modified by the incorporation of other 
oxides such as alumina41 or zirconia,42 by impregnating a silica support with 
zirconium acetylacetonate or aluminum sec-butoxide or co-gelling the silica gel 
with appropriate soluble salts.32 Zirconia-modified catalysts are similar to those 
with added titanium in their effect but have not been widely reported. Alumi-
num-modified catalysts have increased activity and provide lower-molecular-
weight polymers, but the procedure for their preparation is complicated. Neither 
type of catalyst is widely described in the literature but they are reported as con-
taining different active sites.43 
 
8.3.4.3. Fluorides 
 
The properties of silica/chromium catalysts can be modified indirectly by replac-
ing hydroxyl groups with fluorine atoms.44 Impregnation of the catalyst with 
ammonium hexafluorosilicate before activation causes the surface hydroxyl 
groups from the siloxane groups to react with the fluorine atoms and form sili-
con–fluorine bonds. This has been claimed to decrease the electron density at 
the chromium atoms and alter the distribution of active centers. These catalysts 
produce polymers with a narrow molecular weight distribution. Better co-
monomer incorporation results when titanium impregnated catalysts are modi-
fied with fluoride, and a higher-molecular-weight polymer is produced.42 
 
8.3.5. Use of Co-Catalysts 
 
The early Phillips catalysts only needed to be activated and reduced to generate 
active centers, but several patents since have described the use of co-catalysts to 
promote the production of LLDPE. For example, a typical catalyst that had been 
modified with titanium, activated in air and reduced in carbon monoxide was 
then further activated by addition of triethylboron prior to operation.45 This pro-
cedure led to the production of linear low density polyethylene, LLDPE, which 
had a density of 0.9726 g cm−3, directly, without the need for the addition of an 
α-olefin to the pure ethylene feed. Olefins were produced in situ and these were 
incorporated into the polyethylene. A second catalyst was made using silica with 
a very high pore volume, modified with titanium, activated in air, and finally 
reduced with carbon monoxide at 350°C. This catalyst was then treated with 
triethylboron before use. LLDPE polymers with densities in the range 0.890 to 
0.915 were obtained from a feedstock of ethylene and hexene-1, but the addition 
of some hydrogen to the gas stream was required to limit the length of the poly-
mer chain. 
 
Higher-molecular-weight HDPE polymers, with broad molecular weight 
distributions, can be made using an air-activated titanium-modified catalyst with 
328 
Chapter 8 
the addition of diethylboron ethoxide in the concentration range 2–10 ppm as 
co-catalyst. When a similar catalyst is used with the addition of triethylboron in 
the same range of concentrations, the density of the polymer decreases. This 
suggests that the presence of triethylboron leads to the formation of some α-
olefins and that these are incorporated into the HDPE to produce a polymer with 
a lower molecular weight, more analogous to LLDPE.47 
 
It has been possible to introduce many different polyethylene varieties with 
Phillips catalysts by modifying the silica surface or using co-catalysts, which 
will continue to allow a much wider use of chromium catalysts in the future. 
 
8.3.6. Organo-Chromium Catalysts 
 
Catalysts derived from organo-chromium compounds supported on silica gel are 
very different to the original Phillips chromium oxide catalyst. In the original 
catalysts one molecule of chromium oxide is bound to two silica units, to form 
the silyloxy chromate sites. In contrast, organo-chromium compounds are usual-
ly only bound to a single site on the silica support and the other coordination 
sites are still occupied by the organic ligands. For example, tris-π-allyl chromi-
um reacts with a hydroxylated support, with the evolution of propylene and the 
formation of a bis-π-allyl chromium siloxy derivative. 
 
The support for an organo-chromium catalyst must, therefore, be carefully 
calcined to lower the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, leaving a suffi-
ciently wide separation to avoid the possible linkage of the chromium to two 
units of silica.33 Excessive calcination has to be avoided as it removes too much 
water, leaving too few hydroxyl groups to achieve the required loading of chro-
mium. 
 
A new catalyst in which chromocene was supported on silica gel was de-
veloped by Union Carbide48 for use in gas-phase polymerization reactions. A 
typical catalyst contained about 2.5% by weight of chromium, and was activated 
by the addition of small amounts of alkylaluminium alkoxides, such as diethyl-
aluminium ethoxide. Use of such a catalyst formulation gave rise to a polymer 
with much narrower molecular weight distributions. The average molecular 
weight could be controlled by the addition of hydrogen, which caused termina-
tion of the growing chain. 
 
Other organo-chromium catalysts include those produced by the impregna-
tion of silica supports with diarene chromium species, chromium allyls, and 
bis(triphenyl) silyl chromate. These catalysts give very broad molecular weight 
distributions of the polymer. Branching in the polymer chains is often extensive, 
because low-molecular weight olefins are formed and can act as co-monomers. 
Polymer chain termination is usually by ß-hydrogen abstraction, leaving a ter-
minal double bond in the polymer chain. 
 
Mixed catalysts have been prepared by reaction of an activated chromium 
oxide silica catalyst with an organo-chromium compound. Mixed catalysts are 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
329 
very active and produce branched polymers with a low density.  The type of 
organochromium compound used in the catalyst controls the formation and 
isomerization of the olefins incorporated into the polymer chains,49 so influenc-
ing polymer density. 
8.4. OTHER CATALYSTS 
Standard Oil of Indiana used a molybdenum oxide/alumina catalyst that could 
be prepared either by co-precipitation or impregnation methods.50 The catalyst 
was activated by calcination in air at 500°C followed by reduction in hydrogen 
(or carbon monoxide) at a temperature in the range 450°–500°C, to give a prod-
uct in which the valency of the molybdenum was less than six. The catalyst 
needed to be activated using sodium alkyls, possibly because the catalyst was 
difficult to reduce. The original catalyst had a low productivity. Better results 
were obtained when the alumina support had been halogenated, and the process 
operated in the liquid phase at an operating temperature of 200°–275°C and a 
pressure of 35–100 bar. Although other modifications were made to the catalyst 
and the process, only three plants seem to have been built and operated. A dif-
ferent catalyst, based on vanadium pentoxide/alumina, was mentioned in some 
early publications but it was only slightly easier to activate than the molyb-
denum oxide/alumina catalysts.  Both molybdenum and vanadium oxides melt at 
higher temperatures than chromium trioxide, so consequently they are not as 
mobile on a silica surface.29 
8.5. POLYMERIZATION PROCESSES 
The first commercial process for the manufacture of polyethylene was commis-
sioned in 1939, and required pressures of 2000 bar and temperatures of 200°C. 
Free-radical initiators were used, and low-density polymer was formed as highly 
branched chains. In the 1950s, new processes which did not require the use of 
free-radial initiators, and which operated at low temperatures and low pressures 
ranging up to 40 bar, were introduced. Catalysts were used and a higher-density 
polyethylene with little or no chain branching was produced. 
 
Low-density polymers produced at high pressure became known as low-
density polyethylene (LDPE), while the higher-density, low-pressure polymer is 
now known as high-density polyethylene (HDPE). When α-olefin co-monomers 
were used with ethylene, the low-pressure polymer was less dense than HDPE 
as a result of regular branching in the polymer chain. The product is now known 
as linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). The approximate proportions of 
the different polyethylene types are shown in Table 8.5.

Polyethylene is now produced by several processes that are more conven-
ient and do not require the high capital investment and expertise associated with 
high-pressure operation. When catalysts were first introduced, the most widely 
used processes were based on solution or slurry operation, in which polymeriza-
tion took place on catalyst suspended in an inert liquid hydrocarbon. Since 1968, 
many new plants have used a gas phase process in which the catalyst and poly-
mer particles are suspended as a fluid bed, by the circulation of gaseous mono-
mer. An approximate estimate of the market share of each process by 1999 is 
given in Table 8.6. A typical plant for the production of polyethylene is shown 
in Figure 8.1. 
 
As demand for polyethylene has increased, there has been a continuous ef-
fort to improve catalyst activity. This was important to achieve high productivity 
at relatively short residence times. These properties have avoided the need to 
remove catalyst residues from the product. It was also important for polypropyl-
ene to have a high isotactic index to eliminate the need for equipment for the 
extraction of atactic polymer. 
 
Two features distinguish the use of modern polymerization catalysts. First, 
there is no separation of the catalyst from the product; second, the catalyst must 
be able to disintegrate, or fragment, during operation, to expose new active cen-
ters. Use of the original low-activity catalysts led to unacceptably high residues 
of transition metal, and in the case of Ziegler catalysts, halogen in the product, 
which had to be removed before the polymer could be sold. 
 
Reactor design is important and plug flow is essential to prevent both back 
mixing of reactants and to maintain a reasonable product quality. This require-
ment led to the use of long tubular reactors, or a number of small vessels operat-
ing in series. Newer gas phase processes are efficient in this respect and opera-
tion can be controlled to remove product of the appropriate size and molecular 
weight from the bottom of the fluid bed as it is formed. Another requirement of 
the processes is the need to control reactor temperature by removing the heat of 
reaction, so preventing the formation of low-molecular-weight polymers. High 
temperatures also lead to agglomeration of the product and deactivation of the 
catalyst. The reaction exotherm would lead to a rise in temperature of about 16C 
for every % of ethylene converted.

8.5.1. Slurry Processes 
 
In the slurry process,51 a solution of about 2–6 wt% of the monomers in solution 
in a hydrocarbon such as isobutane, n-pentane or n-hexane is slurred with the 
catalyst, and the polymerization proceeds in a loop reactor achieving conver-
sions 97%. Typical co-monomers with ethylene can be butene-1, hexene-1, 4-
methylpentene-1, and octene-1. The catalyst is suspended in the solution, which 
is then pumped as turbulent slurry through relatively narrow tubes. The polymer 
is essentially insoluble in the liquid diluent and forms a slurry containing up to 
30 wt% of small polymer particles, which are removed continuously. 
 
The operating temperature of the process must be below the melting or sof-
tening point of polymers and, depending on the type of polymer produced and 
the diluents used, is generally less than 100°C. A unique loop reactor was de-
signed by Phillips Petroleum Corporation to prevent the deposition of solids 
onto the reactor walls. It is reported that loop reactors have operated continuous-
ly for as long as three years without the need for cleaning.51 As an alternative, 
autoclave slurry reactors with efficient stirrers have been operated in batch or 
cascade processes. Changes in the partial pressure of the hydrogen moderator 
from one stage to another allow a range of different average molecular weights 
to be obtained within the product. Loop processes using Phillips chromium cata-
lysts operate at pressures in the range 20–40 bar, whereas autoclave processes 
operate with Ziegler catalysts at lower pressures. 
 
Residence times of up to 1 h are typical, with the continuous addition of 
monomer, catalyst, and fresh diluent. Productivity can exceed more than 10,000 
lb of polymer per pound of catalyst. The use of low concentrations of catalyst 
allows the grade of the product to be changed within a few hours. The average 
molecular weight of the product can be controlled by the type of catalyst used, 
the activation procedure, operating conditions, and by changing the partial pres-
sure of the hydrogen moderator.52 
 
8.5.2. Solution Processes 
 
In the solution process, polymerization takes place in solution, in a liquid hydro-
carbon such as cyclohexane or iso-octane, in which both the monomer and pol-
ymer can dissolve. About 0.2–0.6 wt% of a Ziegler catalyst is normally sus-
pended in the solvent, by stirring efficiently in a suitable reactor. The operating 
temperature must be above the melting point of the polymer but lower than the 
decomposition point of the catalyst. Typical temperatures are in the range 125–
175°C. 
 
The polymerization is carried out at a typical pressure of about 30 bar, and 
the solution of monomer and co-monomer is admitted into the reactor with fresh 
catalyst. After reaction, the solution containing some 10–20% of polymer is re-
moved from the top of the reactor. The spent catalyst taken from the reactor is 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
333 
largely deactivated and is separated from the solution. In some of the early ver-
sions of the process, the catalyst could be recycled, provided that it still pos-
sessed sufficient activity for this to be worthwhile. The viscosity of the solution 
needs to be sufficiently low to avoid circulation and pumping problems, and this 
requirement can limit the magnitude of the average molecular weight of poly-
mer. 
 
The residence time in the reactor is only a few minutes and the conversion 
of monomers usually exceeds 95%, depending on the concentrations of ethylene 
and polymer in the solution. Unused ethylene is recycled. This makes the pro-
cess very adaptable if it is necessary to change the grades of polymer at regular 
intervals. It is claimed that more than 500 tonnes of polymer can be produced 
per kilogram of titanium in the catalyst.53 The use of solution processes was re-
ported to be increasing and by 1990, represented up to 15% of world polyeth-
ylene production.54 
 
8.5.3. Gas Phase Process 
 
In the most successful process, the catalyst is fluidized in a large reactor by the 
circulation of gaseous olefin monomers at high space velocity.55 Polymerization 
takes place in the gas phase at pressures less than 20 bar and an operating tem-
perature in the range 80°–100°C, to ensure that the polymer does not soften. 
Conversion is limited to about 3% per pass. This allows circulation of the mon-
omers through external coolers to remove the heat of reaction while polymer and 
catalyst particles reside in the reactor for an average of 2–3 h. The largest poly-
mer particles gradually fall to the bottom of the fluid bed and are removed when 
the appropriate physical properties are achieved. Fresh catalyst is injected, often 
as a slurry, to make up for losses. An immediate attraction of the process is that 
the concentration of catalyst in the polymer is very low and the product does not 
have to be de-ashed. Other gas phase processes operate with vertical reactors, 
which use stirrers,56 and horizontal vessels which use weirs and paddles.57 
 
Gas phase polymerization is flexible and can produce a wider range of pol-
ymer grades than the earlier processes. Capital and operating costs are relatively 
low and the process has been very successful. Modern process developments 
include the injection of liquid hydrocarbon directly into the fluid bed, rather than 
to the recycle gas. 
 
This makes the process more economic by allowing better temperature con-
trol and increased conversion.53 This has become known as the condensation 
mode and can considerably increase the capacity of existing units. All types of 
active catalysts can be used.

8.6. METALLOCENE/SINGLE-SITE CATALYSTS 
In the early 1990s a new type of olefin polymerization catalyst was introduced. 
Catalyst derived from metallocenes give a polymer with a very narrow molecu-
lar weight distribution with regular inclusion of co-monomers in the growing 
chains. This was a significant improvement on the relatively wide molecular 
weight distribution and a variable co-monomer content of Ziegler–Natta prod-
ucts.58 Development has been slower than forecast owing to operational prob-
lems and the high cost of both metallocenes and the first methyl aluminoxane 
activator. However, the high level of industrial interest was demonstrated by 
350 patent applications by the end of 1993 increasing to 1500 by 1997. Compe-
tition led to litigation over patent rights, followed by a series of joint ventures 
between the important producers. By 2000, up to 2% of the total worldwide pol-
yethylene production was based on the use of metallocene, or single-site cata-
lysts, as they became more accurately described.59 This corresponded to about 1 
million tonnes of polymer. 
 
Exxon Chemicals tested their range of Exxpol catalysts in a demonstration 
plant at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1991.60 The unit had a capacity of 15,000 
tonnes of polyethylene per year using an autoclave type of reactor. The plant 
was operated in the temperature range 100°–300°C and a pressure in the range 
1000–2000 bar, using the monomer as a supercritical fluid solvent. These condi-
tions led to the inclusion of a co-monomer into the polyethylene, over a wide 
range of molecular weights. A second, gas phase plant, was then retrofitted at 
Mont Belvieu, Texas. It was found that plant capacities could be increased with 
the new catalysts. 
 
The Exxon catalyst is a derivative of cyclopentadiene, indene, or fluorene 
which may be bridged, and which may also be substituted with up to five differ-
ent atoms or radicals. This organic group is bonded to a metal atom from Group 
IV b of the Periodic Table, titanium, zirconium or hafnium, which has been acti-
vated by addition of a strong Lewis acid, to give a cationic structure. 
 
In 1993, Dow Chemicals started operation using its Insite catalyst for a so-
lution process, in Freeport, Texas61, producing a copolymer of ethylene contain-
ing octene-1 co-monomers as well as plastomers. A second plant in Tarrogona, 
Spain, began operation in 1996. The Dow catalyst consists of a Group-IV transi-
tion metal (titanium, zirconium, hafnium) covalently bonded to a substituted 
monocyclopentadienyl group bridged with a heteroatom such as nitrogen. The 
components form a “constrained cyclic structure with the metal center.” Other 
companies, including BASF, Hoechst, and Phillips, were also testing single-site 
catalysts by 1995.

8.6.1. Early Development 
 
Although single-site catalysts were only used industrially beginning in 
1991/1993, they were not really new. In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, the 
Ballard group62 at ICI Corporate lab studied a range of π-ally derivatives63 of 
transition metals, such as zirconium and chromium, and benzyl derivatives of 
titanium and zirconium as potential candidates for olefin polymerization cata-
lysts. Relatively high activities were found, particularly when the π-ally or ben-
zyl derivative were reacted with a support, though all of the derivatives showed 
significant activity as pure compounds in hydrocarbon solutions. This work 
showed significant promise, but in the end, was never commercialized. Even 
earlier, about 1953, both Natta64 (Montedison) and Breslow65 (Hercules) had 
investigated the catalytic potential of metallocenes during mechanistic studies 
on ethylene insertion. At the time they used a typical activator such as diethyl 
aluminium chloride to produce the metallocene cation intermediate in two ion-
forming steps:66

(8.3) 
 
Unfortunately the forward reaction equilibrium was unfavorable and the catalyst 
had a low activity.67 
 
In later experiments, it was shown that the metallocene catalysts had higher 
activity when traces of water were present during the preparation of the catalyst. 
This is in direct contrast with the use of the original Ziegler Natta catalysts, for 
which the rigorous exclusion of water was essential. This observation was linked 
by Breslow to the formation of aluminoxanes by the hydrolysis of the alky alu-
minium derivative.69 
 
The activation of zirconacenes by high molecular weight aluminoxanes de-
rivatives led to the development of active and stable catalysts for the polymeri-
zation of ethylene. High yields of polymers with molecular weights in the range 
103 to 1.5x106, depending on operating temperature, are now produced.70 The 
high-molecular weight methyl aluminoxane alkylates the zirconacenes and con-
verts the product into a cationic complex: 
 
 
 Cp2ZrRX  +  MAO  +  Olefin → Cp2ZrR(Olefin)+.MAOX 
(8.4) 
 
 
A 200-fold excess of MAO (methyl aluminoxane) was originally needed to 
provide a reasonable active catalyst. By the late 1990s, this proportion had been 
reduced to about 20. It was later realized that the active species in the catalyst 
formulation was a cation. This led to the replacement of the aluminoxanes spe-
336

cies by compounds that could provide a source of a suitable non-coordinating 
anion, such as tetrakispentafluorophenylborate:71 
 
     Cp2ZrMe2 + PhN+Me2HB(C6F5)4 → Cp2ZrMe+B(C6F5)4 + PhNMe2 + CH4 
 
 
 
(8.5) 
 
 
The first metallocene catalyst (Cp2MCl2.MAO) was completely nonstereo-
specific for the polymerization of propylene and the polymer was atactic. It was 
then shown that when the catalyst structure was modified by replacing the halo-
gen atoms with phenyl groups (Cp2MPh2.MAO) the catalyst became stereospe-
cific at a temperature of –30°C.72 
 
Ansa metallocenes* were the first soluble, stereospecific, single-site cata-
lysts to be produced and were based on indenyl groups73 [racemic tetrahydroeth-
ylene (1-indenyl)2ZrCl2]. By variations in the substitution of the indene group it 
was possible, with a MAO activator, to match the performance of the third-
generation magnesium chloride–supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts.74 In quantita-
tive terms, this was equivalent to the production of about 1 tonne of polypropyl-
ene per gram of transition metal, with an isotactic index greater than 99% and 
molecular weight up to at least 500,000 g.mol−1.75 
 
 
8.6.2. Early Development 
 
 
A single-site catalyst is made up of three components: 
• The catalyst framework is usually a pair of organic ring compounds or 
ligands, linked by a bridging group. The rings can be substituted with var-
ious organic groups to modify the electronic properties of the catalyst 
sites to produce the specific grades of polymer as required. Common lig-
ands include radicals from compounds such as cyclopentadiene, indene, 
fluorene and benzidene. Other ligands include imido-compounds, and 
some organo-phosphine derivatives, with bridges formed from organosil-
icon groups and a wide range of organic compounds such as ethylene. 
The ligand pairs are held in the form of an asymmetric V-shape, de-
scribed as the ansa form (ansa is Latin for bent handle)76 and are able to 
form stereospecific catalyst sites. 
• A transition metal halide from the sub-group titanium, zirconium, and 
hafnium is coordinated between the ligand pairs. This provides a rigid, 
potentially stereo-selective framework that controls the access of mono-
mers to the active site. 
• The use of a co-catalyst to generate the active catalytic cationic centers is 
required. Derivatives of methyl aluminoxanes, salts containing the 
                                                            
* An ansa metallocene is one in which ligand pairs are attached to the form of an asymmetric V-
shape. 
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
337 
tetrakis-pentafluorophenylborate anion, other non-coordinating anions or 
trispentafluorophenylaluminium can be used. 
Some processes are based upon soluble catalysts but gas phase and slurry pro-
cesses use about 1–2 wt% catalyst impregnated onto a suitable form of silica. 
Changes to the catalyst structure can modify catalytic activity, the molecular 
weight of the product, and the incorporation of co-monomers in the polymeriza-
tion of ethylene. In the production of polypropylene, structural changes within 
the catalyst also direct the formation of isotactic, syndiotactic, and non-
crystalline atactic polymers.77 Better control of the polymerization process was 
therefore possible, as shown in Table 8.7. 
 
The following general observations have been made: 
• The presence of silicon bridges within the catalyst leads to an increase in 
the molecular weight, and a small increase in stereospecificity of the pol-
ymer. Longer bridges decrease both molecular weight and stereospecifici-
ty. 
• Phenyl substitution within the bridge gives a further increase in molecular 
weight. 
• In the case of catalysts based on indene, substitution of the both the in-
denyl group and the bridge gives an increase in molecular weight. 
• Substitution of the indene ring with phenyl or naphthyl groups, and sub-
stitution of the bridge with alkyl groups leads polymer with a high mo-
lecular weight and stereospecificity. 
 
Asymmetric single-site catalysts have been produced from bridged fluo-
renylcyclopentadienyl rings with alkyl substitution in both the bridge and the 
cyclopentadiene ring. These modifications can lead to control over the alterna-
tion of isotactic and syndiatactic sequences in the polymer and, consequently,

a Many other catalysts have been introduced for the polymerization of propylene to produce a range 
of different structures ranging from isotactic, syndiotactic, to hemi-isotactic and isotac-
tic/syndiotactic sequences. These include catalysts based on a bridged cyclopentadiene/ﬂuorene 
methyl-substituted ligand framework that can alternate the substitution of ethylene and propylene in 
copolymers.

properties of the polymer. An typical catalyst contains a bridged fluorenyl-
cyclopentadienyl framework, with a methyl group substituted in the 3-position 
of the cyclopentadiene ring. The bridging group can consist of a -CMe2- or  
-SiMe2- group.74 
 
8.6.3.  Industrial Operation 
 
The initial reluctance to introduce single-site catalysts was due to the high costs 
of the catalysts and the methyl aluminoxane activator, as well as difficulties in 
the processing of the new polymer with existing equipment. By 1995, the ratio 
of the aluminoxanes required to activate the catalyst had fallen from about 200 
to 20, thus offering a significant reduction in costs, and new activators based on 
non-coordinating anions (NCA) were being developed. 
 
From 1995 the new catalysts, now known as single-site catalysts, were de-
veloped and many new structures were introduced. This was particularly true 
with catalysts used to produce a range of polypropylenes with new and different 
properties and to introduce long-chain co-monomers. A feature of the new pol-
ymers was a narrow range in the molecular weight distribution. By combining 
different single-site catalysts, a wider range of molecular weight distribution 
could be provided. The synthesis of single-site catalysts has been simplified and 
is now the domain of the specialist chemical companies. Catalyst costs have 
been reduced from about two cents per pound of polymer in 1993/1994 to 0.4 
cents in 1998, compared with 0.2 cents for the older Ziegler–Natta types.78 This 
reduction in overall catalyst cost is a result of both a reduction in the costs of 
making the catalysts and increases in the productivities of these catalysts. By 
1998 it was estimated that 2–4 tonnes of the organometallic component of sin-
gle-site catalysts could supply about 500,000 tonnes of polymer. 
 
8.6.4. Catalyst Activators 
 
Methyl aluminoxanes activate metallocene catalysts by alkylation of the metal-
locene precursor, forming a cationic complex of the type, Cp2ZrR(olefin)+. 
When these catalysts were first used, a very large excess of the aluminoxanes 
was required, but the need for such a large excess has now been removed. MAO 
is formed by the controlled reaction of a limited quantity of water with tri-
methylaluminium. Normally, water reacts with explosive violence with Me3Al, 
to give methane and a hydroxylated form of aluminium oxide or aluminium hy-
droxide when an excess of water is used. However, by careful control of the 
reaction conditions, an intermediate degree of hydrolysis can be achieved. The 
product of reaction is a polymeric molecule, with a spherical shape, and has the 
formula (Al4O3(Me)6)4.Al(Me)3. The MAO molecule contains a single unit of 
trimethylaluminium, and further reaction with methyl groups produces the com-
 
Olefin Polymerization Catalysts 
339 
plex anion, (Al17O12(Me3)28)−. Any excess trimethylaluminium can be extracted 
with diethyl ether.79 
 
There is a tendency for the equilibrium between the complexes to be re-
versed, in polymerizations which use MAO as the activator. So-called ion equi-
librium deactivation led to a reduction in the productivity of the catalyst, and a 
large excess of activator was required to maintain performance. It is now known 
that the active form of the catalyst is a cation formed in an equilibrium reaction 
during the activation stage, and more stable activators have since been devel-
oped. These can react irreversibly with the metallocene by the abstraction of 
anionic ligands during the alkylation step and thus generate a large non-
coordinating anion, (NCA), that stabilizes the cationic catalytic species formed. 
The NCA must be large, inert to the catalytic cation, and have its negative 
charge localized within the structure. A most important feature is that it is labile 
and easily displaced by ethylene or propylene during the polymerization pro-
cess. 
 
The first NCA precursor to be identified was tetrafluoroboric acid, although 
this was not sufficiently labile to generate an active catalyst.80 More efficient 
NCA precursors were later developed and included tri-n-butylammonium 
tetrakispentafluorophenyl 
borate 
and 
N,N-dimethylanilinium 
tetrakis-
pentafluoro-phenyl borate., each used in a 1:3 molar ratio with the metallocene. 
Compounds such as these were of critical importance in the optimization of the 
catalyst.81 
 
As the demand for new polymers increased, catalysts with two active sites 
per molecule were developed. It was found that tris-pentafluorophenyl-
aluminium, (C6F5)3Al, could be used to replace the borate derivatives, and when 
used in conjunction with the typical transition metallocene catalyst precursors, a 
series of di-cationic derivatives of titanium and zirconium could be produced.  
Work in Dow showed that these di-cationic catalysts were up to 30 times more 
reactive than boron activated catalysts, while still producing polymers with the 
same molecular weight and melting point.82 
 
8.6.5. Molecular Weight Control 
 
An early objective in the development of single-site catalysts was an increase in 
the molecular weight of the polymers formed. The polymerization process can 
be thought of as happening in three discrete steps, namely initiation, propagation 
and termination. The final molecular weight of the polymer is determined by the 
relative rates of the propagation and termination stages. The rate of propagation 
could be increased by the substitution of appropriate organic groups into the 2-
position of the ligand rings, and by the introduction of bridging atoms or groups 
between the ligands. Typical processes of chain termination include abstraction 
of hydrogen from the ß-position of the growing chain to produce a polymer 
340 
Chapter 8 
molecule with a double bond at the end of the chain, and chain transfer with 
monomer to start a new chain. 
 
The original metallocene catalyst, Cp2ZrCl2/MAO, produced a polymer 
with a molecular weight of less than 5000 g mol-1. At 50oC, by using a single-
site catalyst, ethylene (1-indenyl)2ZrCl2/MAO, the molecular weight of the pol-
ymer could be increased to about 50,000 g mol−1.82 
 
The ability to produce a wide range of polymers with different molecular 
weights is useful and ethylene oligomers are, of course, produced by the Aufbau 
reaction and SHOP process. Single-site catalysts are now able to provide a range 
of stereospecific oligomers of propylene to replace or extend the use of current 
petrochemical processes (Chapter 7). They are used as α-olefins or as intermedi-
ates in the manufacture of surfactants.83 
 
8.6.6. New Catalyst Developments 
 
New catalysts have been introduced since 1995 as a result of cooperation be-
tween industry and academia. DuPont and Professor Brookhart from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina discovered active nickel and palladium cationic complex-
es based on bulky di-imine ligands that formed catalysts in conjugation with a 
suitable activator.84 Chain migration can be encouraged or restricted to produce 
extensive chain branching or chain growth, by variations in the operating tem-
perature and pressure. This can lead to a wide range of polymer densities. Nickel 
catalysts are produced more easily than single-site catalysts and provide the ba-
sis for DuPont’s Versipol technology. 
 
Later, in 1998, the same group, and, independently, BP Chemicals working 
with Imperial College, London, discovered tridentate iron(II) and cobalt(II) 
complexes with 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl ligands that could be activated with 
MAO. The activity of the catalysts was as high as that of the single site polyeth-
ylene catalysts available at that time. Polypropylene and a wide range of other  
α-olefin polymers could also be produced with appropriate catalyst modifica-
tions.85 
 
In a flashback to the early Ziegler experiments, a group at the University of 
California at Santa Barbara prepared organo-nickel catalysts that, when activat-
ed with the tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl borate anion, can produce butene-1 by the 
dimerization of ethylene, selectively at low temperatures and pressures. When 
the same nickel complex was combined with a conventional Dow-type single-
site catalyst and the same NCA activator, a range of branched polyethylenes 
could be produced which varied according to the nickel/titanium ratio.86 Other 
developments introduced by Professor Grubbs from the California Institute of 
Technology include neutral, single component nickel catalysts that do not re-
quire co-catalysts. These were based on the Shell SHOP catalysts, in which the 
phosphine ligand was replaced by the bulky salicylaldiamine molecule. Poly-

mers with an average molecular weight greater than 250,000, few chain branch-
es, and a narrow molecular weight distribution could be produced.86 
8.7. THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF POLYOLEFINS 
The polymerization of olefins proceeds by the regular insertion of successive 
monomer units into the growing head to tail chain, and the stereochemical con-
figuration of the growth reaction can be controlled by asymmetric carbon cen-
ters. This is particularly important for polypropylene, because the crystalline 
isotactic form is required, and each tertiary carbon (methyl group) must have the 
same orientation along the chain. Each propylene molecule must be adsorbed by 
the catalyst in an identical position on the active site with respect to the growing 
chain. This requires the same alignment of each secondary carbon atom in the 
double bonds during the cis insertion. The presence of uniformly active catalyst 
sites is desirable for both ethylene and propylene polymerization reactions but is 
not easy to achieve. The quantity of active sites that formed on the lateral crystal 
faces of α- and γ-titanium trichloride in the early catalysts was increased by 
grinding to give δ-titanium trichloride, and later by supporting titanium tetra-
chloride on magnesium chloride together with a suitable electron donor. The use 
of electron donors led to fewer inactive sites and greater stereoregularity in the 
polymer. The active sites on the catalysts still displayed differences, but in gen-
eral, the polymers showed much less variations in the molecular weights. The 
application of metallocene compounds has resulted in the development of single 
site catalysts which can achieve excellent control over the average molecular 
weight, the molecular weight distribution, and the stereoregularity of the poly-
mer. 
 
8.7.1. Formation of Polymer Chains 
 
The Cossee–Arlman mechanism for the polymerization of olefins is the most 
widely accepted theory but as yet it is not complete.87 Cossee developed his ear-
ly ideas of polyethylene growth at a titanium–carbon bond and supported the 
theory by molecular orbital calculations.88 The role of the alkyl aluminium co-
catalyst was in the generation of the active species, via the alkylation of the tita-
nium chloride bonds, and to remove impurities in both the gas stream and cata-
lyst preparative procedure. There was also the suggestion that it might be in-
volved in the insertion of each monomer molecule, and also in the regeneration 
of dormant sites or the formation of new active sites. 
 
Titanium atoms on the lateral faces or edges of the α-TiCl3 crystals may be 
adjacent to vacant chlorine sites within the crystal structure. The active site is 
then formed when the titanium chloride bond is alkylated by the reaction with 
the alkylaluminium co-catalyst. This results in the formation of a titanium-
342 
Chapter 8 
carbon bond, adjacent to the vacancy. Olefin molecules, such as ethylene and 
propylene, can then co-ordinate with the vacant site, forming a γ-complex, 
which leads to a weakening of both the double bond of the olefin and the titani-
um-carbon bond itself. The olefin can then insert into the titanium-carbon bond, 
creating a new alkyl group of higher molecular weight, and thus initiating the 
polymerization reaction, but also regenerating the vacancy at which the olefin 
had originally been coordinated. Successive olefin molecules could then com-
plex in turn with the vacancy, and thus propagate the growth reaction. 
 
It has been shown by experiments using deuterium labeling of the propyl-
ene, that stereospecific polymerization of α-olefins to the isotactic form requires 
that the α-olefin is complexed to the active center in a cis- configuration.89 The 
orientation of the olefin monomer can thus be arranged in the same relative posi-
tion as the previous monomers in the growing chain. It is possible that other 
exposed titanium atoms may be converted to give active isotactic sites by the 
migration of the polymer chain, caused by steric overcrowding of surrounding 
chlorine atoms.90 The different structural forms of polypropylene are described 
in Table 8.8. 
 
8.7.2. Polymer Chain Termination 
 
The growth of the polymer chain can be terminated by various reactions, and 
some procedures have been developed to stop the chain growth as a means of 
controlling the molecular weight of the polymer.91 Some of these reactions are 
shown below: 
• ß-hydrogen abstraction: 
 
 
 
[Cat]−CH2−CH2−Pn → [Cat]−H  +  CH2=CH−Pn 
(8.6)

Spontaneous termination by ß-hydrogen abstraction is less typical with 
Ziegler–Natta catalysts than with Phillips catalysts, because of the low  
temperature of operation at 60°–80°C. It can be induced at a higher tem-
perature, however, and results in the formation of vinyl and vinylidene 
end groups. The polymer chain can also exchange with the monomer to  
form a new active center, with the release of free polymer, in a process  
known as chain transfer. 
• Reaction with molecular hydrogen: 
 
 
 
[Cat]−Pn + H2 → [Cat]−H + H−Pn 
(8.7) 
 
Both Hercules92 and Montecatini93 have shown that hydrogen can act as a 
transfer agent for Ziegler–Natta catalysts and it can restore the active  
site. It is necessary to be able to control the magnitude of the molecular 
weight so that the resulting polymers can be processed more easily. The  
use of molecular hydrogen can be applied to all types of catalyst. The mo-
lecular weight of the polymer is approximately proportional to the square 
root of the partial pressure of the added hydrogen.94 A typical example of 
the effect of the hydrogen concentration on the molecular weight of poly-
propylene is shown in Table 8.9. The results are taken from a stirred bed 
gas phase process at 70°C using a TiCl4/MgCl2/di-isobutyl phthalate, sili-
ca-supported catalyst with an AlEt3and dialkyldimethoxysilane co-
catalyst.95 
• Metal alkyls: 
 
 
 
[Cat]−Pn + ZnEt2 → [Cat]−Et + EtZnPn 
(8.8) 
 
This method was also introduces by Montecatini,92 and the rate of chain 
termination was dependent upon the concentration of the alkyl. The al-
kylated catalyst was still active, but the polymer chain contained zinc res-
idues and the addition of further qualities of diethyl zinc was constantly 
required. The same effect could be achieved by the addition of more co-
catalyst but this was not as effective, possibly because triethyl aluminium 
exists as a dimer, and can form a complex with the catalyst. In the case of 
chain termination with the Phillips catalyst, the addition of cyclopentadi-
ene was effective.

• Proton donors: Chain transfer and chain termination are also possible us-
ing proton donors. However, the use of this method  is limited by the high  
probability that any proton donor would deactivate the catalyst complete-
ly and that further chain initiation would not be possible. 
 
The use of molecular hydrogen to control the molecular weight of the pol-
ymer has been the most important method to date, particularly in the polymeri-
zation of propylene. The polymer chains growing on catalysts derived from me-
tallocenes, however, appear to be terminated by β-hydrogen abstraction and the 
molecular weight can be controlled by the design of the ligand framework.83 
 
8.7.3. Molecular Weight 
 
The variations in the chain length of the polymers produced by different types of 
catalysts arise because of several different reasons, as shown below: 
• Different active sites on the catalyst operate at different rates of reaction. 
• The sites on the catalyst are not necessarily all active at the same time. 
• The ratio of the rate of propagation to the rate of termination changes as 
the length of the polymer chain increases. 
• The chain growth reaction is retarded as the active center is covered by 
growing polymer. 
• The chain termination reaction can be retarded if the hydrogen or metal 
alkyl used to control the molecular weight of the polymer is unable to ac-
cess the active site for chain transfer. 
 
To define a polymer structure completely, the following properties are im-
portant: 
• Average molecular weight. 
• Molecular weight distribution. 
• Distribution and type of branching within each polymer chain. 
 
A broad molecular weight distribution gives a high polymer density with 
better alignment of chains in the crystals, whereas a narrower molecular weight 
distribution gives lower density with more tangling of the chain. The insertion of 
co-monomers can provide some control over density by disrupting the crystalli-
zation of the polymer. When co-monomers are introduced, they may be more 
easily inserted at different sites. Insertion is retarded as the chain length of the 
polymer increases. 
 
The average molecular weight of a given polymer has a different value ac-
cording to the method by which the measurement was made. The weight aver-
age molecular weight (Mω), is measured by light scattering, or by gel permeation 
chromatography, whereas the number average molecular weight (Man), can be 
measured relatively easily by ebullioscopy, or by measurement of the osmotic

pressure of the solution. The ratio, Mω/Man is used to define the molecular 
weight distribution. The melt index, a measure of the ease of extruding heated 
polymer through a standard die under controlled conditions, also gives an indi-
cation of the range of the molecular weight. 
 
In practical terms, the useful range of molecular weights for a commercial 
polymer is from 30,000 to 1,000,000 g mol−1. Below 30,000, the softening point 
of the polymer tends to be too low, and the properties of polymers with a molec-
ular weight above the higher limit are beyond the capacity of most powder ex-
trusion equipment. The range of properties of some typical polyolefins is shown 
in Table 8.10. 
 
Since the introduction of Ziegler–Natta and Phillips catalysts, polyolefin 
processes are now used to produce a broad range of commercial polymers with 
controlled molecular weight. The use of a variety of catalysts can control the 
density of the polyolefin and its processing properties. All typical operating 
modes—slurry, solution, and gas phase—are used to satisfy market demands 
while allowing rapid changeover from one polymer grade to another. 
“Dr Ziegler himself explained that his discovery was not the direct out-
come of attempts to solve a set problem. He set out simply to follow a 
broad course of study in which ‘my only guide was initially just the de-
sire to do something which gave me pleasure’. This course threw up 
many interesting conclusions, some of them of highly practical value, 
and one of these led ultimately to a method of making polyethylene.”96

SYNTHESIS GAS 
 
 
 
Synthesis gas is a general term used in the chemical industry to describe a given 
feedstock. Unfortunately the term means different gas compositions to different 
groups of people and this can lead to confusion. In this chapter, the term synthe-
sis gas is used to describe the gaseous feed used specifically for the manufacture 
of ammonia. 
The replacement of charcoal by coke in the smelting of iron ores was a key 
step in establishing coal as a primary raw material for the manufacture of chem-
icals. Coke was produced via the destructive distillation of coal. The by-
products included Town Gas, and a wide range of organic and inorganic com-
pounds which could be used in a variety of ways. Coal gas was used for domes-
tic illumination and, until natural gas became widely available, gas works were 
important catalyst users mainly for gas purification. Coal tar contained organic 
chemicals which were developed as intermediates in catalytic processes by the 
emerging chemical industry. Ammonium sulfate was also recovered from the 
process, and this became an important source of nitrogenous fertilizer. It was 
also used in conjunction with phosphates that were extracted from phosphate 
rock with sulfuric acid, to produce compound fertilisers. Prior to the recovery of 
ammonia from coke ovens, it was only available from natural wastes. Conse-
quently, up to about 1920, most nitric acid was made from nitrates imported 
from South America (Chile saltpetre), even though it was already known that 
nitrates could be prepared via the catalytic oxidation of ammonia. By this time, 
the coal-based water gas and producer gas processes for the manufacture of 
town gas had been adapted to provide the synthesis gas needed for the Haber 
process, and thus coal became the principal raw material for the manufacture of 
ammonia.

9.1 AMMONIA SYNTHESIS GAS 
The importance of synthetic ammonia, when it was first produced by BASF in 
1913, cannot be over emphasized.1 Early development of the Haber process and 
the widespread use of ammonia throughout the world will be described in Chap-
ter 10. 
 Since the successful commissioning of the first plant, the Haber-Bosch 
process for the manufacture of ammonia has required increasingly large volumes 
of synthesis gas as the demand, initially for explosives, and subsequently, ferti-
lizers continued to grow. For about 20 years, synthesis gas was made mainly 
from coke in water gas and producer gas units, as shown empirically below:

(9.1) 
  
  
2 C  +  O2  +  4 N2 Æ  2 CO + 4 N2    
exothermic  
(9.2) 
  
The oxides of carbon are poisons to the iron-based ammonia synthesis cata-
lyst and must be removed from the synthesis gas before use. An important reac-
tion that affected the economics of the manufacture of synthesis gas was the 
conversion of carbon monoxide into equal volumes of hydrogen and carbon di-
oxide by reaction with steam. This procedure, now commonly referred to as the 
water-gas shift reaction required a catalyst based on iron and chromium oxides. 
 
  
CO  +  H2O  Æ  CO2 + H2 
(9.3) 
 
 The carbon dioxide was washed out of the process gas with water at high 
pressure and could eventually be recovered as a useful byproduct. Residual car-
bon monoxide was usually removed with an ammoniacal copper solution before 
the final stage of ammonia synthesis. 
The discovery of a shift catalyst by BASF was an important part of the pro-
cess development because it recovered the potential hydrogen from carbon 
monoxide.2 Originally known as the BAMAG method (Berlin Anhaltische Mas-
chinenbau Aktien Gesellschaft) the process has been used in every subsequent 
major ammonia plant. There have been few changes in the catalyst since the first 
application in 1914, other than more complete removal of impurities introduced 
during catalyst manufacture, such as sodium and sulfate ions, and the use of 
more stable formulations at increasingly high operating pressure. Operating 
conditions for the first shift unit at Oppau are summarized in Table 9.1 and must 
be amongst the first to be reported in the early literature.3

The strategic importance of ammonia, particularly in the production of ex-
plosives, led to competitive processes being developed in other parts of Europe 
and North America. From the mid-1920s onward, it became clear that the 
worldwide demand for fertilizers was becoming stagnant and further large-scale 
expansion in capacity was not justified. This meant that process improvements 
were delayed and even as late as 1937 the huge German wartime plants were 
still providing about 70% of worldwide ammonia requirements.4 Typical ammo-
nia plant capacity during this period was only 50–150 tonnes per day. 
 
9.1.1 Process Developments 
 
As a result of the post-war slump in the 1920’s, there was a momentum in both 
Germany and the United Kingdom to be able to use surplus high-pressure 
equipment in more effective ways. For example, the high-pressure catalytic pro-
cess for the hydrogenation of coal, introduced by Bergius in 1913, was eventual-
ly commercialized. However, the coal hydrogenation process provided not only 
the anticipated liquid hydrocarbons to be used as gasoline but also large volumes 
of byproduct off-gas. 
 Efforts were then made to improve the overall efficiency of the process 
by using the off-gas as a feedstock for the manufacture of hydrogen, to reduce 
the use of coke in the ammonia process. These efforts led to work on hydrocar-
bon steam reforming. A practical steam reforming process, using a solid nickel 
catalyst in a simple tubular furnace, was soon developed by BASF. The process 
was used for the first time by Standard Oil of New Jersey, during 1931, at their 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Bay Way, New Jersey,5 refineries in early work on 
the hydrocracking of gas oil to produce gasoline. During full scale operation of 
354 
 Chapter 9 
 
the steam reforming process, it was observed that the nickel catalysts suffered 
from poisoning by sulfur compounds still present in the feed gas, and from the 
deposition of carbon caused by olefin impurities. An improved furnace design, 
containing tubes packed with a better nickel catalyst in the form of raschig rings, 
was introduced by ICI in 1936 to make hydrogen from their own petrol plant 
off-gas.6 The catalyst was protected from poisons by desulfurizing the feed with 
zinc oxide granules. Later on a cobalt molybdate catalyst was used, together 
with the zinc oxide, to decompose the less reactive organic sulfur compounds. 
By the 1940s it was recognized that methane could also be an excellent feed for 
steam reformers in hydrogen or ammonia plants close to sources of natural gas. 
Once again the onset of war led to an increased demand for ammonia and 
several ordnance plants, using the ICI methane steam reforming process, were 
built in North America.7 These plants used the latest tubular reformer design, 
with zinc oxide for feed desulfurization, and the raschig ring nickel catalyst sup-
ported on a cement based refractory. It is probable that the plants also included a 
reforming vessel, with raschig ring nickel catalyst, to burn some of the hydrogen 
in reformed gas with air to add nitrogen and produce synthesis gas.8 Since a sec-
ondary reformer became part of the process, the original steam reforming fur-
nace has been called the primary reformer. The only other catalysts used in these 
early plants were the original HTS catalyst, for the water gas shift reaction, and 
an ammonia synthesis catalyst. 
 From 1950, the demand for nitrogen fertilizers in North America led to 
the construction of many more ammonia plants all based on the steam reforming 
process. Modifications to the primary reforming catalysts by the incorporation 
of potash to reduce the level of carbon deposition have enabled operators in 
those parts of the World with no readily available supply of natural gas to use 
naphtha or refinery off-gases as feed for the primary reformer, and this has in-
creased the versatility of the process even further.9 
 
9.1.2 Increased Ammonia Production by Steam Reforming 
 
Since 1945 the capacity of ammonia plants has grown to more than 2000 tonnes 
per day and the operating pressure of the steam reformer has been increased 
from atmospheric to about 30–40 atmospheres. 
 As the production capacity of ammonia plants grew from 50-100 tonnes 
per day up to 2000 tonnes per day the process was considerably improved. A 
more efficient furnace design was required which incorporated improved steel 
alloys able to operate at higher pressure. At the increased operating pressure, 
silica is volatile in steam. This required that the original catalysts, which were 
made by precipitation and which were based on hydrous silica cements, needed 
to be replaced by a new range of nickel-impregnated, silica-free catalysts. By 
1966  large capacity,  high-pressure single stream plants producing  up  to  1000 
tons per day of ammonia were being built all over the world. These plants, how-
 
Synthesis Gas 
  
355
ever, had evolved in stages as a range of new catalysts and equipment which 
could operate a higher pressure became available. 
Different versions of primary reforming and HTS catalysts, together with 
several new catalysts able to withstand the severe operating conditions, were 
gradually introduced. The rapid development of these new catalysts, designed 
for complex plants, led to an increase in the number of chemical engineering 
contracting companies able to supply off the peg process design and an extensive 
catalyst technical service for operators. Commodity catalysts were soon available 
from a number of specialist catalyst companies, which were not always in the in 
the ammonia business themselves. These companies needed to carry out their 
own catalyst research and plant design, so that such activities were no longer the 
preserve of the large chemical companies, other than when processes were pro-
vided under a strict license agreement. Intense competition developed among the 
new suppliers for the provision of new catalysts to independent operators, in 
what became a large and profitable business sector. A consequence of the rapid 
catalyst development, which was needed to solve operational problems, was that 
most of the competing catalyst suppliers evolved somewhat different production 
procedures and catalyst formulations. 
The more severe process conditions that were being developed imposed 
greater stresses, both physical and chemical, on the catalysts and the economic 
penalty of premature catalyst failure required that catalyst reliability was of par-
amount importance in successful plant operation. Improvements in the testing of 
catalysts was needed to provide a better understanding of the various modes of 
catalyst failure, to meet the exacting standards now required by the users. 
The major process changes and the new catalyst types which have been in-
troduced since 1920 are listed in Table 9.2. Relatively slow technical develop-
ments from 1920 up to about 1950 correspond to the period when coal was the 
source of synthesis gas. Rapid changes between 1950 and 1970 reflect the ex-
pansion of the fertilizer and chemical industries as crude oil, natural gas, and 
petrochemicals became so important. Increasing the level of fertilizer production 
from natural gas was just as crucial as the new range of petrochemical products 
supporting the tremendous increase in world population. 
9.2  MODERN AMMONIA PLANTS 
Up to eight different catalysts and absorbent materials are regularly used in a 
modern ammonia plant to produce synthesis gas, and the design of any given 
process is determined by the type of feedstock available. A wide range of differ-
ent catalyst compositions, shapes and sizes is now available to make operation 
more reliable and economic. The selection of the best choice of catalysts for a 
given process is made more complicated by the fact that several major  suppliers

deal with relatively large amounts of sulfur. The sulfur was removed in 
very large oxide boxes which contained bog iron ore. Small, low-pressure 
ammonia plants built before the introduction of the single-stream pro-
cesses often used activated carbon absorbents to remove the small 
amounts of impurities present in natural gas. Modern plants use co-
balt/molybdenum hydrodesulfurisation catalysts to convert organo-sulfur 
compounds to hydrogen sulfide prior to absorption by zinc oxide.  
• Reforming. Hydrocarbons are converted catalytically to a mixture of hy-
drogen, nitrogen and oxides of carbon in two separate stages, namely 
primary and secondary reforming. 
• Oxygenate removal. Carbon monoxide is converted catalytically to hy-
drogen and carbon dioxide in two separate stages, the high- and low-
temperature shift reactions. Carbon dioxide is removed by any of the 
available proprietary processes, and traces of residual carbon monoxide 
are converted to methane over a nickel methanation catalyst. Any water 
formed in this stage can be removed by molecular sieves, or by washing 
with product ammonia. 
• Ammonia Synthesis. This gives few problems in modern plants because 
the synthesis gas is extremely pure. Although the iron synthesis catalyst 
has not changed significantly since it was first used by BASF, a variety of 
different converters, using pre-reduced catalyst, now make the process 
more economic. A new, more active, catalyst made by impregnating an 
active carbon support with ruthenium has been developed. 
9.3 FEEDSTOCK PURIFICATION 
Hydrocarbons that can be fed to ammonia plants include natural gas, associated 
gas, liquid petroleum gas, and naphthas boiling up to 220°C. Higher hydrocar-
bons are not used in primary steam reforming because it would lead to coke 
formation on the catalysts. Hydrocarbons are usually contaminated with variable 
quantities of different sulfur compounds and often contain chlorides. These cata-
lyst poisons must be removed before the other catalysts in the plant can operate 
in a satisfactory manner. 
Impurities in natural gas are usually simple sulfur compounds such as hy-
drogen sulfide and mercaptans and are easily removed. Where the gas supply is 
also used for domestic purposes a stenching agent such as a thioether or thio-
phene may have been added. These less-reactive compounds have to be subject-
ed to a hydrogenolysis treatment before they can be removed. Naphthas contain 
several hundred parts per million of more complex organic sulfur compounds 
and may be pre-treated in a hydrofiner before use in ammonia or hydrogen pro-
duction. Variation in the sulfur content of feed does not affect the performance 
358 
 Chapter 9 
 
of the hydrodesulfurization catalysts and absorbents although larger volumes of 
absorbent must be included in the plant design to achieve a convenient operating 
cycle before replacement. 
 
9.3.1 Activated Carbon 
 
High-surface area, activated carbon has an affinity for some organo-sulfur com-
pounds and can be used as an absorbent for sulfur in chemical processes. For 
example, some of the early, low pressure ammonia plants operating in North 
America used two parallel beds of activated carbon to adsorb any sulfur impuri-
ties from natural gas. One bed operated while the second bed was being regener-
ated with steam to allow continuous ammonia production. However, mercaptans 
and carbonyl sulfide are not strongly bound to activated carbon and can be dis-
placed by higher molecular weight hydrocarbons in the gas stream. To improve 
adsorption efficiency the carbon was impregnated with iron or copper oxides 
which combined with sulfur but could be easily regenerated. Even so, sulfur 
retention was not reliable enough for the activated carbons to be used in modern 
high-pressure ammonia plants. The high cost of regular regeneration, plus sulfur 
poisoning of downstream catalysts, was excessive, as was the need to replace 
downstream catalysts poisoned by sulfur, and carbon was soon replaced by beds 
of more reliable zinc oxide. Zinc oxide beds were well established after having 
been used in hundreds of town gas, ammonia and hydrogen plants based on the 
naphtha steam reforming process. Since it replaced activated carbon zinc oxide 
has been almost exclusively used to protect steam reforming units. 
 
9.3.2 Hydrodesulfurization 
 
Zinc oxide can absorb simple sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and 
mercaptans to form zinc sulfide with mercaptans however some carbon may also 
be deposited. Other organic-sulfur compounds are not absorbed completely, and 
thermal cracking of these compounds results in the deposition of carbon onto the 
zinc oxide, thus reducing its absorption capacity. For these reasons, particularly 
when refractory organic sulfur compounds such as thiophene or thioethers are 
present in the feed, it is usual to add hydrogen and to include a bed of cobalt 
molybdate catalyst to hydrogenolyse the sulfur compounds to hydrogen sulfide, 
which can then be absorbed in the bed of zinc oxide. The cobalt/molybdate 
component is sulfided during commissioning to the active form and then oper-
ates in the same way as in refinery hydrotreating. Although cobalt/molybdate 
catalyst is the usual choice, nickel molybdate can also be used. This is important 
when the hydrogen stream contains a high proportion of carbon oxides. Unsul-
fided cobalt/molybdate can catalyse the methanation of carbon oxides at temper-
atures higher than about 300°C, and this may lead to excessive bed temperature 
while commissioning a new catalyst charge. This is less likely with the nickel 
 
Synthesis Gas 
  
359
catalyst. With liquid feeds, the catalyst can be presulfided at an appropriate low 
temperature. 
It is not usually necessary, however, to presulfide cobalt molybdate cata-
lysts before treating natural gas. Natural gas contains relatively small amounts of 
simple sulfur compounds that are hydrogenolyzed at a low temperature. Cata-
lysts are sulfided during operation during operation and the eventual sulfur con-
tent of the catalyst depends on the sulfur content of the natural gas. Catalyst will 
normally operate for several years with no loss of activity. The sulfur content of 
typical feeds is shown in Table 9.4. 
At the end of life in a typical ammonia plant, the cobalt/molybdate catalyst 
will contain 0.5–3.0wt% sulfur and 2-10wt% carbon. The carbon content may 
sometimes be higher than this but has no significant effect on performance. Hy-
drodesulfurization catalysts are usually pyrophoric after use because of adsorbed 
hydrogen and carbon deposits. Before catalysts are discharged the reactor must, 
therefore, be flushed with an inert gas such as nitrogen until the catalyst temper-
ature has fallen to less than 30°C. Large quantities of dust or carbon deposits on 
the top of the catalyst layer can be sucked off and any broken or contaminated 
pellets replaced with fresh catalyst. If the catalyst bed is to be completely re-
moved then a small volume of air can be added to the circulating nitrogen as the 
catalyst cools. Adsorbed hydrogen or hydrocarbons are oxidized. This will lead 
to a temperature increase and this can be controlled by limiting the volume of air 
added. The catalyst can then be discharged at ambient temperature after cooling.

9.3.3 Chlorine Removal  
 
The presence of chlorides in the feed gas can cause the zinc oxide to sinter as 
they are absorbed to form zinc chloride. Any hydrogen chloride formed in the 
hydrodesulfurizer can be removed from the gas by installing a bed of alkalized 
alumina in front of the zinc oxide. After this treatment the natural gas usually 
contains less than 0.1mg chlorine per cubic meter. An average of about 10–12 
wt% chloride can be absorbed before the alkalized alumina is saturated. Plat-
former hydrogen containing up to 2 ppm HCl is commonly treated in this way. 
Only a relatively small bed of absorbent is required at a space velocity of 
10,000–15,000 h-1. 
 
9.3.4 Sulfur Absorption 
 
Zinc oxide has been used to remove sulfur compounds from hydrocarbons since 
the 1930s, when the steam reforming process was first introduced. When a zinc 
oxide composition is specially prepared to have a high surface area and high 
degree of porosity, it can absorb more than 20 wt% sulfur in a single bed. It was 
the preferred choice in the early days, because the partial pressure of hydrogen 
sulfide at equilibrium under reaction conditions, particularly in the presence of 
water vapour, is very small compared to that of the bog iron ore used previously 
to purify water gas/producer gas. 
This observation was confirmed during the 1960s when luxmasse, a cheap 
form of iron oxide, was investigated as an absorbent to desulfurize naphtha feed 
in the British Gas Council Catalytic Rich Gas (CRG) process. Under typical 
operating conditions of 370-400ºC and with a vapour phase water concentration 
of 0.2–0.3%, the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the vapour at equilibrium 
is less than 3x10-3 ppm when using zinc oxide, compared with 0.2–0.3 ppm 
when using luxmasse. The data presented in Table 9.5 shows an increasing dif-
ferential as the concentration of water vapour increases. A further disadvantage 
of luxmasse is that it is also reduced to magnetite before conversion to iron sul-
fide by reaction with hydrogen sulfide. Thus more water vapour is produced by 
the conversion of luxmasse to iron sulfide, than is the case in the conversion of 
zinc oxide to zinc sulfide:

Thus six atoms of iron will produce nine molecules of water compared with six 
atoms of zinc, which only produce six. Furthermore iron sulfide can release hy-
drogen sulfide by reaction with hydrogen and steam during plant start-up or 
shut-down conditions. In practice, therefore, when iron oxide is used it is always 
followed by a guard bed of zinc oxide. 
 
9.3.4.1 Operation with Zinc Oxide 
 
In general, more sulfur is absorbed by zinc oxide at higher operating tempera-
tures, and when the porosity of the zinc oxide is increased. Consequently, oper-
ating temperatures are usually greater than 300ºC, and porous particles are pre-
ferred. However, the techniques needed to produce porous zinc oxide also lead 
to a decrease in particle strength, which results in fracture of the particles during 
loading and service, which, in turn leads to an increase in pressure drop across 
the bed. Furthermore, there is also a decrease in the bulk density of the bed, 
meaning that a lower mass of zinc oxide is charged to the reactor, and thus the 
maximum amount of sulfur that can be absorbed by the bed also decreases pro-
portionally. This means that it is possible for a fixed bed size of highly porous 
zinc oxide to absorb less sulfur than an equivalent bed of less porous, but more 
densely packed zinc oxide. The porosity of granules must therefore be optimized 
to give maximum absorbing efficiency and particle strength in any application 
within the temperature range from ambient to 400°C. Typical operating condi-
tions are given in Table 9.6. 
Up to about 10 ppm of low molecular weight mercaptans can be removed 
from natural gas without hydrogen addition, provided that the reaction tempera-

By increasing the porosity of the absorbent the sulfur absorption can be increased by 200% in the 
range ambient to 100°C and almost 100% at 200°C. 
 
 
ture is high enough to crack the sulfur compound. Carbon deposition does not 
immediately affect the sulfur absorption and a reasonable life can be achieved. 
For a longer life, or with increasing concentrations of organic sulfur compounds, 
a few percent of hydrogen is added to the gas stream being treated. This is rou-
tinely done in steam reforming plants which also nowadays include a bed of 
cobalt molybdate catalyst. Hydrogen addition, in this case, is also beneficial 
because it helps to reduce the reforming catalyst at the top of the steam reformer 
tubes. 
Carbonyl sulfide may be formed during natural gas treatment by the reac-
tion of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and this can be difficult to remove 
completely using zinc oxide alone. This is not a problem if a bed of cobalt mo-
lybdate catalyst is included in the desulfurizer. It has been shown that lead oxide 
is an efficient absorbent of carbonyl sulfide so the natural lead oxide impurity in 
some zinc oxides may promote absorption, especially if traces of water vapour 
are present to hydrolyze the carbonyl sulfide. 
The operating temperature and space velocity through the beds of cobalt 
molybdate and zinc oxide are chosen to give optimum performance for the sys-
tem as a whole. The maximum inlet temperature to the bed containing the co-
balt/molybdate is usually about 400ºC and the volume of zinc oxide is calculated 
to give an acceptable period of time on line prior to discharge, for a hydrocarbon 
feed with given sulfur content. This usually results in a space velocity of about 
500-1000 hr-1 in both beds and an operating life for the zinc oxide of at least one 
year. 
It can be more economical to have two beds of zinc oxide in series, with a 
by-pass line, so that one bed can be changed with the other still operating. This 
procedure allows an average of 25–30wt% sulfur pick-up during the period of 
operation. With one bed the average pick-up will probably be about 20%. Zinc 
oxide can desulfurize hydrocarbons at ambient temperature although the total 
sulfur pick-up will only be about 5% before saturation.

9.3.4.2 Preparation of Zinc Oxide 
 
Zinc oxide absorbents are supplied in a variety of shapes such as spheres, extru-
dates, or pellets. These are generally made by granulation or extrusion of the 
zinc oxide with small amounts of a suitable binding agent such as a cement. The 
final zinc oxide content ranges from 90-100% and the bulk density from about 
0.9–1.5 kg liter-1. High density catalysts do not necessarily have the largest ca-
pacity for sulfur because the pore volume can also be low and this limits absorp-
tion. An optimum balance between bulk density and pore volume is, therefore, 
essential to ensure that the maximum amount of the zinc oxide in a particle is 
fully used. This not only extends the useful operating life but also minimizes 
operating costs. The importance of proprietary catalyst recipes and raw materi-
als to improve catalyst performance have been explained in Chapter 1. Typical 
compositions are given in Table 9.7. 
 
9.3.4.3 Desulfurization of Other Gases 
 
Carbon dioxide may be desulfurized with zinc oxide at the same operating con-
ditions as for hydrocarbons. Below about 150°C, however, zinc carbonate is also 
formed at temperatures below about 150°C but this is subsequently converted to 
zinc sulfide until saturation is reached. 
9.4 STEAM REFORMING 
Hydrocarbons are converted into a mixture of hydrogen and oxides of carbon by 
reaction with steam over steam reforming catalysts. The reforming reaction is 
endothermic and the catalysts are packed into narrow tubes, which are heated in 
a furnace. The reforming furnace is commonly known as a reformer. An effi-
cient methane steam reforming process was developed by 19366,7 and was first 
used on a large scale in North America during World War Two as shown in Ta-

ble 9.8. Early reformers operated at slightly higher than atmospheric pressure. 
As demand for fertilizer nitrogen increased, however, and better alloys for re-
former tubes were developed higher reforming pressures could be used in larger 
ammonia plants. 
The original raschig ring catalyst, which contained precipitated nickel ox-
ide, kaolin and a silica cement, was more or less unchanged until high-pressure 
reformers were introduced. Some of the early catalyst charges to be used lasted 
for about 20 years.11 Eventually, improved catalysts were required in modern 
plants because silica was found to be volatile in high-pressure steam and the 
catalyst rings part way down the tubes became weakened. At first, silica free 
catalysts were made by exactly the same procedure, simply excluding silica 
from the ingredients and using alumina cements. However, all modern, high 
activity, reforming catalysts are now based on preformed, thermally stable, sili-
ca-free supports impregnated with nickel oxide. Ring catalysts are still available 
but the same formulation can be provided as special, high geometric surface area 
shapes. Shapes require pressure drop through the tubes and are able to transfer 
heat rapidly from the tube wall to the reacting gases. As a result of better heat 
transfer and higher activity, lower gas temperatures are effective in the tubes and 
the furnace. 
Until 1960, steam reformers were only used in areas with readily available 
supplies of natural gas. As the cost of handling large quantities of coal increased 
during the 1950s and large volumes of cheap naphtha became available from 
refineries, the range of feedstock that could be reformed was extended by the 
introduction of a new alkalized reforming catalyst based on nickel. This began a 
revolution in synthesis gas production throughout the world. This new catalyst 
enabled the use of cheap naphtha with a boiling point up to 220C to be used, 
without the deposition of carbon on the catalyst and furthermore, there were no 
compression costs in the operation of the reformers at higher pressures. The de-

would deform or creep at the high operating temperatures required for the steam 
reforming process. The lifetime of the reactor tubes before failure was the main 
limitation to progress, until more thermally resistant alloys became available. 
When designing a reformer the effects of stress at the high operating tempera-
ture and pressure are taken into account to select the most economic tube mate-
rial for a life of about 100,000 hours. 
For effective operation, heat must be transferred rapidly from the furnace it-
self to the surface of the catalyst, particularly at the top of the tubes. This is to 
ensure that the hydrocarbon feed reacts rapidly with the steam, as this helps to 
avoid the cracking reactions that lead to deactivation of the catalyst, and which 
in turn, helps to avoid overheating of the reactor tubes. This is achieved by the 
production of a catalyst with a high stable activity and by shaping the catalyst in 
such a way that allows rapid mixing of the gases in the tube, to allow effective 
heat transfer from the wall of the tube to the catalyst. This also results in a uni-
form temperature gradient throughout the tube. Careful packing of the catalyst 
rings or shapes into the narrow, 3-4 inch diameter tubes is necessary to equalize 
the gas flow and pressure drop through each tube. This also helps to avoid cata-
lyst breakage and voids within the catalyst bed. Any of these problems can lead 
to maldistribution of gas flow, which causes variable tube temperatures and hot 
spots. 
Reformers built during the l940s, which operated at up to 50 psig, consisted 
of about 66 tubes made of rolled and welded tubes made from type 310 stainless 
steel. The early, high-pressure reformers built during 1965–1970 operated at up 
to 500psig and contained up to 400 cast tubes made from HK40. Eventually, 
when even better alloys like Manaurite 36X were introduced the HK40 tubes 
were also replaced. Reforming capacity could be increased by up to 10–15% at 
the same heat flux but with a lower wall temperature by putting a larger volume 
of catalyst into Mauranite tubes of the same diameter as usual, but with thinner 
walls. This was particularly useful when better catalysts, giving a lower pressure 
drop and even better heat transfer, became available. 
The hydrocarbon reforming reaction gives a mixture of carbon monoxide 
and water which is close to equilibrium at the usual operating conditions. The 
reaction between steam and the hydrocarbon gives a mixture of carbon monox-
ide and hydrogen that is close to thermodynamic equilibrium at the temperature 
and pressure of the reactor. 
 
 
  
 
CH4  +  H2O  ↔  CO  +  3 H2 
(9.8) 
 
The operating steam to hydrocarbon ratio, or steam ratio, must, however, be 
higher than the stoichiometric level to avoid carbon formation on the catalyst, by 
cracking reactions, and to provide enough steam to operate the water gas shift 
reaction later in the process. 
368 
 Chapter 9 
 
 The presence of excess steam in the process gas to the reformer results in 
the formation of carbon dioxide by the water gas shift reaction. Thus the gas 
leaving the steam reformer also contains between 7 and 15% carbon dioxide: 
 
 
  
 
CO  +  H2O  ↔  CO2  +  H2 
(9.9) 
 
Typical operating conditions for a modern steam reformer are given in Ta-
ble 9.9 although these can be slightly different depending on the overall plant 
design. The table also includes typical conditions for the steam reformers in 
methanol and hydrogen plants which use the same catalysts. These examples 
illustrate the wide variations in gas composition which can be achieved by 
changing the operating steam ratio, temperature and pressure, to increase me-
thane conversion. 
The long catalyst tubes are suspended vertically in rows within the furnace 
(Figure 9.3). The hydrocarbon/steam mixture, preheated to about 500°C, passes 
into the reformer through a header pipe connected to the tops of each tube by 
pigtails or flexible joints. Following reaction, the products leave the reformer 
via a manifold pipe to the secondary reformer. Heat can be supplied to the fur-
nace from burners at the top, sides or bottom of the insulated box. The intensity 
of the heat, or heat flux, in the furnace can be varied depending on the demands 
of the reaction but is generally highest at about one third from the top of the 
tube, where most of the endothermic reaction takes place. 
Furnace design is complex and is fully described in specialized publica-
tions.12 Catalyst operation at extremely high temperatures is critical in the pro-
duction of ammonia and full instructions on handling and operation are issued 
by all catalyst suppliers.

Early catalysts were slowly developed to improve resistance to carbon formation. 
A Operated well with pure methane but when poisoned by sulfur and unsaturated hydrocarbons led 
to carbon deposition. 
B Ciment fondu acted as a filler and partly inhibited carbon formation. 
C Gave activity as high as A and less carbon than B but still sensitive to unsaturated hydrocarbons. 
D Could be used with most natural gases and off gas, providing that poisons were removed. Some 
early charges operated for 10–20 years with occasional steaming to clean catalyst. 
 
 
The early catalyst formulations, with only minor changes, were still being 
used until about 1965 when methane was first reformed at pressures above about 
15atm. Silica is volatile in steam at the reforming temperature in high-pressure 
plants and it is then deposited at a lower temperature in the waste heat boilers, or 
on to the high-temperature shift catalyst. This led to the development of silica-
free reforming catalysts made from alumina, rather than kaolin or magnesia, and 
alumina cement, rather than ciment fondu. Although alumina based catalysts 
were active, it was found that they lost strength at high temperature. This led to 
some breakage and caused hot or patchy tubes. Attempts were made to improve 
strength by incorporating titanium dioxide into the catalyst recipe rather than 
alumina although these were not really successful. The best solution was found 
to be the use of silica free preformed rings, impregnated with nickel nitrate, 
which could be decomposed to give nickel oxide. Problems in the early days in 
the selection of a support that was stable in the severe operating conditions led 
to the introduction of several different catalysts. The supports ranged from pure 
alpha alumina to calcium aluminate and magnesium aluminate. Operational 
problems were experienced in the early days, arising from poor thermal stability 
and loss of activity when using α–alumina supports. Carbon was deposited about 
one third of the way down from the top of the tube and hot bands formed in 
high-heat-flux converters. 
A partial solution to the low activity problem was to use shorter rings to 
improve heat transfer although this did, of course, this did increase the pressure 
drop through the tubes. Hot bands could also be avoided by using alkalized cata-
lysts in the top part of tubes to control carbon deposition. It was clear that im-
proved reforming catalysts were required, not only with a higher, stable activity 
but also, as it turned out, with a different shape. 
By the time most ammonia plants were being operated beyond the limits of 
their design capacity, new catalyst shapes were eventually developed. The origi-

nal intention was to increase the geometric surface area of the ring and thus to 
increase activity. A further benefit was, however, found to be a reduction of the 
pressure drop through the tubes and improved heat transfer from the tube wall to 
the reacting gases. Once again a variety of different shapes were introduced 
ranging from rings, spoked wagon wheels and cylinders with either four or sev-
en holes. Part of the range of catalyst compositions and shapes available is 
shown in Table 9.11. 
 
9.4.3. Reformer Operation 
 
The catalyst should be loaded carefully into the reformer tubes to avoid 
breaking the rings. The normal procedure is to fill socks or soft tubes with a 
bottom flap which can be lowered into each of the tubes before use. The sock is 
then withdrawn from the tube and the flap opens to leave the catalyst in place. 
To ensure even packing, the same weight of catalyst is placed in each tube and 
the pressure drop measured. Gentle tapping, at the bottom of the tubes, may be 
needed to pack the catalyst properly. In common with all other tubular reactors 
charging catalyst into the tubes of a steam reformer is a laborious process. 
The catalyst must be activated by reduction with a hydrogen-rich gas added 
to the steam passing through the tubes. A steam to hydrogen ratio of about six is 
used during reduction at operating temperature. The procedure can be completed 
in about six to eight hours. Feed may then be gradually introduced and operation 
begins. Catalyst breakage can result from shortage of steam or thermal shock 
during  operation.  This leads to an uneven gas flow with hot tubes and  possible

carbon deposition. In badly affected tubes the catalyst must be replaced. The 
leakage of sulfur or chlorine from the purification stage also results in poisoning 
and deactivation of the catalyst. Any decrease in activity leads to a high methane 
content in the reformed gas from the reformer tubes which results in hot spots in 
the tube and the deposition of more carbon. A mild occurrence of sulfur or chlo-
rine poisoning can generally be reversed by increasing the steam ratio for a short 
period. Arsenic is a permanent poison to the catalyst. If the arsenic concentration 
in the catalyst at the top of the tubes exceeds about 150 ppm, then the catalyst 
must be changed, and the tubes cleaned very carefully. The arsenic usually 
found its way into the reformers in the early days either as a component of the 
feedstock, or through some maloperation of the Vetrocoke system, used for the 
absorption of carbon dioxide. A typical early warning of catalyst poisoning is a 
gradual increase in the methane content of gas leaving the reformer and, in seri-
ous cases, an increase in pressure drop. 
The introduction of the first 1000 tons per day high-pressure steam reform-
ers in single stream plants led to some operating difficulties. For example, the 
new high heat flux reformers developed overheated bands, about one third of the 
way down the reformer tubes. Hot bands, as they were called, resulted from the 
deposition of carbon from the thermal cracking reaction as the catalyst lost ac-
tivity. Carbon can most easily form from methane cracking: 
 
 
  
CH4  ↔  C  +  2 H2 
(9.10) 
 
This normally takes place when flow of steam stops for any reason but is also 
thermodynamically possible during full-scale operation of a reformer before the 
gas temperature reaches about 650°C. 
Fortunately, two other reactions lead to the removal of carbon under normal 
reforming conditions: 
 
 
  
C  +  CO2  ↔  2 CO 
Boudouard reaction 
(9.11) 
 
 
  
C  +  H2O  ↔  CO  +  H2 
Water-gas reaction 
(9.12) 
 
Thus, any carbon formation arising from the cracking reaction at the tube inlet is 
controlled to some extent by the two carbon removal reactions, which tend to be 
rather faster than the cracking reaction. Unfortunately, the cracking reaction 
becomes the faster reaction at temperatures above about 650ºC and this tempera-
ture corresponds to the position in the reactor tube where the hot bands tend to 
form. The rate of carbon deposition is greater than its rate of removal, unless the 
activity of the catalyst is sufficient to provide sufficient hydrogen by the reform-
ing reaction to prevent the deposition of carbon in the first place. 
It was clear that a more active and thermally stable catalyst was needed. For 
some time the situation was controlled by the use of shorter rings at the top of 
 
Synthesis Gas

the tube. This provided more geometric surface area and increased reforming 
activity. Even more successful operation was possible if the shorter rings were 
alkalized. The addition of potash to catalysts under development for the reform-
ing of naphtha was introduced by ICI during the 1960s and was a major factor in 
the control of the formation of hot bands. The potash had the effect of accelerat-
ing the steam carbon reaction and inhibiting cracking and polymerization on the 
catalyst surface. 
During the 1970s and 1980s the cost of oil had increased substantially and 
production of ammonia in the older plants was becoming uneconomical. This 
led to the revamping of many units and the use of more energy efficient process-
es. A steam reformer uses about one third of the total energy required by a large 
ammonia plant. It was therefore suggested that the steam ratio could be de-
creased, from 3.5–4.0 to less than 3.0, even though this could mean that more 
carbon would deposit on the catalyst and that higher tube wall temperature 
would lead to shorter tube life. A penalty of operating a reformer with hot tubes, 
for any reason, is that a temperature only 10°C above the design level can re-
duce the tube life by up to 50%. The cost of tube failures resulting from the use 
of low activity catalysts or decreasing the steam ratio was very high. 
The new catalyst shapes that were under development gave some compen-
sation for these disadvantages. Higher activity, particularly at lower temperature, 
could help to avoid carbon formation. Carefully optimized shapes also gave a 
lower pressure drop and provided better heat transfer within the tubes to de-
crease the temperature of the tube wall. The use of manaurite tubes also helped 
to improve operation. 
Some operators decided to use a small pre-reformer able to ease the load on 
the primary reformer and to give further energy savings. The small adiabatic 
reactor was loaded with a stable high activity catalyst operating at 530°C. The 
alkalized nickel alumina catalyst, introduced by British Gas in their CRG Pro-
cess during the 1960s, can operate continuously for about two years. All traces 
of high hydrocarbons were removed in the prereformer and methane was partial-
ly reformed to give about 20% hydrogen in the feed gas entering the primary 
reformer. This allowed the minimum practicable steam ratio to be used. 
An overall fuel saving of 7–10% was possible, and the tube wall tempera-
ture of the reformer tubes can be reduced by about 20°C by decreasing the firing 
rate and heat flux in the reformer. This leads to a longer tube life. Alternatively, 
up to 5–10% extra ammonia could be produced by increasing the feed rate. 
When mixed feeds were used, as in some hydrogen plants, steadier operation 
was possible. Brief details of the CRG pre-reforming process operation are giv-
en in Table 9.12.

9.4.4. Secondary Reforming 
 
When coke was the basic raw material for the production of ammonia synthesis 
gas, the hydrogen and nitrogen required was supplied by mixing water gas and 
producer gas. Several small ammonia plants were, in complete contrast, built in 
the United States during the 1920s to use electrolytic hydrogen.8 The operators 
found it relatively easy to introduce the necessary nitrogen by burning some of 
the hydrogen in air. When the war time methane steam reformers were built by 
the US Government, the same procedure was modified by burning primary re-
former outlet gas in a high temperature adiabatic reactor containing more prima-
ry reforming catalyst. The additional reactor became known as the secondary 
reformer. Eventually a catalyst with lower nickel content, and an even higher 
thermal stability, was developed to withstand the very high temperature reached 
at the top of the bed. 
In modern ammonia plants, air containing the design volume of nitrogen 
needed for ammonia synthesis is added to the secondary reformer. Two im-
portant reactions can take place over the heat-resistant nickel catalyst. Two im-
portant reactions take place over the heat resistant nickel catalyst in the second-
ary reformer. Firstly, the oxygen component of the air is consumed by combus-
tion with hydrogen and possibly carbon monoxide. Secondly, some of the resid-
ual methane from the primary reformer undergoes further reforming. Both reac-
tions reach equilibrium at a bed outlet temperature of about 1000°C. The me-
thane content of gas leaving the secondary reformer is usually in the range 0.2–
0.5% while oxygen is completely removed. 
The main problems in the operation of a secondary reformer are associated 
with the high temperatures generated by the combustion reactions. The gas dis-
tributor must be well designed so that the process gas and air are mixed as rapid-
ly and thoroughly as possible. The catalyst bed itself is protected from the very 
high temperatures generated by the homogeneous combustion of air, by a layer 
of refractory material that is placed on top of the large, temperature-resistant 
catalyst particles. The rest of the bed is filled with secondary reforming catalyst.

The catalyst can operate for several years provided that the reacting gases 
are well mixed and that no hot spots (which in extreme cases could reach 
15000C) are allowed to develop in the catalyst bed. The gas distributor plays an 
important part in protecting the catalyst. The temperature of the catalyst bed in 
the secondary reformer falls as gas passes through the bed. At the inlet to the 
bed, the temperature is extremely high due to the highly exothermic combustion 
reaction in which all of the oxygen is consumed. The temperature of the bed 
towards the outlet then falls as the endothermic reforming reaction takes place. 
It is interesting to note that when the temperature of the primary reformer outlet 
falls and the slippage of methane increases, the temperature of the outlet of the 
secondary reformer also falls. Typical operating conditions are shown in Table 
9.13. 
Secondary reforming catalyst contains about 7% nickel oxide, supported on 
temperature-resistant α–alumina or calcium aluminate, in the form of raschig 
rings. Additional catalyst used at the top of the bed as a heat guard is in the form 
of large solid cylinders of α-alumina containing 5% nickel oxide. 
9.5. CARBON MONOXIDE REMOVAL 
Carbon monoxide leaving the secondary reformer is converted to useful hydro-
gen by the water gas shift reaction in a two-stage recovery section. The original 
high temperature shift reactor is now combined with a low temperature reactor 
filled with a copper catalyst. The removal of carbon monoxide is shown in Fig-
ure 9.4. Since copper catalysts are extremely prone to poisoning by sulfur and 
chlorine compounds, it is therefore essential that the concentration of these con-
taminants is reduced to an absolute minimum.

if the catalyst has been manufactured from ferrous sulfate. When commissioning 
such a catalyst, most of the sulfur is reduced to hydrogen sulfide by the process 
gas and this amount would be sufficient to destroy the LTS catalyst if it were 
allowed to pass into the catalyst bed. It is normal practise, therefore, to flare the 
gas product until it is free from sulfur, before allowing the low temperature shift 
to come on line.  
The forward shift reaction that is the conversion of carbon monoxide into 
hydrogen and carbon dioxide is quite strongly exothermic, and in common with 
all exothermic reactions, the level of conversion of carbon monoxide to products 
at equilibrium is greater at lower temperatures. The equilibrium constant is in-
dependent of pressure, but higher conversions are also obtained at higher steam 
ratios. Unfortunately, the preferred iron catalyst is not active at low temperature 
and plants operate in the temperature range 350° - 500°C. Furthermore, the more 
active catalysts based on copper that are active at low temperatures are not suffi-
ciently stable to be able to withstand the exotherm associated with the shift reac-
tion when the feed gas contains high levels of carbon monoxide. The exact con-
ditions for operation of the high temperature shift converter are therefore deter-
mined by the carbon monoxide content of the gas entering the reactor, and the 
steam ratio used in the primary reformer. 
At the time when natural gas was introduced as feed to a steam reformer 
from about 1940 onwards, most ammonia plants were designed to use single 
beds of HTS catalyst and the concentration of carbon monoxide in the outlet gas 
was about 2%. The synthesis gas from the older plants, which used coal as feed-
stock, contained higher concentrations of carbon monoxide, and it was often 
necessary to control the temperature by splitting the reactor into two or more 
separate beds, with inter-bed cooling or by the incorporation of a quench system. 
More recently, when the first ammonia plants based on natural gas were first 
operated at the higher pressures, a two bed/inter-cooled reactor design was also 
used and the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exit gas was lowered to 
about 1% It was then practicable to use a methanator to hydrogenate the residual 
carbon monoxide to methane, rather than operating with the copper liquor 
scrubbing stage which had previously been used for the final removal of carbon 
monoxide. 
 
9.5.2 High Temperature Conversion Catalysts 
 
The first HTS catalysts were reported to operate for about two years before re-
placement was required. As production techniques were developed, however, 
catalyst lives improved so that by 1940, lives of more than 14 years were regu-
larly achieved. There were few poisons which affected the catalyst performance 
although sulfur, which was the most common impurity in early plants, did sul-
fide the magnetite. This reaction was, nevertheless, reversible. If hydrogen sul-
fide levels exceeded about 300 ppm, sulfided catalysts could not be regenerated 
378 
 Chapter 9 
 
and about twice the normal volume of catalyst had to be used to compensate for 
the lower activity of iron sulfide. 
The catalysts were originally produced from readily available materials 
such as copperas, the ferrous sulfate waste product from steel works, and 
chrome tan, an industrial form of chromic acid. The process involved precipita-
tion from ferrous sulfate solution with sodium carbonate. The precipitate was 
carefully washed, to remove soluble impurities but early catalysts still contained 
up to 1-2% insoluble ferric and chromic hydroxyl sulfates, which formed hydro-
gen sulfide during catalyst reduction. It was possible for the concentration of 
hydrogen sulfide in the process gas to reach more than 250 ppm, gradually fall-
ing over a period of several days, before the concentration fell to a an equilibri-
um level. Of course, on most occasions hydrogen sulfide levels were lower than 
this. When catalysts were used in naphtha based town gas plants during the 
1960s and, later, in single stream ammonia plants with copper based LTS cata-
lyst, the HTS catalyst production method had to be modified. With low sulfur 
catalysts it was possible to produce sulfur free gas following reduction in less 
than twelve hours. 
A further undesirable feature of catalysts containing chromium is that dur-
ing the calcination stage of preparation, a proportion of the chromium oxide is 
oxidized to hexavalent chromium at temperatures in the range 250°–350°C. The 
concentration of hexavalent chromium falls to an acceptable level of less than 
1% when the calcination temperature is increased to about 430°C. High levels of 
hexavalent chromium in the catalyst lead to a significant exotherm during reduc-
tion, which can lower the activity of the catalyst. Furthermore, handling of the 
catalyst during manufacture can be a very dusty procedure, and contact with the 
dust containing hexavalent chromium is hazardous to the workforce, since it 
believed to have carcinogenic properties. 
 
9.5.2.1 Operating Conditions 
 
In modern, single stream ammonia plants there is little scope in the design to 
make significant changes to the operating conditions in any of the individual 
catalyst reactors. Operating conditions for the carbon monoxide conversion reac-
tion are shown in Table 9.14. The only practical variable is operating tempera-
ture which can be slowly increased as catalyst loses activity. 
The composition of the catalyst can affect its performance in many ways. 
For example, changes in the formulation to lower the amount of hydrogen sul-
fide evolved during reduction led to a significant physical weakening of the 
catalyst, which became much more prone to damage caused by the condensation 
of water or contamination by potash. Any water that condensed during plant 
start-up could also wash out any soluble chromium and lead to loss of stability. 
Most problems led to an increase in pressure drop or maldistribution of gas. Cat

alysts were usually, however, able to operate for a period ranging from two to 
four years. 
With the drive to more energy-efficient ammonia plants in the 1980s, the 
steam ratio fed to the primary reformer was significantly decreased. Apart from 
the effects in the reformer which have already been described, a number of 
changes were detected in the operation of the HTS catalyst. The lower steam 
ratio was still greater than the level calculated from the thermodynamics at 
which magnetite could be reduced to the metallic state (Figure 9.5). However, 
the lower concentration of steam resulted in a higher level of carbon monoxide 
in the process gas, as described earlier in this chapter, and this increase in the 
carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide ratio gave rise to a more reducing atmosphere. 
This, in turn, led to the formation of more carbon by the disproportionation of 
carbon monoxide, also known as the Boudouard reaction. The end result was an 
increase in pressure drop, and further disintegration of the catalyst. 
Carbon monoxide also reacted with magnetite forming carbides which cata-
lyzed the production of hydrocarbons by Fischer-Tropsch reactions. It has since 
been shown that both reactions can be suppressed by the addition of copper to 
the existing iron-chromium catalyst. This has allowed operation of HTS cata-
lysts in existing plants down to a steam ratio as low as 0.4 compared with about 
0.6 in the early single stream plants. 
In more recent ammonia plant designs, in which the large steam reforming 
furnace has been replaced with gas-heated reformers or combined autothermal 
reformers, the HTS catalyst can be replaced by a temperature resistant copper 
catalyst that can operate at temperature as low as 260°–270°C.

The additional methane formed must then be purged from the synthesis loop 
which leads to even more hydrogen loss as significant hydrogen is also removed 
during the purge. Overall, the equivalent of failing to convert just 0.1% of car-
bon monoxide is more than 4000 tons of ammonia every year, or about 1% of 
the design production. 
Every catalyst in an ammonia plant is important but, because low-
temperature carbon monoxide conversion catalyst is likely to be the most sensi-
tive to poisons, good operation of this catalyst is probably the most significant. 
Apart from using the best available catalyst, it is usual to make an allowance for 
catalyst poisoning by increasing the catalyst volume in the reactor.  
 
9.5.3.1 Operation 
 
An LTS catalyst should be sufficiently active to give a high conversion for a 
given volume of catalyst at the minimum practicable temperature. It should also 
be thermally stable and operate for the design period with maximum carbon 
monoxide conversion. With proper design and good upstream poisons removal, 
a typical catalyst lifetime is about three years. 
The catalyst must be activated by careful reduction to convert the copper 
oxide component to metallic copper before use (Figure 9.6). The reduction reac-
tion is exothermic and the reduction process must be carried out using an inert 
carrier gas to which a low concentration of hydrogen has been added, so that the 
temperature of the bed does not exceed 250ºC. After reduction and when a new 
charge of catalyst is commissioned, the bed should be heated to a temperature 
greater than the dew point of the feed gas so that liquid water does not condense 
onto the catalyst when the feed is first admitted. The temperature is then in-
creased gradually until the reaction begins. At this stage, the temperature can be 
adjusted until the required degree of conversion is achieved and a satisfactory 
temperature profile is seen in the bed. 
As the catalyst ages, the peak temperature moves slowly down the bed 
(Figure 9.7). The rate of movement depends both on the thermal stability of the 
catalyst and on the total amounts of different poisons that accumulate on the 
bed. The temperature at the inlet to the bed can be increased gradually to com-
pensate for deactivation of the catalyst. Eventually the catalyst must be changed 
because the concentration  of carbon  monoxide leaving the bed at equilibrium

9.5.3.2 Catalyst 
 
The first LTS catalysts were based on copper and zinc oxides, (CuO)/2ZnO), 
and were prepared by calcination of the precipitated hydroxycarbonates of zinc 
and copper. By 1965, it was found that incorporation of some alumina into the 
formulation led to an increase in thermal stability and improved resistance to 
poisons. Depending on the plant conditions, the operating life of the catalyst was 
increased from about six months to more than two years. The most successful 
catalysts were produced by simultaneous precipitation of the copper, zinc and 
aluminum hydroxycarbonates, at about pH = 7, to optimize the particle size and 
distribution of the oxides. They were similar in composition to the successful 
low-pressure methanol catalysts produced in the same way although the copper 
content was significantly lower. Other catalysts were introduced which had high 
copper content in an effort to achieve a high activity. High copper catalysts were 
more susceptible to poisoning in some plants. Another catalyst, based on copper 
and zinc oxides but with high chromium oxide content, was expected to be re-
generable, to be able to compensate for the effects of poisons. However, it was 
very susceptible to poisoning by sulfur, needed a long period off line for regen-
eration, and its use was not successful. This catalyst has now proved to be an 
acceptable chlorine guard for a much more stable copper-zinc-aluminum cata-
lyst. Details of approximate catalyst compositions are given in Table 9.15. 
Most spent catalysts contain varying amounts of sulfur, chlorine and silica 
poisons depending on the age of the catalyst and the purity of synthesis gas. The 
effects of each poison can therefore be considered separately in relation to the 
differing operating conditions. In some cases, up to 3–4% sulfur has been meas-

ured in samples from the top of catalyst beds when the life has been as long as 
seven years. The level of chloride in the same samples has been less than 0.02-
0.04%, and it can be concluded that sulfur is held firmly by the catalyst and may 
not be a serious problem. A possible explanation for this observation is that alt-
hough sulfur compounds are initially adsorbed by the copper crystallites, they 
are rapidly transferred to the small zinc oxide crystals. Zinc sulfide, which is 
thermodynamically more stable, is easily formed. This mechanism is dependent 
upon the manufacturing process to provide small crystallites in the catalyst 
structure. Similarly, silica deposits of up to 1.5wt% at the top of the LTS cata-
lyst bed have been detected after satisfactory lives of two to four years. 
On the other hand, while chlorides accumulate near the top of the catalyst, 
they are more mobile and can be detected in significant concentrations, up to 
0.05%, at all levels in a deactivated bed. Although reasonable lives of at least 
two years can often be achieved in the presence of chloride there is more rapid 
movement of the peak in temperature profile, and the concentration of carbon 
monoxide in the outlet gas increases more rapidly. Surface chlorides, which are 
formed by reaction with zinc oxide, are mobile and sinter the catalyst surface. 
Chlorides are also soluble in condensed steam and can be washed down onto 
lower, more active catalyst layers. 
Sulfur and chlorine are both present in the hydrocarbon feed, the process 
steam and the lubricating oils used while sulfur may also come from the high 
temperature shift catalyst. A major source of chlorine is from the air used in the 
secondary reformer. Silica is present in process steam but also comes from the 
refractory linings or support materials used in the reforming section. 
9.6 METHANATION 
Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide cause the temporary deactivation of am-
monia catalysts. Carbon dioxide can also lead to further problems because it 
forms ammonium carbonate in the make-up gas compressor and the synthesis 
loop. The removal of these impurities is, therefore, a vital step in the purification 
of synthesis gas. Removal of carbon dioxide has generally been via absorption 
in some suitable solvent, whereas at the present time, the concentration of car-
bon monoxide is reduced to a low level by reaction with steam in the water gas 
shift reaction, prior to almost complete removal by an additional procedure. 
Methanation, the conversion of carbon monoxide and dioxide to methane, 
was described by Sabatier in 1905, during his work on hydrogenation catalysts, 
and since then it has been used in several industrial processes. Since about 1955, 
as the use of large, single-stream\m ammonia plants became more widespread, 
the methanation reaction has become the preferred way to remove the final trac-
es of carbon oxides from the process gas.

verted. Although the catalyst should not normally be operated at temperatures 
exceeding 450°C it is frequently allowed to overheat to temperatures as high as 
600ºC during periods of maloperation, but seems to incur little deactivation.. 
There is probably more chance of damage to the reactor in these situations. At a 
space velocity in the range 5000-7000 hours-1 methanation is virtually complete 
at a space velocity in the range 5000-7000h-1 and the outlet carbon oxides level 
is usually less than 5ppm. Good methanation catalysts have a normal life of 
about ten years. 
The most common catalyst poisons are derived from traces of solvent car-
ried over from carbon dioxide removal process. These simply block the catalyst 
pores and, providing no sulfur or arsenic compounds are used, can easily be re-
moved by washing the catalyst with water to restore activity. If sulfur enters the 
catalyst bed from any other source it will rapidly poison the methanation cata-
lyst. The low temperature shift catalyst, up-stream of the methanator, usually 
acts as a very efficient sulfur guard! 
 
9.6.2. Catalyst 
 
Different suppliers have produced methanation catalyst in a wide range of 
shapes and sizes, ranging from spheres and pellets to extrusions and granules, 
containing between 15–30% nickel oxide. Some typical support materials react 
with nickel oxide to form relatively stable spinels, which cannot readily be re-
duced to give an active catalyst, and these materials are not used. It is better if 
the nickel oxide can be precipitated in solid solution with a thermally stable ma-
trix similar to those supports used in reforming catalysts. Typical supports are 
alumina, silica and magnesia, sometimes bound by alumina cement. The most 
important catalyst property is that it can be reduced easily at a temperature at or 
below 300°C to give an active and stable catalyst. The nickel can be combined 
with the support by either impregnation or precipitation, provided that the final 
catalyst is thermally stable. 
The nickel oxide component of the catalyst is reduced to the metal with 
process gas, by gradually increasing the temperature of the bed to about 300ºC. 
If necessary, the reduction procedure can be assisted by allowing a small propor-
tion of the process gas to bypass the low temperature shift converter. This results 
in a temporary increase in the concentration of the oxides of carbon in the reduc-
ing gas to around 1–2%, which are then hydrogenated into methane over the 
active part of the catalyst. The resulting exotherm from the reaction increases 
the temperature of the bed to about 400oC, so that any remaining nickel oxide 
can be reduced fully. During the reduction period the carbon monoxide and car-
bon dioxide content of outlet gas is analyzed at regular intervals. Full operation 
can start when the level falls to less than 20 ppm. This normally takes 10–15 
hours. If the LTS reactor cannot be by-passed the catalyst reduction should be 
388

completed, more slowly, at the highest inlet temperature possible up to a maxi-
mum of 450°C. 
 
9.6.3. Other Methanation Processes 
 
Methanation catalysts or, alternatively, pressure-swing absorption are used to 
purify synthesis gas and refinery hydrogen throughout the world. The methana-
tion reaction has also been applied in other interesting and useful processes alt-
hough not yet on a very significant scale. 
When natural gas was felt to be running short in the US the British Gas 
Council CRG (Catalytic Rich Gas) process was converted to produce a substi-
tute natural gas process simply by adding two methanation reactors to the origi-
nal town gas process. The rich gas, including steam, was cooled and then 
methanated at 300°C limiting the outlet temperature to less than 400°C. The gas 
was cooled again and the remaining oxides of carbon were converted to methane 
in a second reactor, with a rise in temperature of only about 40oC, as shown in 
Table 9.16. Unalkalized CRG catalysts were used in the methanation reactors. 
Other processes were introduced by Lurgi and Japan Gasoline but, in the end, 
there no need for additional supplies of natural gas and the plants were only op-
erated for a short time. It was also shown that the product from coal gasification, 
which contained oxides of carbon, was an alternative feed for conversion to me-
thane. 
Pure hydrogen can be recovered by a methanation procedure from olefin 
plant tail gas that contains methane, ethylene and carbon monoxide. Typical 
methanation catalysts will remove up to 0.3% carbon monoxide and 0.3% eth-
ylene at 270°C, 30 atm pressure and about 6000 h-1 space velocity. A catalyst 
which does not crack ethylene to form carbon but which can produce ethane or

methane by hydrogenation, should be chosen for the duty. Carbon monoxide is 
completely removed by this procedure. 
The EVA-ADAM process was proposed as a means whereby energy could 
be transferred over fairly long distance. The process was based on a combination 
of the steam reforming and methanation reactions. The energy required to fuel 
the endothermic steam reforming reaction could be obtained from any remote 
source, such as a nuclear reactor, in contrast to the normal process in which gas 
is burnt to supply the heat. The products from the steam reforming reaction con-
tained both hydrogen and the oxides of carbon. Energy, in the form of super-
heated steam, was then recovered from the exothermic heat of methanation at a 
second location. Methane was also available as fuel if necessary. The high tem-
perature of the operation in the methanators, at 700°C, 500°C and 300°C, inlet 
the three reactors, required that special active, yet heat resistant, catalysts were 
necessary. The catalysts were deactivated by a combination of sulfur poisoning 
and carbon formation, through partial regeneration was possible by treatment 
with hydrogen at 500°C. The reaction product contained about 80% methane. 
Adiabatic beds could be replaced by internally cooled, tubular reactors (IRMA). 
The maximum temperature in tubes reached more than 600°C. The process has 
an exit temperature of 320°C giving up to 83% methane. Once again, the pro-
cess has not yet been commercialized. 
9.7 OTHER APPLICATIONS OF STEAM REFORMING 
The steam reforming process with typical catalysts has been widely used to pro-
duce a range of hydrogen rich gases. The examples in Table 9.17 show how the 
operating conditions have been modified to obtain the appropriate gas composi-
tion. 
 
9.7.1 Methanol Synthesis Gas 
 
The gas produced by steam reforming any hydrocarbon using normal catalysts 
can be used directly as methanol synthesis gas with no further treatment. When 
methane is used as feedstock for the steam reformer, the gas produced contains 
50% more hydrogen than that which is required for the methanol synthesis reac-
tion, and this gas must be recovered at some stage in the process. However, as 
the molecular weight of the hydrocarbon increases, the amount of excess hydro-
gen produced falls with increasing molecular weight. When naphtha is used as 
the feedstock, the resulting synthesis gas is virtually stoichiometric for methanol 
synthesis. This is illustrated in the following equations:

Synthesis gas from natural gas feeds has, however, an excess of hydrogen but 
may be used directly if a high purge rate from the synthesis loop is acceptable. 
It is possible to adjust the ratio of hydrogen to carbon oxides by the addition 
of carbon dioxide to the synthesis gas, either just before the methanol synthesis 
loop, or directly into the feed for the steam reformer. It is also possible to use a 
secondary reformer using oxygen rather than air, after the primary reformer. The 
amount of oxygen used is adjusted to provide the stoichiometric ratio of hydro-
gen and carbon oxides and, at the same time, reduce the amount of inert methane 
in synthesis gas. (Table 9.9) 
 
9.7.2 OXO Synthesis Gas 
 
Typical steam reformers are used to produce synthesis gas for OXO reactions. It 
is usual to operate with a steam/carbon ratio of less than two with a recycle of 
sufficient carbon dioxide to provide a carbon dioxide/methane ratio of about two 
so that an appropriate composition of the gas product is obtained. 
 
9.7.3 Hydrogen Production 
 
For the production of hydrogen, the steam reformer is operated at high severity 
to obtain maximum methane conversion and early hydrogen plants used exactly 
the same catalysts as ammonia plants, except for the secondary reformer. The 
 
 Synthesis Gas 
  
391
hydrogen product is purified by catalytic conversion of the carbon monoxide, 
removal of carbon dioxide followed by methanation. This product is then ac-
ceptable for use in most refinery and chemical processes (see Table 9.9). 
More recently pressure swing absorption units using molecular sieves have 
replaced the carbon dioxide removal and methanation steps and, often, the LTS 
stage, to give very pure hydrogen. Only the HTS catalyst is retained to remove 
most of the carbon monoxide. Hydrogen of even greater purity can be obtained 
by operating at a low steam ratio in the steam reformer. 
 
9.7.4 Reducing Gas 
 
The direct reduction of iron ore in blast furnaces decreases the amount of high 
quality coke required and can also lead to an increase in the production capacity 
of the furnace. Gas with a high content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is 
produced at low pressure when natural gas is reformed using an almost stoichi-
ometric steam to carbon ratio. However, the low steam ratio results in a tenden-
cy for the deposition of carbon. Some of the top gas from the blast furnace, 
which has a carbon dioxide content of about 20%, is recycled to the steam re-
former to compensate for the low steam-to-carbon ratio and to provide the nec-
essary volumes of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The gas flow is upwards 
through the tubes, which are filled with large-diameter rings of catalyst to re-
duce pressure drop. The feed gas is pre-heated over inert rings, or even low ac-
tivity catalyst, before passing into the reformer stage in which high-activity, 
thermally-stable catalysts are used (see Table 9.17). 
 
9.7.5 Town Gas Production 
 
Town gas was first made on a large scale by the Chartered Gas Company in 
London during 1812. Production then spread throughout Europe and the USA. 
The discovery of natural gas in California during 1928 and then in other states 
led to its domestic use in the US particularly after long-distance pipelines were 
installed. By 1934 almost 40% of the US domestic supply came from natural gas 
and this increased rapidly to more than 95% by 1960. During the 1970s, when it 
was thought that US natural gas supplies were declining, about ten substitute 
natural gas (SNG) plants were built in the eastern states using the UK Gas 
Council’s catalytic rich gas (CRG) process. (Table 9.16) 
The burners used in domestic appliances at that time were not suitable for 
use with natural gas, because of its high calorific value. For this reason, natural 
gas was not used directly until the 1960s. Small cyclic reforming processes were 
introduced to meet peak demand when the supply of coal gas was insufficient to 
meet the requirements. Larger plants were installed to meet the needs of larger 
areas, and the relatively low calorific value of the reformer gas was increased to 
the required level by the addition of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons.14 
392 
 Chapter 9 
 
 
A wide range of catalysts produced by impregnating α-alumina or magnesia 
with low concentrations of nickel oxide were used in cyclic reformers. These 
catalysts had to be extremely heat resistant because the process generated carbon 
which was removed at intervals by burning in air. 
By 1960 the ICI naphtha steam reforming process was being used to make 
ammonia synthesis gas from the very cheap naphtha then available from Euro-
pean refineries. This process was easily adapted to make town gas simply by 
operating at lower reforming temperature. The reformed gas then contained a 
higher methane concentration. The calorific value of the gas was increased from 
385Btu per cubic foot to 500Btu per cubic foot by enrichment with hydrocar-
bons.14 More than 200 of these lean gas plants were built throughout the world 
before natural gas was used directly. (Table 9.17) 
At about the same time the British Gas Council developed its adiabatic pro-
cess in which naphtha or lighter hydrocarbons were converted into a high me-
thane content gas with a calorific value of almost 700 Btu per cubic foot. This 
gas could then be converted into town gas with a calorific value of 500 Btu per 
cubic foot by continuous steam reforming in a lean gas plant and appropriate 
blending. Since then the CRG process has also been widely used throughout the 
world to produce methane rich gas from naphtha and LPG. 
The CRG process operates adiabatically in a small single bed reactor. The 
catalyst has high nickel oxide content and is precipitated under carefully con-
trolled conditions with alumina to give a high activity and thermally stable struc-
ture. The finished catalyst is alkalized to prevent carbon formation and is re-
duced before operation. Steam to carbon ratio can be as low as 1.5 when reform-
ing naphtha to produce town gas. 
When operating with naphtha as feed, the endothermic reforming reaction is 
dominant at the top of the bed. As the concentrations of both hydrogen and car-
bon monoxide increase, the exothermic methanation reaction becomes the dom-
inant reaction so that the overall reaction is exothermic. Gradual catalyst deacti-
vation leads to the temperature profile moving down the bed and catalyst life 
can be as long as two years. With natural gas feed any hydrocarbons heavier 
than methane are reformed, the methane steam equilibrium is established, and 
the overall reaction is endothermic. Operating details are shown in Table 9.16. 
 
9.7.6 Substitute Natural Gas 
 
Substitute natural gas (SNG) may be obtained by methanation of CRG process 
gas with a stable nickel-alumina catalyst after removal of the carbon dioxide 
formed in the conventional process. Gas containing more than 98% methane can 
be produced. The CRG process is operated at low steam ratio to maximize me-
thane production. Two stages of methanation follow the CRG reactor and inter-
cooling is required to control the temperature. Standard alkalized, high nickel

achieved by variation in the steam and feed rates. The methane content was de-
pendent upon the amount of oxygen used in the enriched air, or the flow of oxy-
gen to the partial oxidation section of the process. The process could be adjusted 
to produce synthesis gas for methanol or OXO reactions by adding part of the 
hydrocarbon feed directly to the oxidation section. The appropriate carbon mon-
oxide/carbon dioxide and hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratios in the gas composi-
tion were obtained by adjusting the volume of secondary feed and the 
steam/carbon ratio of the primary feed, respectively.

SYNTHESIS 
 
 
 
 
10.1 AMMONIA SYNTHESIS 
In the early days, the composition of catalysts discovered and developed by Mit-
tasch that were used by BASF in the plants at Oppau and Leuna was kept secret. 
Apart from the fact that iron was used and that the process operated at high pres-
sure, little other technical information was available until after the war had end-
ed. When the new synthesis process was investigated in other European coun-
tries and the United States, many different catalyst promoters were listed in a 
large number of patent applications and in the technical literature.1 The wide 
variety of processes and catalysts developed during the 1920s reflects the diffi-
culties experienced in establishing suitable operating conditions. These technical 
difficulties, together with a static demand for ammonia, meant that only a few 
plants were actually built before 1940 and BASF retained a virtual monopoly on 
the manufacture of ammonia. 
Not all of the potential competitors used the catalyst promoters first intro-
duced by BASF and then later examined by Larson of the US Fixed Nitrogen 
Research laboratory.2 Other fused magnetite catalysts, containing promoters 
such as magnesia, silica and chromium, as well as those with the more efficient 
alumina, with potash and, perhaps calcium oxide, were used for a further twenty 
to thirty years. These gave reasonable results in the converters then in use3 as 
shown in Table 10.1. Poor catalysts could operate adequately when the synthesis 
gas was not purified efficiently and a short operating life was the norm.

By the time that the large capacity, single-stream ammonia plants were in-
troduced during the 1960s, all of the producers of ammonia had moved to the 
use of the iron oxide catalyst containing alumina, calcium oxide and potash. 
Magnetite was no longer produced by burning iron but was obtained naturally, 
probably from the source discovered by BASF in 1913-15. Magnesia, silica, and 
the other trace oxides present in the catalyst were, therefore, impurities from the 
natural magnetite and not added deliberately as promoters. Analytical details for 
a typical sample of magnetite are given in Table 10.2. 
The large new plants contained huge quantities of catalyst and the time tak-
en for reduction led to undesirable delays in starting production. A pre-reduced 
catalyst that could be activated quickly became available between 1955–60 and 
was widely accepted. The pre-reduced catalyst was based on the existing oxide 
catalysts and did not improve operation but could be commissioned more quick-
ly. 
The first chemically different catalyst, containing cobalt oxide, was devel-
oped by ICI and used in several large energy efficient plants during the 1980s.

The new catalyst was, however, still based on promoted magnetite containing up 
to about 20% cobalt oxide.4 The reaction kinetics were the same and, although 
the catalyst improved operation in several respects, large catalyst volumes were 
still required and the actual process did not really change. A new version of the 
cobalt-containing catalyst, prepared by precipitation from nitrate solution, was 
later evaluated by ICI.5 It showed extremely high activity, but the pellets were 
quite fragile after reduction and of lower density than fused catalysts. The cata-
lyst was not developed further. 
Commercial catalysts containing cobalt oxide could be reduced faster and 
operated at temperatures and pressures considerably lower than iron catalysts. 
Normal operation was at about 80 atmospheres compared with the usual 150 
atmospheres. While catalyst activity was the same, the catalyst was apparently 
more stable than the iron catalyst over the whole range of pressure and operating 
conditions. 
A significant advance was made in 1979 when BP demonstrated a new cata-
lyst based on ruthenium supported on carbon and promoted with barium and 
potassium.5 
 
10.1.1 Process Development from 1920 
 
The Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process led to similar developments in 
other European countries and the US. As a result, many other commercial pro-
cesses were being operated during the 1920s. Production rates were very small 
compared with modern plants but an extremely wide range of operating condi-
tions was introduced together with a number of different catalysts. Despite these 
initial differences, most plants built in recent years still operate with more or less 
the same conditions as those chosen for the first BASF process. Some of the 
early ammonia processes are listed in Table 10.3. 
 
10.1.1.1 Haber-Bosch Process 
 
The first reactors at Oppau and Leuna operated at about 200 bar pressure with 
temperatures in the range 500°-600°C. The system was not quite autothermal, 
that is, the exotherm from the synthesis reaction was not sufficient to sustain the 
process given the design of the reactor at that time. The catalyst was charged to 
a single reactor, somewhat like a tube, equipped with various heating devices 
used during start-up and operation. A modified Haber-Bosch reactor using 
chrome/vanadium steel that could operate at 300–350 bar pressure and lower 
temperatures led to an increase in the conversion of synthesis gas to ammonia 
because higher pressures and lower temperatures favour the concentration of 
ammonia at equilibrium. This also made the condensation of product ammonia 
easier and more efficient. The basic design operated without the use of sophisti-
cated  injector  circulators  and high pressure steam was not recovered.  It has

has been reported that a converter at Oppau, in which 20 tonnes ammonia per 
day was produced, weighed 70 tonnes, was 12 meters long and had an internal 
diameter of 0.8 meters.6 The time taken to change the catalyst and restart opera-
tion after a shut-down period was three days. There was a great deal of secrecy 
about the catalyst used by BASF at Oppau and patents during the 1920s give a 
confusing impression of the actual catalysts being developed by other compa-
nies.7 This is perfectly reasonable when it is remembered that experimental work 
was being reported. Most processes eventually used very similar catalyst types. 
 
10.1.1.2 Claude Process 
 
Georges Claude began work in France on an ammonia synthesis process during 
Paroisse and built a three tonnes per day Claude plant near Bethune. Initially, 
the pure synthesis gas was derived from hydrogen recovered from various 
sources such as coke-oven gas, and the liquid nitrogen was obtained from the 
l’Azote (SBA) who produced ammonia from 1923. 
The operating conditions for the process were a pressure of 1000 bar and a 
temperature of 550ºC. Under these conditions, a high conversion of around 40%, 
production of oxygen. L’Air Liquide later helped to form Societé Belge de 
close to the theoretical equilibrium conversion, was achieved despite impurities
that must have been present in the synthesis gas. The process was autothermal,
and even required some form of cooling. The converter was small and weighed
only 11 tonnes for a production of 20 tonnes ammonia per day.
1917 and, by 1919, l’Air Liquide had formed the Society Chimique de la Grande 
 
Ammonia and Methanol Synthesis  
401
Claude ammonia plants did not need to include recirculation of synthesis 
gas because of the high conversion to ammonia. Instead, four small converters, 
or ‘contacts’, were used. Two of the converters were operated in parallel, with 
the other two in series8. The gas was cooled and the ammonia removed between 
the “contacts”. This two-stage procedure combined with intermediate product 
removal probably accounts for such a high level of conversion, at such an early 
stage in the evolution of the industry. It was also claimed that the catalyst 
packed in an iron tube inside the pressure vessel and weighing some 750 kilo-
grams could be changed in only 10 minutes! Since discharged ammonia synthe-
sis catalyst is pyrophoric, one can only wonder about the procedure. 
The catalyst developed by Claude was made by oxidizing iron in a magne-
sia crucible under a strong jet of oxygen and contained 5-10% calcium oxide 
dissolved in the magnetite as it melted.8 The catalyst was reported to operate for 
several hundred hours. Most metallic iron at that time contained considerable 
amount of sulphur, which is a well-known poison for the ammonia synthesis 
catalyst. The removal of sulphur by burning the iron in air to form oxides of iron 
was developed by BASF. Although sulphur-free magnetite produced in this way 
led to the production of a satisfactory catalyst when the appropriate promoters 
had been added, the use of Swedish magnetite was, and still is, preferred. 
A useful procedure adopted by both Claude and BASF was the inclusion of 
a guard bed to absorb poisons, and to convert any residual carbon monoxide to 
methane. The guard bed usually contained spent catalyst that had been dis-
charged from the main converters, and operated at a temperature of 400ºC. A 
similar procedure was later used by many other operators to extend the life of 
the catalyst. 
The Claude Process was not very popular, and was developed further by 
Grande Paroisse to operate at a pressure of 600 bar, and to use pure make-up gas 
of the first reported to use calcium oxide as a catalyst promoter. 
 
10.1.1.3 Casale Process 
 
Luigi Casale developed a process in Italy that usually operated at pressures up to 
600 bar and gave a high conversion. The process operated more or less isother-
mally, and the high concentration of ammonia in the recycle gas was sufficient 
to allow product ammonia to be recovered by condensation with cooling water9 
at a temperature of 30ºC. In several early patents from Casale, it was shown that 
magnetite, free from volatile impurities, could be prepared by burning iron metal 
with oxygen in a magnesia crucible.10 Various promoters11 such as magnesia, 
lime and alumina were added to produce the fused catalyst. Casale was one of 
the earliest contractors to the chemical industry, and is still active in licensing a 
modified synthesis loop which is often used to re-vamp existing units.

10.1.1.4 United States of America 
 
Construction of the Oppau plant was announced in New York at the 8th Interna-
tional Congress of Applied Chemistry during September 1912 by Dr H A 
Bernthsen of BASF.12 At the time, however, demand for ammonia was not suffi-
cient to interest US companies in using the process. The General Chemical 
Company, who had discussed the sulfuric acid contact process with BASF in 
Germany, began pilot plant work in about 1913 to investigate ammonia synthe-
sis and to develop catalysts. The Bureau of Soils also established a small fixed 
nitrogen laboratory at the Arlington Farm Research Station in Virginia. 
The National Defense Act of June 1916 incorporated a bill providing for 
large-scale production of ammonia. By the time that the US had declared war in 
tee. These included an ammonia plant, with three units to make up to 30 tonnes 
per day of ammonia, at Sheffield, Alabama, designed by the General Chemical 
Company. Although one small unit, with a capacity of about seven tonnes per 
day, had been tested by the end of the war, there was difficulty in producing a 
reliable catalyst and the plant was closed down during January 1919. 
The US Fixed Nitrogen Committee visited Oppau during 1919 and was able 
to discover the main differences between the BASF and General Chemical 
Company processes.13 The main difference lay in the process conditions. The 
synthesis loop of the process in Germany was operated at a pressure of 200 bar, 
with a reaction temperature in the range 500–600ºC. This contrasts strongly with 
the process in Sheffield, which was operated at a pressure of only 100 bar and a 
much lower temperature of 400–450ºC. Such moderate reaction conditions 
would have required a significantly more active catalyst to have been successful. 
However, the catalyst used by BASF in Germany was derived from iron, pro-
moted with alumina and was more active than the catalyst used by the General 
Chemical Company in America which was made from “spongy” iron, promoted 
made by impregnating pumice with iron nitrate before heating it at 550°C and 
then reducing the oxide. Sodamide was deposited on the ‘spongy’ metal by a 
treatment with ammonia and melted sodium at 450°C. The catalyst was deac-
tivated by traces of water. 
Despite the problems at Sheffield, the Atmospheric Nitrogen Corporation, a 
subsidiary of the General Chemical Company, had built and operated a second 
plant with the same design at Syracuse, New York by 1921.14 The original ca-
pacity was 15 tonnes per day ammonia but it was later increased to 40 tonnes 
per day. This plant eventually used a fused iron oxide catalyst, promoted with 
alumina and potash, developed at the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory by A 
T Larson. It had first tested a catalyst developed by de Jahn of the General 
Chemical Company. 
1917, several nitrate plants were being considered by a Nitrates Supply Commit-
with sodamide. The Sheffield catalyst, which was not very efficient. It was

The Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, at the American University in 
Washington DC, had been set up in March 1919 to continue work on nitrogen 
fixation. Larson had determined that fused iron oxide containing 3% alumina 
and 1% potash was the most satisfactory catalyst. A guard bed of catalyst was 
also recommended to remove impurities from the synthesis gas before it entered 
the main reactor. Eventually the process was known as the American Process. 
Although it was originally based on the use of electrolytic hydrogen, many 
plants were built by the Nitrogen Engineering Corporation, later the Chemical 
Construction Corporation (Chemico), using other sources of synthesis gas.15 The 
Chemico ammonia process with a tube-cooled converter operating at 350 bar 
and 500°C maximum catalyst temperature was used in about 25% of US ammo-
nia plants up to the 1960s.16 The relatively low catalyst temperature was proba-
bly a result of the use of a refrigerated ammonia cooler/condenser which gave a 
lower ammonia content in the converter make-up gas and removed catalyst poi-
sons. 
 
10.1.1.5 Mont Cenis/Uhde Process 
 
Friedrich Uhde signed a contract to build an ammonia plant for Gewerkschaft 
Mont Cenis of Sodingen during 1925. Uhde’s ambition had been to design an 
ammonia plant which did not infringe the BASF patents. He was able to do this 
after meeting Ivar Cederberg from Sweden who had been active in ammonia 
process design for many years. Cederberg, with the Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk 
Company had developed catalysts based on complex iron cyanides.17 Other met-
als such as ruthenium or osmium could be used instead of iron but were more 
expensive and unobtainable in large quantities. Following reduction to alpha-
iron at 300° the catalysts derived from the complex cyanides were active at tem-
peratures as low as 400ºC, but suffered from poor thermal stability. 18 
 The Mont Cenis Process was operated at a pressure in the range 100-120 
bar, and at temperatures below 450ºC because the catalyst was unstable at higher 
temperatures. Several of these low-pressure plants were built before 1930. Since 
then Uhde has designed many conventional ammonia plants and the associated 
ammonia converters (Figure 10.1). One of his innovations was the use of tube-
cooled converters to improve heat exchange and to preheat inlet gas to maintain 
a more uniform temperature through the catalyst.19

made catalysts from a variety of magnetites. These included burnt horseshoe 
nails and drum scrap, or any other source of cheap iron provided that volatile 
poisons could be removed during oxidation at high temperature. 
The catalyst is prepared by fusion of a mixture of magnetite and the pro-
moters, which normally includes alumina and potash, in an electric arc furnace 
at a temperature of approximately 1700ºC. The melt should be thoroughly ho-
mogeneous, before being chill-cast in a shallow tray, and then broken into small 
particles. The particles are then sieved into several size fractions, to be used ac-
cording to the requirements of the converter. Any oversized material is normally 
crushed again, sieved, and all of the combined undersized particles are then re-
cycled back to the furnace. The catalyst mix crystallises rapidly when cooled 
below a temperature of 570ºC to form a solid solution of wustite and alumina in 
the magnetite crystal lattice. Promoters are usually added as carbonates, oxides 
or hydroxides, although potassium is often added as a nitrate. A visual examina-
tion of the particles will show any inadequate mixing of promoters as white 
specks. 
The final product is essentially a mixture of magnetite (Fe3O4) and wustite 
(FeO) with a surface area in the range 1–2 m2/g. Magnetite has a spinel structure 
of cubic packed oxygen atoms with one third ferrous and two thirds ferric ions 
occupying the 24 tetrahedral and octahedral positions.  
Alumina is incorporated as a solid solution of the iron aluminate spinel, 
hercynite, in the crystal lattice. The alumina concentration should be less than 
the solubility of alumina in magnetite. This corresponds to a maximum content 
of about 3% alumina. Any excess of alumina does not go into solid solution, and 
leads to a reduction in catalytic activity, particularly when using catalysts pro-
moted with alumina. The presence of alumina as a structural promoter also leads 
to the formation of wustite and stabilizes the reduced catalyst. Small amounts of 
magnesia can also dissolve into magnetite and act as a promoter. The calcium 
component exists in the form of ferrites or aluminates by neutralizing acidic 
components—such as silica—and protects the potash that activates the catalyst. 
 
Ammonia and Methanol Synthesis

Calcium compounds can also help in stabilizing the reduced catalyst but do have 
a potentially adverse effect as high levels make catalyst reduction more difficult. 
The potassium ferrites form during catalyst production increase catalyst ac-
tivity up to about 0.8% potash but above this level activity falls. Ammonia cata-
lysts are said to be doubly-promoted. This is because alumina—a structural 
promoter—helps control and stabilize both the porosity and surface area of the 
reduced catalyst; on the other hand, potash—an electronic promoter—increases 
the catalyst activity. Other promoters may have similar effects but usually inter-
act with poisons or impurities to protect the catalyst. 
 
10.1.2.2 Pre-reduced Catalysts 
 
Ammonia synthesis catalysts are prepared in the form of magnetite which must 
be carried out slowly to avoid the accumulation of high levels of water in the 
reducing gas. Reduced catalysts lose activity if they are subjected to a high par-
tial pressure of water vapour and since the linear gas velocity is relatively low in 
large diameter converters, the reduced catalyst can suffer some re-oxidation due 
to back mixing of the reducing gas. As a rule, the water content of the gas exit-
ing the converter has been limited to a maximum of 3000 ppm, so that a reason-
able compromise between maximum activity and the shortest realistic reduction 
time can be achieved. 
For this reason, it is now common practice for catalyst producers to manu-
facture ammonia synthesis catalyst in the pre-reduced form. This is a routine 
procedure that takes in specially designed units where the process can be care-
fully controlled (Figure 10.3). After reduction, the catalyst is carefully stabilized 
by a controlled flow of a mixture of nitrogen gas and air so that less than 10% of 
the iron is re-oxidized with a thin film of oxide forming around the iron parti-
cles. This allows the catalyst to be loaded into commercial reactors and commis-
sioned in a fraction of the time taken with standard catalyst. Reduction begins at 
about 330°C compared with 400°C for standard catalyst. One of the main ad-
vantages in using pre-reduced catalyst is that a smaller capacity start-up heater 
can be used, and that the reduction period can be much shorter. The rapid reduc-
tion of pre-reduced catalyst in the top bed of a multi-bed converter allows the 
exothermic ammonia synthesis reaction to begin much sooner. The heat from 
this exotherm is sufficient to supplement the heat from the smaller start-up heat-
er so that ordinary catalyst can be reduced in the lower beds, and overall, the 
production of ammonia can begin within one to two days, compared with the 
usual four to seven days. 
 
 
 
volumes of catalyst, this can take several days. The reduction process must 
be activated by reduction to metallic iron before use. In plants using large

10.1.2.4 Catalyst Discharge from the Converter 
 
Spent ammonia synthesis catalyst contains very small crystallites of iron, which 
are extremely reactive, much more so than bulk iron metal. These residues are 
potentially pyrophoric in air and can react with water to produce hydrogen. Ex-
treme care is therefore required when they are discharged from a converter. 
The catalysts are not usually oxidized before being discharged from a con-
verter but, after cooling to ambient temperature, it is important that the converter 
should not be exposed to air. The converter is usually purged with nitrogen. Cat-
alyst suppliers and contractors provide special instructions for the procedure. 
Water should be sprayed onto catalyst as it is discharged from the converter.  
 
10.1.3 
Catalyst Reduction 
 
gen or, more usually, synthesis gas can be used, at pressures in the range 70–100 
bar. Gas leaving the bed being reduced should be cooled until reduction is com-
within a given bed for up to four beds can take about four to seven days. 
 
10.1.3.1 Reduction of Oxidized Catalyst 
 
A typical converter, in a plant with a dosage capacity 1000 tonnes per day am-
monia, will hold 100–200 tonnes of catalyst, which generates as much as 35–70 
tonnes of water during reduction. Ammonia synthesis begins before all of the 
catalyst has been reduced, the aqueous ammonia produced must be used in the 
most convenient way. The reduction procedure is deliberately carried out at a 
very low rate, to ensure optimum activity of the final catalyst. The presence of 
high partial pressures of water vapour in contact with the freshly reduced cata-
lyst results in the growth of the small crystallites within the catalyst, via a re-
oxidation mechanism. This growth in crystallite size is inevitably accompanied 
by a reduction of the metal surface area, and hence an irreversible loss of activi-
ty. The concentration of water vapour in the process gas is therefore limited to a 
maximum of about 3000 ppm. Concentrations higher than these have been al-
lowed but this requires good gas mixing in the wide diameter beds and rapid 
disengagement of water from the reduced particles. Back mixing of reducing 
gas, containing water, can lead to re-oxidation and loss of activity. Gas flow 
should therefore be as high as possible, the temperature of the bed carefully con-
trolled and water content of reducing gas at the converter inlet should also be as 
low as possible. The cumulative volume of water collected during reduction can 
be used as a practical indication of how reduction is proceeding and should be 
carefully measured.

During the early stages of catalyst reduction, the maximum rate of gas flow 
is limited by the thermal capacity of the start-up heater to maintain the tempera-
ture of the bed. As more catalyst becomes reduced, the exothermic synthesis 
reaction begins. The heat from this exotherm supplements the output from the 
start-up heater, and the gas rate can be increased. The rate of increase of a bed 
inlet temperature should be limited to about 5°C per hour until a maximum out-
let temperature of 500°C is reached. During this procedure, the temperature of 
the remaining unreduced catalyst beds should be just below the reduction tem-
perature that is about 350°C for typical catalysts. As more beds are reduced, gas 
rates can be increased and the reduction rate is faster despite the larger catalyst 
volumes in the lower beds. 
 
10.1.3.2 Reduction of Pre-reduced Catalyst 
 
Pre-reduced catalysts can be reduced much more quickly than oxidized catalyst 
because only about 10% of the catalyst is re-oxidized during stabilization. The 
procedure, therefore, only takes about one day. Early difficulties when pre-
reduced catalysts were unstable and could overheat on exposure to air have been 
overcome and the catalyst is now very stable. It is wise, however, to take sensi-
ble precautions while loading a converter because of the large quantities of cata-
lyst involved. 
The proportion of pre-reduced catalyst used depends on the time allowed 
for reduction and how easily the by-product aqueous ammonia can be used. Op-
erating costs are balanced with the higher price of the catalyst. Using pre-
reduced catalyst in only the top section of a reactor simplifies the early stages of 
reduction and speeds up commissioning. A full charge of pre-reduced catalyst 
allows much earlier production of ammonia but is more expensive. Although 
water evolution from pre-reduced catalyst is normally low, it is still usual to 
reduce only one bed at a time. 
 
10.1.3.3 Mechanism of Catalyst Reduction 
 
α-Iron is produced when ammonia synthesis catalyst is reduced.22 The catalyst is 
initially non-porous, with a surface area of only 1–2 m2 g-1, but on reduction, the 
catalyst becomes porous and develops a surface area around 20 m2 g-1. The re-
duction mechanism is unusual and is controlled by the wustite in the catalyst. 
reduced to form iron at a lower temperature than that normally required for bulk 
catalyst reduction. This provides iron nuclei for further reduction. Ferrous ions 
then diffuse through the magnetite structure to the reaction centers where they 
combine with magnetite to form wustite, which is also reduced, and the cycle 
continues, gradually forming the pore structure needed. There is an optimum 
wustite concentration so that diffusion of ferrous ions is not restricted. 
Large pores form at the surface as wustite surrounding the magnetite crystals is

The formation of ammonia on the reduced iron surface is extremely struc-
ture sensitive and the 111 and 211 planes are by far the most reactive of the five 
possible crystal surfaces. The close-packed 111 plane, for example, at the base 
of each plate-like crystal can expose three layers of iron atoms. Potential active 
sites may, therefore, have seven near neighbour iron atoms that are more active 
and less easily poisoned than sites with fewer near neighbour atoms. The most

The Ammonia Synthesis Process 
 
Since the Haber process was first introduced, there has been a gradual evolution 
of both the process and converter designs as the production capacity of the 
plants has increased. Until the 1950s, there were very few changes to either the 
converter, synthesis loop or the catalyst formulations used by individual compa-
nies shown earlier in the chapter, in Table 10.3. This was partly because of iner-
tia and because most plants operated with several ammonia converters each 
holding a few tonnes of a relatively cheap catalyst that could be conveniently 
changed during shutdown periods. This situation altered during the 1960s as 
larger capacity, single stream plants, using steam reforming and with a single 
ammonia converter, were built in all parts of the world.
 
10.1.4.1 The Ammonia Synthesis Loop 
 
The ammonia synthesis reaction occurs in a loop where synthesis gas can be 
circulated continuously through a converter containing the catalyst (Figure 
10.5). Ammonia is condensed and removed from the loop while synthesis gas, 
known as make-up gas, is added to maintain the design space velocity through 
the catalyst. In most ammonia plants, the inert gases, such as methane and ar-
gon, accumulating in the loop are continuously removed in a purge gas stream, 
so that they do not reach an unacceptable level. There is no longer any need in 
modern plants to install a guard bed to protect the catalyst now that steam-
reformed synthesis gas is poison free. Fresh make-up gas is usually added before 
ammonia is condensed. This means that poisons such as traces of compressor oil 
or oxygen compounds are removed with the liquid ammonia. Typical composi-
tions of circulating gas, converter outlet gas and purge gas for a low-pressure 
ammonia loop are show in Table 10.5. 
 A liquid nitrogen wash used to remove inerts from the make-up gas 
which then contained less than 240 ppm methane was incorporated into some of 
the early plants. However, it was found that the inerts were preferentially dis-
solved in the product ammonia and they did not accumulate in the recycle gas in

loop, resulting in a lower concentration of ammonia in the recycle gas. Since the 
maximum conversion of the synthesis gas to ammonia is limited by the thermo-
dynamics of the reaction, the lower concentration of ammonia in the recycle gas 
led to an overall increase in the conversion of synthesis gas to ammonia. It also 
became possible to operate with a smaller converter, and still maintain the same 
level of production. By the 1960s, refrigeration had become essential when op-
erating the low-pressure ammonia converters, as the equilibrium concentration 
of ammonia at 50-bar pressure is only about 12%, and the concentration of am-
monia in the recycle gas was reduced to about 2%. 
 
10.1.4.2 Converter Design 
 
The majority of early ammonia plants used adiabatic beds of catalyst or tube-
cooled converters that acted like a heat exchanger with the cold synthesis gas 
passing through the tubes to cool the catalyst. Tube-cooled reactors, such as 
those introduced by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), did not operate iso-
thermally and the exothermic reaction led to both axial and radial temperature 
profiles developing. The temperature difference depended on the number of 
tubes passing through the catalyst bed.  The converter design took this into ac-
count by maximizing the number of tubes although the temperature profile could 
only be controlled by changing the inlet gas temperature. There were problems 
in loading catalyst into the space between tubes to achieve the right packing 
density as well as in discharging catalyst when it was deactivated. Large tube-
cooled converters were also expensive. 
Modern converters are designed with several catalyst beds in which the hot 
Quench cooling has usually been preferred in plants using multi-bed converters 
some of the catalyst with a significant volume of the synthesis gas. The same 
Problems were experienced in wide, multi-bed converters, with gas flowing 
axially through the beds, because big catalyst particles were required to limit the 
pressure drop through the catalyst. Since activity is inversely proportional to 
increased the capital cost of a plant. By designing converters in such a way that 
gas flowed radially through the catalyst bed, it was possible to decrease the 
overall pressure drop and to use smaller catalyst particles that did not suffer 
from the limitations of pore diffusion to the same extent, and thus showed great-
er activity per unit volume.   Gas distribution problems in the top bed—
resulting from a low-pressure drop—were overcome by the use of an improved 
converter design. In one case, an axial-radial flow system was used. In another,

10.1.5 New Catalyst Developments 
 
At the stage of development of the ammonia synthesis reaction as described in 
the previous sections, the main problem was the low level of conversion of syn-
thesis gas to ammonia. This could be increased by operation at yet higher pres-
sure, but this would not be cost effective. The other option would be to operate 
at lower temperature, under which conditions, the equilibrium concentration of 
ammonia would be appreciably higher. Unfortunately, the catalysts available at 
the time were not sufficiently active to operate at the lower temperature required 
to make a meaningful difference to the concentration of ammonia in the product

gas, and hence a significant difference to the economics of the process. Any real 
improvement to the process was therefore dependent upon the development of a 
new catalyst with significantly improved activity. The clear target would be a 
catalyst with sufficient activity to give a satisfactory level of conversion at the 
same pressure as that within the reformer. 
 
10.1.5.1 Magnetite Catalyst Containing Cobalt 
 
The surface area of the ammonia synthesis catalyst is only about 1–2 m2g-1. It 
was known from experience with other catalysts that precipitation from aqueous 
solution always led to a product with a much higher surface area than one pre-
pared by fusion, and therefore potentially at least, more active sites per unit 
weight of catalyst. This process route was studied in ICI, initially by Topham. 
Subsequent developments led to the preparation and testing of a precipitated 
catalyst containing cobalt which showed levels of activity approximately 3 fold 
higher that of the best conventional catalyst available at the time.4a Ammonia 
could be synthesised at temperatures below 350ºC, but the catalyst was not 
commercialised for several reasons. The major reason was that the pelleted ox-
ide was significantly weakened during the reduction procedure, and became too 
weak to withstand the rigours of an axial flow converter. It also suffered from 
shrinkage during reduction, leading to settling of the bed, and the likely devel-
opment of hot-spots. 
 The ICI cobalt catalyst, which is reported to contain 10-20% cobalt oxide, 
was developed for use at 80 bar synthesis pressure and maximum temperatures 
as low as 460°C. These conditions were significantly different from the usual 
single-stream ammonia plants which operated at 150 bar or higher and tempera-
tures up to 500°C. 
From experimental work with precipitated cobalt-iron catalysts it appeared 
that the cobalt reacted with alumina giving cobalt spinels, which helped to form 
smaller iron and cobalt crystallites during reduction and to increase the surface 
area to make the catalyst more stable and less sensitive to oxide forming poi-
sons. In the presence of potash, cobalt was able to decrease the reduction tem-
perature. 
Development work was successful and, following a typical fusion produc-
tion procedure, the new catalyst could be reduced and operated at lower temper-
ature under normal conditions in conventional plants. Reduction began at 380°C 
in the new AMV and LCA processes introduced by ICI in 1985 and 1988 re-
spectively. The AMV plants have operated at more than 100% capacity of a 
pressure of only 60 bar. The life of the new catalyst has been very satisfactory, 
and could be operated of pressures much closer to those of the reformers, albeit 
with large converters.

10.1.5.2 Ruthenium Catalyst 
 
The announcement in 1979 by BP of a ruthenium catalyst was the first real ad-
vance in improving the process.  The catalyst was more active and operated at a 
lower temperature to produce a higher equilibrium ammonia concentration. A 
relatively high operating pressure was still needed, however, when using a bed 
charged with Ru catalyst in conjunction with other beds containing magnetite 
catalysts.
The catalyst was reversibly poisoned by some of the impurities pre-
sent in typical synthesis gas.  
 
10.1.5.3 Catalyst Preparation 
 
Little information is available on the commercial production of the ruthenium 
synthesis catalyst. A typical catalyst prepared according to a Canadian patent 
has, however, been compared with typical iron catalysts. Many other patent ref-
erences have also been included in a review of non-iron catalysts.  Descriptions 
stress the importance of the thermal treatment of the carbon support to control 
its structure. 
Carbon is heated up to at least 1000°C in an inert or reducing atmosphere. 
The acid surface of the carbon then becomes basic with no effect on the pore 
structure. The heat treatment deactivates the carbon against the reaction with 
hydrogen to form methane during subsequent operation. Commercial coconut 
charcoals, or those produced from hard woods or cellulose, can be used. It is 
important to use a support with a relatively low surface area of less than 700

The carbon can be impregnated with the active metal and two promoters, in 
the following sequence, being dried and heated to 250°C between each stage: 
• 2% of barium as nitrate; 
• 4% of ruthenium as chloride which is more stable than other salts and 
gives a better metal distribution; 
• 12% of potassium or cesium as hydroxide.

sensitive to hydrogen concentration. A typical 3:1 hydrogen-nitrogen ratio inhib-
its the activity of ruthenium. Much better operation is possible at temperatures 
as low as 400°C with 1:1 hydrogen-nitrogen ratio. 
Further work has shown that cesium is a better promoter than potassium and 
that the alkali hydroxides are, surprisingly, reduced to a metallic state during 
catalyst activation. This seems thermodynamically improbable, but may result 
from the high heat of adsorption of the alkali metal hydroxides on carbon, which 
leads to charge transfer to the carbon, and could drive the reduction of the hy-
droxide to the metal. The alkali promoter may neutralize residual chloride ions 
and develop catalyst activity during reduction as ruthenium ions diffuse from the 
lattice to form crystallites on the edges of graphite crystals. 
Ruthenium, promoted by alkali metals and barium and then supported on 
carbon, has provided a significant increase in activity compared with iron cata-
lysts. The high cost of ruthenium when compared with iron must have led to it 
being used with the cheap support material. In retrospect, the complex interac-
tion between carbon, alkali metal and barium with the active ruthenium led to 
the development of a successful catalyst. A magnesium oxide support has now 
been claimed to give a longer life than carbon.  
 
10.1.5.4 Full-scale Operation with Ruthenium Catalyst 
 
The new ruthenium catalyst has been used in the Pacific Ammonia Inc plant at 
Kitimat in British Columbia since 1992.  Ammonia had been made there, from 
the methanol plant purge gas, since 1986 using a conventional iron synthesis 
catalyst. The new ruthenium catalyst converter was in series with the old con-
verter. Although in 1992 there was no additional synthesis gas to increase pro-
duction capacity, the ruthenium catalyst operated well in a radial flow reactor 
and reduced both the steam and electricity used by 30-40% and 5-10% respec-
tively. The new catalyst was said to be twenty times as active as the iron cata-
lyst, and the effluent gas contained about 20% ammonia. 
The catalyst was reduced at 300ºC, and took less than one day, with the 
evolution of only small amounts of water. The catalyst was operated at lower 
pressures and temperatures than the iron catalyst, and in marked contrast, could 
also tolerate the presence of 4000 ppm of carbon monoxide, with little or no 
effect on activity. 
Other large ammonia plants are now using single beds of the ruthenium cat-
alyst in conjunction with the magnetite catalyst. They confirm the higher activity 
of ruthenium, with the benefits of a lower operating pressure and temperature, 
while maintaining a high concentration of ammonia in the exit gas. For future 
process designs, the need for less gas compression and less high-pressure 
equipment will lead to lower operating and capital costs. Two plants in Trinidad, 
using one bed of iron catalyst and three beds of ruthenium catalyst, have operat-
ed for several years.32 It is reported that the capacity of typical 1100 tonnes per

day plant designs could be increased to 1850 tonnes per day, provided there is 
sufficient reformer capacity. 
10.2 
 METHANOL SYNTHESIS 
Experiments during the nineteenth century had shown that certain oxides could 
be used as dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, Jahn dehydrogenated meth-
anol by passing the vapour over finely divided zinc or zinc oxide to produce a 
stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  
Subsequently, patents covering the conversion of synthesis gas to complex 
mixtures of organic oxygen compounds, including methanol, were issued to 
BASF during 1913.  This followed work by Mittasch and Schneider. Full-scale 
production of methanol was not attempted, however, until 1923. By that time 
high-pressure equipment had been in operation for several years in the new am-
monia process. The methanol process was developed by Piers and the plant, 
built at Leuna, used mixed zinc oxide-chromic oxide catalyst. The use of metal-
lic iron for the internal parts of the reactor was avoided to prevent the formation 
of the volatile iron pentacarbonyl. The would have decomposed on the surface 
of the catalyst, to deposit finely divided iron metal, which in turn would have 
promoted the exothermic formation of methane.  
 
10.2.1 High-Pressure Synthesis 
 
Although coal based water gas was used as feed to the methanol plant the cata-
lyst was probably developed in conjunction with work on coal hydrogenation 
and the Fischer Tropsch process. The aim of the process had been the production 
of a range of liquid hydrocarbons but it was found that the high-pressure reac-
tion with water gas formed very pure methanol. The methanol was tested as a 
fuel for automobiles, but this was unsuccessful because of knocking in the low 
compression engines then being used. Other applications for methanol were 
soon developed as, for example, bakelite was introduced. 
 
10.2.1.1 Zinc Oxide-Chromium Oxide Catalysts 
 
The BASF catalysts were made by mixing solid chromic acid with an aqueous 
suspension of zinc hydroxide, drying the paste and forming granules. Later an 
even simpler catalyst was made by mixing zinc oxide powder with chromic ox-
ide, making a paste with water and then granulating.  The catalysts were not 
particularly active and heat evolution had to be carefully controlled during re-
duction. 
During the 1920s the methanol process and various catalysts were widely 
studied both in Europe and in the US. It has been assumed that Patart, in France, 
35
36

 Chapter 10 
 
investigated zinc oxide catalysts, containing other metals, as a result of Jahn’s 
observations. Patart operated a semi-technical scale reactor with a zinc oxide 
catalyst supported on asbestos. The patent, issued in 1921,  and other published 
work  gave many details of methanol production. Later on Patart worked with 
zinc oxide catalysts containing copper oxide although best results were obtained 
with a 3:1 molar mixture of zinc oxide and chromic acid.  
Active and stable catalysts containing an excess of zinc oxide were eventu-
ally made by co-precipitation of soluble zinc and chromium salts. Natta did, 
however, show that the natural zinc carbonate, Smithsonite, which contained 
impurities such as cadmium, magnesium and copper, had a high stable activity.40 
While copper oxide in combination with zinc oxide or other supports was an 
active catalyst, it was unstable at high temperature and easily poisoned by the 
impurities in water gas. 
From about 1930 onwards, all catalysts used industrially, for example by 
BASF, Du Pont, Montedison and ICI, were based on zinc oxide stabilized by the 
high melting chromium oxide. The actual composition depended largely on 
whether the catalyst was precipitated or was just a simple mixture of oxides. 
The catalysts were prepared either by mixing or precipitation of the compo-
nents, drying, followed by calcination in the temperature range, 400–450ºC. The 
catalyst powder was then compacted and formed into granules or pellets. When 
the temperature of the catalyst rose above 200ºC, it was found that the chromi-
um oxide component, particularly in the case of precipitated catalysts, was par-
tially oxidised to the hexavalent state. However, as the temperature rose higher, 
the hexavalent chromium decomposed back to the trivalent state. Consequently, 
the high chrome catalysts prepared by mixing the oxides must have been partial-
ly pre-reduced before use, because of the redox cycles. Nevertheless, they often 
cracked or lost particle strength. All precipitated catalysts had to be calcined at a 
high enough temperature to limit the presence of hexavalent chromium, which 
Zinc oxide-chromium oxide catalysts are often referred to as zinc chromite 
but there is always a considerable excess of zinc oxide. The catalysts are rela-
tively stable at temperatures when zinc oxide alone would lose activity, the 
chromium, perhaps present as a spinel,  is believed to stabilize the zinc oxide. 
Maximum activity was claimed for precipitated catalysts containing 20-30% 
chromium oxide.  However, these catalysts were rather unstable, due to shrink-
age in use, and longer life could be achieved with a lower chromium contents. 
From the limited information available, precipitated industrial catalysts general-
ly contained less than 20% chromium oxide as shown in Table 10.8.

surface area of the zinc oxide    and that these properties could be controlled by

It was suggested that the relatively unstable mixed oxide catalysts could be 
supplied in the pre-reduced form that was, effectively, pre-shrunk. While these 
catalysts were offered for use commercially, there is no evidence that operation 
was actually improved.  In any case, the maximum operating temperature in a 
high-pressure methanol plant was limited to 390°C by the onset of methanation 
so that a stable activity was more important than high activity in the multibed 
reactors used. 
Lazier of Du Pont published many patents covering the preparation of metal 
chromites.  These were formed by precipitation from a solution of zinc nitrate 
and chromic acid with ammonia at pH 6.8. The zinc ammine complex obtained 
was decomposed at about 400°C to give the mixed oxides. As Adkins noted, his 
copper chromite equivalent was extracted with dilute acetic acid solution to ad-
just the copper content. It is not clear whether the same treatment was ever used 
in producing methanol catalysts or even whether the zinc ammine intermediate 
was produced commercially. One problem with the Lazier preparation was the 
difficulty in controlling the exothermic decomposition of the ammine that could 
affect the catalyst activity. 
Other companies preferred to precipitate the catalyst from solutions of the 
cheaper zinc sulfate and chromium sulfate (chrome tan) with sodium carbonate. 
An active catalyst, with a long life, could be produced although only about 90% 
of the metals were recovered. This resulted from the variable pH of the solution 
and the partial solubility of the precipitates at about pH 7 during the precipita-
tion procedure. Significant amounts of sulfate and sodium, in the form of chro-
mium complexes, also remained in the final catalyst although this did not appear 
to result in loss of activity or to cause operating problems.

5.0 cubic meters was divided into five beds, with inter-bed cooling to limit the 
temperature rise, in a one-meter diameter reactor. The recycle loop, similar to 
that in ammonia synthesis, had a high circulation rate of 150,000 m3hr-1 so that 
space velocity in the catalyst was up to 30,000 hr–1. A typical set of operating 
conditions is shown in Table 10.9 for a plant of this kind, which also shows the 
temperature increase in each bed, the methanol concentration in effluent leaving 
the final bed and the composition of synthesis gas entering the reactor. 
About 2–5wt% of organic byproducts including about 1% of dimethyl ether, 
apart from water, formed during the reaction and the amount usually increased 
as the catalyst aged (a list of by-product formation is shown in Table 10.14.) A 
significant amount of methane was also formed, particularly at temperatures in 
excess of 390ºC. Much of this was formed on metallic iron, deposited on the 
catalyst by the thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl. Thus, the maxi-
mum operating temperature of the catalyst was severely limited. And the tem-
perature of the reactor was controlled by inter-bed quench cooling with cold 
synthesis gas. 
The loss of activity and selectivity from catalyst sintering and deactivation 
increasing the bed temperatures. The main operating problem was usually an 
increase in pressure drop. For this reason, after about two years’ use, the catalyst 
was carefully removed from the beds in layers and sieved to remove dust. About 
70% of the catalyst could often be replaced providing that it had adequate physi-
cal strength and an acceptable surface area, exceeding about 35 m2/gm. A typi-
cal catalyst life, after two or three sieving cycles, was 4–5 years. Some surface 
area measurements on discharged samples from a five-bed unit are given in Ta-
ble 10.10. The surface area of new, precipitated catalyst was about 50m2/gm

although,  following reduction, the surface area increased to  65–70m /gm.

10.2.2 
Low-pressure Synthesis 
 
The first industrial methanol catalysts, used from 1923, were based on zinc ox-
ide-chromium oxide mixtures. Experimental work during development of the 
process had, however, demonstrated the high activity of zinc oxide catalysts 
containing copper. This was particularly true if a third refractory oxide such as 
chromia or alumina was also added.  Catalysts containing copper are particular-
ly susceptible to poisoning. At that time the synthesis gas was produced from 
water gas, and contained poisons such as sulfur and chlorine compounds so that 
copper catalysts were unsuitable. 
 
When the hydrocarbon steam reforming process could provide poison free 
synthesis gas, the benefits of the more active copper catalysts were quickly re-
viewed. It was soon shown that the high activity of copper oxide-zinc oxide cat-
alysts, compared with the zinc oxide-chromium oxide types, particularly when 
alumina or chromia promoters were added, could revolutionize methanol pro-
duction. New, more efficient processes were urgently needed in view of the in-
creasing demand for methanol and the economies of high capacity units.

10.2.2.1 Copper Oxide Catalysts 
 
The first full-scale trial of a copper catalyst to be reported took place in the 
Polish Chemical works at Oswiecim during 1963 but was not successful.  Tests 
showed that the precipitated copper oxide-zinc oxide catalysts available at the 
time were unstable and either sintered or were poisoned very quickly. Better 
formulations were investigated to develop large-scale production procedures and 
increase catalyst stability. Improved catalyst testing procedures provided de-
tailed information on the catalyst structure and activity. This demonstrated that 
the unstable catalysts contained large oxide crystals and that the metals were 
distributed unevenly within the structure. Better catalysts required very small 
crystals which were uniformly distributed.  It was soon found that catalysts 
containing copper oxide-zinc oxide-alumina could be made with the appropriate 
properties and a large, new plant was operating successfully by 1966.  Only one 
new high-pressure methanol plant has been built since the low-pressure process 
was introduced. 
Soon after the introduction of the catalyst stabilized with alumina, others, 
containing chromia, were also being produced. Processes based on both of the 
new catalysts were operating from 1971  and many patents were published as 
shown in Table 10.12. 
Synthesis gas was obtained from a variety of sources including the steam 
reforming of natural gas or naphtha and oil gasification. A flowsheet for a typi-
cal low-pressure methanol synthesis plant is given in Figure 10.8. The different 
reactor designs used in methanol synthesis are listed in Table 10.13 and some 
are shown in Figures 10.9 and 10.10. The correct carbon dioxide, as well as car-
bon monoxide, for the synthesis reaction to proceed. 
 
10.2.2.2 Copper Catalyst Production 
 
Until 1960, copper oxide-zinc oxide catalysts were usually precipitated in batch-
es. As with the zinc oxide-chromium oxide catalysts, an alkaline solution, such 
as  sodium carbonate,  was added to the  relatively  acidic solution  of the metal

A novel way to precipitate small particles was introduced to overcome the 
problem.  By continuous mixing of reactants in a jet, the carbonates could be 
precipitated at pH 7 so that the precipitate contained uniformly small, well-
mixed crystals and provided catalysts with a long, stable life. Continuous opera-
tion at 50-bar pressure was possible for three years in a 300 tonnes per day plant. 
By-product formation was significantly decreased in comparison with the zinc 
oxide-chromia catalysts as outlined in Table 10.14. 
As the demand for large, 1000 tonnes per day capacity plants increased, the 
operating pressure was optimized at 100 bar. The original catalyst was less sta-
ble at this pressure. However, by combining the alumina with a proportion of the 
zinc oxide, possibly in the form of a spinel, before precipitation of the copper 
component, an even more stable catalyst was produced.  Catalyst activity was 
proportional to the surface area of the metallic copper reduction, which also con-
trolled the stability of the catalyst during use. Continuous improvement of pro-
duction techniques and a better understanding of the catalyst precursors could 
increase catalyst life increased to about five years. 
 
10.2.2.3 Precipitates Forming During Production 
 
A mixture of basic copper and zinc carbonates is formed during the precipitation 
of the metal nitrates. These have general formulae similar to malachite—
Cu2(OH)2(CO3)—in which some of the copper is replaced by varying propor-
tions of zinc. The amorphous mineral georgeite, with the formula Cu2(OH)2CO3, 
has been identified in the precipitate. As the precipitate ages other minerals, 
such as aurichalcite and hydrozincite, form depending on the proportions of 
copper and zinc. Free aluminium ions in the solution can be incorporated in a

(Cu,Zn)2CO3(OH)2. 
The very small copper crystals that form after careful drying, calcination 
and reduction are very stable and the catalyst remains active for several years of 
plant operation. It has been suggested that the reduced copper is stabilized as 
clusters of copper atoms at the oxygen rich (001) surface of the zinc oxide. In 
turn, the zinc oxide is stabilized by small zinc aluminate particles or other re-
fractory oxides. The addition of small amounts of magnesium oxide enhances 
the stabilizing effect of zinc oxide.  Zinc oxide can also absorb any traces of 
sulfur or chlorine in synthesis gas. 
 
10.2.2.4 Operation with Copper Catalysts 
 
It is clear that the mixed copper oxide/zinc oxide/alumina formulation is an ex-
cellent catalyst in the low-pressure methanol process. There has been much de-
bate in explaining the role of copper in the reaction and how methanol is pro-
duced. The group that invented the catalyst examined a number of possibili-
ties:53 
• Was methanol synthesized from carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide? 
• Was the copper oxide reduced or oxidized during the synthesis process 
and what active sites were formed? 
• What reactions were taking place on the active surface and how did this 
affect the process? 
It has been concluded from experimental work with catalysts containing 
alumina that methanol forms from carbon dioxide and that the catalyst activity is 
proportional to the copper metal surface area. The presence of carbon dioxide in 
the gas increases the synthesis rate. The zinc oxide and alumina play little part in 
the actual reaction apart from stabilizing the reduced copper and protecting it 
from the effect of any poisons. On the other hand, with catalysts containing 
chromia, the carbon dioxide leads to a decrease in the reaction rate.

taking place has been summarized as:
A vital stage of the catalyst preparation is the aging period, in which the
structure of the precipitate changes, to produce the appropriate copper zinc and
aluminium distribution in the final catalyst. During aging, it is significant that
the initial blue precipitate changes color to blue-green. The sequence of changes

Reaction Mechanism with Copper Catalysts 
 
During operation, the reduced copper metal surface is partly covered by mobile 
oxygen atoms and carbon dioxide is adsorbed on the ‘oxidized’ copper. Carbon 
dioxide is then able to react with hydrogen adsorbed on the reduced copper sur-
face. A formate intermediate is reduced first to a methoxy group and then to 
methanol. Oxygen remaining on the copper surface can either react with ad-
sorbed carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide or to react with hydrogen to 
form water which also provides more carbon dioxide by the water gas shift reac-
tion with carbon monoxide. Depending on the ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon 
monoxide in synthesis gas, up to 30% of the reduced copper can be covered with 
adsorbed oxygen. The proportion of adsorbed oxygen also depends on the ox-
ides in the support. These reactions are summarized as follows: 
 
 
H2O  ↔  H2 + O(ads) (H2O + CO  ↔  CO2 + H2) 
(10.1) 
 
 
  
H2  →  2 H(ads) 
(10.2) 
 
 
  
CO2  →  CO2(ads) 
(10.3) 
 
 
  
CO2(ads) + H(ads)  →  HCOO(ads) 
(10.4) 
 
 
  
HCOO(ads) + 2 H(ads)  →  CH3O(ads) + O(ads) 
(10.5) 
 
 
  
H(ads) + CH3O(ads)  →  CH3OH 
(10.6) 
 
 
  
O(ads) + CO  ↔  CO2 
(10.7) 
  
 
It is important to emphasize that the mobile, active sites are formed from 
adjacent copper atoms and surface oxide. Much of this work has been the sub-
ject of a review by the ICI group.  
 
10.2.2.6 Selectivity 
 
Mixed oxide methanol synthesis catalysts containing copper are very selective 
and the selectivity of the conversion of carbon oxides to methanol exceeds 99%. 
This is simply explained because there is no splitting of carbon-oxygen bonds 
when carbon oxides are adsorbed on the copper surface. 
Consequently, the methane and higher alcohols formed with zinc oxide-
chromium oxide catalysts are no longer major by-products. Formaldehyde and 
methyl formate form only in small, equilibrium amounts.

Ammonia and Methanol Synthesis  
433
Although dimethyl ether could be produced with an acid catalyst by a sim-
ple dehydration reaction, the alumina component of the catalyst has low acidity 
and less than 200 ppm ether is found in crude methanol. This is most probably 
due to the neutralizing effect of the basic zinc oxide. 
 
10.2.2.7 Low-pressure Methanol Reactor Types 
 
The first low-pressure methanol process was designed to produce 300-600 
tonnes per day of methanol, at about 50-bar pressure with a copper oxide-zinc 
oxide-alumina catalyst. This was the maximum size of plants being used at the 
time. By using a simple process design, based on a centrifugal compres-
sor/circulator, a novel quench converter with heat exchanger cooler and catch-
pot, the ICI process eliminated the costly high-pressure equipment and recipro-
cating compressors of the old process. The cost of making methanol was cut to 
 
The process was further optimized to operate at 100 bar pressure as demand 
for methanol increased and plants producing 1000 tonnes per day were devel-
oped. A more stable and efficient version of the original catalyst was also intro-
duced. As methanol demand continued to increase in the 1970s, other similar 
processes were developed using more energy-efficient designs. Apart from the 
first, quench cooled converters, tube cooled, radial flow and steam-raising con-
verters have all been used.  
Catalyst life and activity have also been improved. For various reasons the 
catalysts used in some of the later processes were based on copper oxide-zinc 
oxide-chromia catalysts.  
 
10.2.2.8 Catalyst Reduction 
 
The copper oxide component of low-pressure methanol catalysts must be re-
duced to copper metal, with a dilute stream of hydrogen in nitrogen, before use. 
Careful temperature control is essential during this procedure in which a large 
volume of water is evolved, depending on the copper content of the catalyst 
used. 
 Reducing gas contains up to 1% hydrogen at about 10-bar pressure and is 
circulated through the converter. The catalyst temperature is increased slowly 
and reduction should begin between 150°-160°C. The reduction of the catalyst is 
extremely exothermic and the progress of the reduction can be monitored by 
observation of a high-temperature zone passing down the bed as reduction pro-
ceeds. To prevent damage to the catalyst the inlet temperature is restricted to 
180°C with a maximum bed temperature of 230°C. If necessary, the maximum 
temperature can be controlled by changes to the hydrogen concentration as the 
hot spot passes down the catalyst bed. After condensing water from the outlet 
gas, the nitrogen is simply re-circulated after the addition of more hydrogen. 
51
about 25-30% at that current level of the time.
434 
 Chapter 10 
 
Any carbon dioxide, formed from the decomposition of residual carbonate in the 
catalyst, can be purged from the system if the concentration exceeds 2-3%. 
When the peak catalyst temperature reaches the bottom of the reactor, the 
inlet temperature can be increased to 220°–240°C and the hydrogen concentra-
tion to 10-20%. It can take about two to five days to reduce the 100–200 tonnes 
 The catalyst is most stable at low temperatures, and the purity of the 
product methanol decreases as the temperature of the converter is increased. For 
these reasons, the process is usually operated at the lowest possible temperature 
and pressure, consistent with achieving the design production rate. As the cata-
lyst becomes deactivated, it usually becomes necessary to increase the reaction 
temperature to maintain production capacity. The inlet temperature to the bed is 
usually about 220ºC in the initial stages, gradually increasing to 250ºC over a 
three to five year period. 
 
10.2.3 Novel Catalysts 
 
The possible use of palladium as a potential catalyst for the synthesis of metha-
nol received much of attention during the 1980s.56,57,58 These catalysts were nev-
er commercialised because the rate of reaction was relatively low, a significant 
amount of methane was always produced and the high cost of palladium made 
this approach too unattractive. 
 A much more radical approach was first proposed by Baglin and co-
workers,  who showed that careful oxidation of a range of copper/thorium in-
termetallic compounds gave rise to a new generation of extremely active cata-
lysts. Thorium, however, is weakly radio-active and would not be acceptable for 
large scale use on safety grounds. A similar range of catalysts based on interme-
tallic compounds derived from copper and rare earth elements was then devel-
oped by workers from ICI, who also discovered that the pure rare earth metal 
could be substituted by the much cheaper mixed alloy, Mischmetal, with no loss 
in activity. Addition of a little aluminium metal to the molten cop-
per/Mischmetal mixture improved the stability of the catalyst towards deactiva-
tion.  Methanol could be prepared over this generation of catalyst at tempera-
tures as low as 70ºC and pressures in the range 5–10 bar. The mechanism of 
methanol synthesis over this catalyst is quite different to that of the conventional 
copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst. It was demonstrated by radioactive labelling 
experiments that the methanol was produced directly from carbon monoxide, 
rather than carbon dioxide, in strong contrast with the conventional catalyst.  
Indeed, carbon dioxide was even shown to be a poison for this catalyst. It is be-
lieved that the active component of this catalyst is extremely small particles of 
copper metal, perhaps even in the atomic state, supported on an oxide matrix, on 
the basis of in situ x-ray diffraction analysis of the evolution of the catalyst from 
the intermetallic precursor.  This approach has not been commercialised at the

present time. The mains reasons were that poisoning by carbon dioxide and wa-
ter, meant that purification of the synthesis gas was very difficult and costly. 
Furthermore, the catalyst expanded in volume greatly during the in situ activa-
tion procedure, and this led to poor gas distribution through the converter. These 
problems have yet to be overcome.

ENVIRONMENTAL CATALYSTS 
 
 
 
 
The effects of atmospheric pollution from the combustion of fossil fuel have 
been recognized for many years. Acid rain from industrial areas of Europe and 
North America devastated forests. The pea-souper fogs in Donora, Pennsylva-
nia, London, UK and Belgium caused by emissions from power plants, steel-
works and metal smelters as well as domestic coal fires affected public health 
and led to thousands of deaths. All this, together with the photochemical smogs 
in Los Angeles, California, brought a growing demand for environmental protec-
tion.1 Early measures were almost all restricted to imposing limits on particulate 
emission and in the UK, the first Clean Air Act of 1956 resulted in the introduc-
tion of smokeless zones. Since then further legislation has led to the develop-
ment of catalytic processes that also reduce the concentration of nitrogen oxides, 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the various exhaust emissions to speci-
fied levels. 
Legislation was passed in the 1970s to limit the release of sulfur and nitro-
gen oxides from power plants in Japan and later in Germany. This led to the 
investigation of new catalytic processes. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 
was developed to enable power companies to reduce NOX emissions from coal 
and oil based power plants. Since then another procedure has been developed to 
remove NOX from the gaseous effluent produced by several other combustion 
and chemical processes. 
The Clean Air Act, introduced by the US Government during 1970, set spe-
cific targets for the control of emissions from automobiles to be achieved by 
1975. Catalytic converters are now fitted to automobiles in many parts of the 
world to remove nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in accord-

ance with local regulations. An additional environmental benefit from the use of 
catalytic converters has been the need to stop the addition of tetraethyl lead to 
gasoline. Tetraethyl lead was used originally to increase the octane rating of the 
gasoline, but lead is a powerful catalyst poison, and would cause a rapid deacti-
vation of the catalytic converter. This led to a need for major changes to be 
made to the composition of the US gasoline pool and new Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) regulations covering the reformulated gasoline were de-
veloped. The use of low-boiling, high-octane hydrocarbons and toxic aromatic 
components which may be released to the atmosphere is now restricted. 
A third major group of emissions controlled by environmental legislation 
comprises volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from all industrial and refinery 
effluents. The US Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 called for the reduction in 
the concentration of no fewer than 188 toxic chemical air pollutants before 
2000. Many of these chemicals are VOCs and significant reductions have been 
achieved by the introduction of a range of new catalytic oxidation processes. 
The magnitude of the problems involved in environmental control and the po-
tential demand for catalysts is demonstrated by Table 11.1 that shows the esti-
mated volume of some effluents in the USA during 1995.2 
Reports show that about 1.27 million tons of major chemicals were released 
in the US during 1993, some of which are listed in Table 11.2.3 Sulfuric acid 
made up about 73,000 tons of this total. During 1999 up to 22 million tons of 
sulfur was recovered from crude oil fractions and hydrocarbon gases by the cata-
lytic Claus Process.4 Although sulfur from power plant emissions has usually 
been removed chemically as gypsum, it can be converted to useful sulfuric acid 
by a modified form of the contact process.5

The catalytic processes used for environmental protection demand an enor-
mous capital investment but are relatively uncomplicated and more efficient 
than physical procedures. Demands imposed by environmental legislation have 
created a significant and rapidly expanding sector of the worldwide catalyst 
business. 
11.1 STATIONARY SOURCES 
High temperature combustion of coal and oil to provide heat and generate elec-
tricity resulted in huge volumes of nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide and 
carbon oxides being vented to the atmosphere. The most widely used fixed, or 
stationary, sources which produce nitrogen oxides are steam generating boilers, 
combustion turbines, process heaters, waste incinerators and reciprocating en-
gines. A number of chemical processes such as nitric acid, adipic acid, caprolac-
tam and acrylonitrile also produce effluents containing large volumes of nitro-
gen oxides. 
It is now generally necessary to treat the flue or exhaust gases from new sta-
tionary sources to remove NOX to a statutory level by the most convenient and 
economic procedure available (Figure 11.1). This usually requires a reduction 
process using added ammonia. Although some power plants have been retrofit-
ted with SCR equipment, many older installations have not been covered by the 
legislation. This has been described as being ‘grandfathered’ but, as a typical 
power plant has a life of at least 30-40 years, means that considerable NOX 
would still release continue for several years.

Coal and fuel oil can contain up to 5 wt% sulfur and during combustion 
most is converted to gaseous sulfur oxides. This amounts to about 1800 volume 
ppm sulfur dioxide in flue gas for 2.5 wt% sulfur in coal. Up to 95% of the sul-
fur in the flue gas can be removed by scrubbing with an aqueous slurry of lime-
stone to produce calcium sulphate, or gypsum. This procedure, however, re-
quired facilities for the disposal of the large amount of gypsum thus produced. 
Lower sulfur dioxide emissions can be obtained where possible by using low 
sulfur fuel. Alternatively, a mini sulfuric acid unit may now be installed to re-
cover several tonnes of acid per day from a single power plant unit.5 
Nitrogen oxides are formed at the high boiler temperatures, which can ex-
ceed 1500°C, from either the nitrogen compounds present in the fuel or by the 
direct oxidation of elemental nitrogen in air as shown in Table 11.3.6 The NOX 
content of flue gas in modern power plants is usually in the range 800–1800 
ppm as shown in Table 11.4.7

This can be controlled to a certain extent by the use of low nitrogen fuels or 
by modifying the combustion conditions. Low excess air addition, flue gas re-
circulation, low NOX burners or water/steam injection can provide 50-60% re-
ductions in NOX concentration. The scale of the operation is enormous and a 
typical US power plant burning 9500 tons of selected coal per day will have to 
remove about 135,000 tons of sulfur dioxide (95% conversion) and 45,000 tons 
of NOX per year. During 2000 about 50% of US power was generated from coal 
but by 2020 60% is expected to come from natural gas.8 
 
11.1.1 Selective Catalytic Reduction 
 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides with ammonia using 
specially developed catalysts was investigated in Japan from 1974 and then in-
troduced commercially from about 1980.9 It is now the most important process 
for removing nitrogen oxides (NOX) from the effluent gas of power plants and 
many other stationary sources. German power plants installed SCR units based 
on Japanese licenses from about 1984 following the introduction of legislation 
limiting the NOX content of effluent gases in 1983.10

Japanese power plants generally used low sulfur coal with dry fired boilers 
and accepted relatively low NOX conversion with the SCR catalysts. This also 
limited the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide and avoided 
excessive deposition of sulfates in downstream equipment. German power 
plants, with higher sulfur coals and slagging boilers, had difficulties resulting 
from high sulfur dioxide conversion to sulfur trioxide as well as catalyst poison-
ing from volatile arsenic oxides. These problems were gradually overcome 
through catalyst development and process modifications that included NOX 
removal following sulfur oxide removal. 
In the SCR process, NOX impurities are reduced with added ammonia in 
the presence of some residual oxygen from the furnace. The main NOX reduc-
tion reactions are shown in Table 11.5 together with some of the undesirable 
oxidation reactions, which can both produce sulfur trioxide and waste some of 
the added ammonia. Between 0.6–0.9 moles of ammonia per mole of NOX are 
added to limit the ammonia slip to downstream equipment where it would de-
posit as sulfates. NOX conversion is therefore limited to between 60-90%. At 
low NOX levels, there is little conversion to n
itrous oxide. Nitrous oxide 
formation is also inhibited by water. Gas leaving the boiler is usually at a tem-
perature in the range 300–430°C and contains dust. Dust is removed in an elec-
trostatic precipitator with little heat loss before sulfur dioxide is removed as 
gypsum by reaction with lime. Alternatively, sulfur dioxide can also be convert-
ed to sulfuric acid.5 The effluent gas is then vented to atmosphere. In the first 
power plants to be retrofitted with SCR units there were three possible locations 
for the catalyst bed: 
• At the boiler exit. In this position the temperature was suitable for the 
NOX reaction and allowed some conversion of sulfur dioxide to trioxide. 
Dust in the gas stream led to catalyst problems. 
• Following the electrostatic precipitator. The gas temperature was still 
high enough for both NOX removal and some sulfur dioxide oxidation. 
Dust problems were, however, avoided. 
• At the tail end following flue gas desulfurization. Dust problems and sul-
fur dioxide oxidation were avoided but the gas had to be reheated for the 
catalytic NOX reduction to be effective.

In the first processes, the choice was to use the catalyst in the most conven-
ient high dust location at the boiler exit where dust blocked the catalyst bed and 
eroded the catalyst surface in a relatively short period of time. This led Japanese 
operators to prefer the low dust location after the electrostatic precipitator. Ger-
man operators, however, decided to remove NOX after the sulfur dioxide re-
moval stage despite the need for heat exchange to reheat the gas when using 
typical catalysts. 
From 1980, a variety of catalyst shapes and compositions was developed to 
overcome operating problems and provide better catalyst selectivity. Following 
the US Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, it became necessary to consider 
SCR flue gas treatment from some coal based plants and to install suitable NOX 
removal procedures with new boilers, turbines and furnaces. 
 
11.1.2 Selective Catalytic Reduction Catalysts 
 
The most important reactions taking place over SCR catalysts are shown in Ta-
ble 11.5. In power plants using coal or hydrocarbon fuels there is typically a 
larger excess of nitric monoxide compared with nitrogen dioxide (~19:1) than 
in, say, nitric acid plant tail gas (~1:1). A number of catalysts have been intro-
duced (Figure 11.2) that are able to operate in the available temperature range 
from about 200°–430°C. The development, preparation and structure of the cata-
446   
Chapter 11 
lysts, the supports used and operating performance are described in several re-
views.11 
 
11.1.2.1 Catalyst Composition 
 
SCR catalysts are prepared from vanadium pentoxide promoted with either mo-
lybdenum trioxide or tungsten trioxide and supported on the anatase form of 
titanium dioxide. The kinetics of the reaction are diffusion limited, and conse-
quently, a thin layer of catalyst is usually deposited on a suitable high geometric 
area framework or honeycomb. When the flue gas has high dust content, at the 
boiler outlet, the honeycomb is formed from thin, notched, metal plates. These 
can be stacked as layers in modules that provide appropriate channel openings in 
the reactor. Alternatively, an extruded ceramic honeycomb with smaller chan-
nels and a higher surface area has been used when the gas has low dust content, 
after having passed through the electrostatic precipitator or desulfurization unit. 
Small honeycomb blocks are stacked together and loaded as beds in the reactor. 
Details of catalyst composition and dimensions, together with operating condi-
tions, are summarized in Table 11.6.10 
Catalysts based on zeolites have also been used successfully to remove NOX 
from the emissions of large and small-scale stationary sources. The zeolite can 
be extruded directly as a monolith or applied as a washcoat on preformed cordi-
erite  supports.  The  use  of  several zeolites—including  wide-pore mor-
denite—for this reaction has been patented.12 Up to 95% NOX conversion can 
be achieved with mordenite, with no promoters, and some zeolites are stable at 
temperatures up to 600°C. Long catalyst lives have been achieved in retrofitted 
coal based SCR units with low sulfur trioxide formation and good poisons re-
sistance. Spent zeolite catalysts can be disposed of in approved landfill sites 
because they have negligible heavy-metal content.12 
Promoted vanadium pentoxide/titania and zeolite based catalysts have been 
used to reduce NOX emissions at low temperature from nitric acid plants, gas 
turbines, industrial heaters, incinerators and boilers.13

11.1.2.2 Catalyst Operation 
 
Most catalysts supported on titanium dioxide reach an optimum NOX reduction 
temperature that depends on the catalyst composition and the treated gas. Activi-
ty then declines as the secondary reactions compete for the ammonia reductant 
and sulfur dioxide oxidation becomes excessive. Typical operation is in the 
range 300°–425°C although zeolite catalysts operate from 300°–600°C.12,13 
Catalysts may therefore be designed for use in specific duties. For power 
plant, the design must balance the reaction rates of NOX reduction and sulfur 
dioxide oxidation in the restricted range of temperature of flue gas leaving the 
boiler, or at the dust and sulfur dioxide removal stages. A low activity catalyst 
that reaches maximum NOX reduction between, say 380°–400°C, can be more 
efficient than a catalyst that is more active between 300°–350°C because, over-
all, it produces less sulfur trioxide at the fixed operating temperature.14 
Vanadium pentoxide/titania catalysts, promoted with molybdenum trioxide 
or tungsten trioxide, have lower sulfur dioxide oxidation activity under power 
plant conditions than unpromoted catalysts. However, while catalysts containing 
tungsten trioxide are initially more active, any arsenic oxides in flue gas more 
easily poison them than similar catalysts containing molybdenum trioxide. Ar-
senic is a typical impurity in coal. Flue gas from slagging boilers contains up to 
twenty times more than flue gas from dry ash boilers. Catalysts promoted with 
molybdenum trioxide have been more widely used in Europe for this reason. 
The vanadium pentoxide content of NOX reduction catalysts is probably less 
than 1 wt% which maximizes the rate of nitrogen oxide reduction while limiting 
the rate of sulfur dioxide oxidation. The total oxide content including promoter 
would be less than 10 wt%.15 
 
11.1.2.3 Reaction Mechanism 
 
Selective Catalytic Reduction catalysts are similar to the vanadium pentoxide-
anatase catalysts introduced by BASF and von Hayden in the 1960s for the oxi-
dation of methyl groups in ortho-xylene. They were also coated onto cordierite 
supports.15 Vanadium pentoxide reacts with surface hydroxyl groups on the tita-
nia to form active surface sites. In the case of oxidation catalysts, the mono-
vanadyl species are active. However, for NOX reduction, at least two vanadyl 
groups, linked by an oxygen atom, form the selective site. These sites must be 
maximized.15 
When the vanadium content of the catalyst is low, the monovanadyl surface 
species predominates. At a concentration around 5%, the monovanadyl species 
begin to polymerize, forming V-O-V bridges by dehydration mechanism, and at 
concentrations above about 10%, crystalline vanadium pentoxide is deposited. 
Preparation of the necessary active sites for maximum activity and selectivity 
has been achieved by promoting the catalyst with an excess of molybdenum 
448   
Chapter 11 
trioxide or tungsten trioxide. Both oxides are known to form a wide range of 
mixed oxides with vanadium pentoxide and can presumable spread active sites 
over the catalyst surface.15 
The reaction is through to proceed via the following mechanism. Ammonia 
is adsorbed on one of the V=O groups of an active site and then reacts with ni-
tric oxide: 
 
  
NH3 + NO + V=O  →  N2 + H2O + V–OH 
(11.1) 
 
The V-OH group is then reoxidized by lattice or molecular oxygen leaving the 
active site in its original state: 
 
  
2 V−OH + O  →  2 V=O + H2O 
(11.2) 
 
It has been suggested that the V=O and V–OH groups are in equilibrium on 
the catalyst surface and that the hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyl groups are mo-
bile.15 It is possible that at low vanadia loading on unpromoted titania, with no 
promoter, that part of the vanadium is reduced to low activity V4+ and there is a 
lower proportion of Bronsted acid sites.15 The presence of a promoter may avoid 
this and provide the active catalyst. Mixed oxides equivalent to the compound 
V9Mo6O40 (β-bronze, see Table 4.7), containing no V2O5 also undergo a phase 
change to V6Mo4O25, with some reduction of V5 to V4+, in the presence of arse-
nic oxide.15 
The following substances are known to poison the reaction:  
• Arsenic oxide which reduces the vanadium component of the active sites. 
• Alkalis which neutralize the acid sites. 
• Calcium sulfate or silica deposition on the catalyst surface , which covers 
the active sites. 
 
11.1.2.4 Removal of Sulfur Dioxide as Sulfuric Acid 
 
The SNOX process developed by Haldor Topsøe avoids problems associated 
with undesirable sulfur dioxide oxidation in the SCR process.5 Sulfur dioxide is 
removed from the flue gas in a small contact process unit after the nitrogen ox-
ides have been removed by the usual SCR procedure. Nitrogen oxide conversion 
is as high as 95% and sulfur oxides are almost completely recovered as com-
mercially useful sulfuric acid. Apart from the environmental benefits, such a 
design allows the use of higher sulfur content coals in power generation and 
avoids the need for gypsum disposal. 
Conventional SCR and sulfuric acid catalysts are used. Nitrogen oxides are 
removed with maximum conversion at about 390°C, following dust removal, 
with a typical promoted vanadium pentoxide/titania catalyst. Sulfur dioxide is

then converted to sulfuric acid, using a vanadium pentoxide/kieselguhr catalyst, 
by the wet gas sulfuric acid process.17 Residual ammonia is also removed during 
the oxidation. 
This process was first employed in 1991 in a 300 MW coal-based power 
plant in Denmark. It produced about 5 tonne h-1 of sulfuric acid from a total gas 
flow of up to 900,000 m3/hr at 100% load using 0.38 tonnes per hour of ammo-
nia for the SCR reaction.5 
 
11.1.3 Gas Turbine Exhausts 
 
Up to one million tonnes of NOX emissions per year were produced by gas tur-
bines fired with natural gas and distillates in 1992/3.18 Typical volumes of NOX 
in exhaust gases for different operating conditions involving a number of me-
chanical or catalytic processes are shown in Table 11.4. In future, to cope with 
the rapid growth of power generation, the cheaper and cleaner gas turbines will 
replace coal-fired boilers as a major source of energy.8 At the same time, more 
stringent regulations will probably limit NOX emissions to less than 5 ppm. 
 
11.1.3.1 
Low Temperature Vanadium Pentoxide Catalysts 
 
It has been convenient to use a low temperature selective catalytic reduction 
catalyst operating in the range 160°–190°C after the heat recovery steam genera-
tor in a gas turbine. A promoted vanadium pentoxide catalyst supported on tita-
nia extrudates has been used in these duties, and is stable between 160°–360°C, 
with no sintering.19 Nitrogen oxides are reduced by up to 95% and turbines of up 
to 20MW capacity have been retrofitted. If sulfur dioxide is present in the ex-
haust gas then a small conversion to sulfur trioxide may occur depending on the 
temperature. 
 
11.1.3.2 Catalytic Combustion Processes 
 
Catalytic combustion processes are now being developed in which the high tem-
perature thermal formation of NOX is avoided by operating at a lower tempera-
ture. This could avoid the current use of SCR processes to remove thermally 
generated NOX from the effluent of conventional gas turbines. Reactions that 
generate NOX during the typical homogeneous combustion hydrocarbons with 
air take place at temperatures as high as 1500°C and are listed in Table 11.3. 
The NOX concentration depends on the maximum temperature and contact time. 
While water/steam injection or low fuel/air ratios do improve performance they 
increase operating costs or affect reliability. 
Catalytic combustion can produce a stable surface flame at low fuel/air ratio 
and temperatures as low as 1300°C, and this avoids the formation of thermal 
NOX. Operating costs are also significantly lower.20 Compression up to an oper-
450   
Chapter 11 
ating level of 12–16 bar can increase the gas temperature to 350°–410°C. This 
may not be high enough to initiate catalytic combustion and a gas burner may be 
reach an outlet temperature of up to 1300°C in modern turbines so a very stable 
catalyst has to be used. Typical space velocities in the small turbine combustion 
chamber are up to 300,000 h-1 which demands a high catalyst activity. A prob-
lem during operation, however, is that both thermal and catalytic combustion 
occur at temperatures exceeding 1000°C. 
So far, it has not been possible to develop a thermally stable catalyst that 
can operate at temperatures of up to 1300°C when burning the fuel/air mixture 
in an economic combustor design. This has led to several modified catalytic 
procedures. Two-stage burning procedures have been developed. One burns 
only part of the fuel in the first catalytic stage. This limits the catalyst tempera-
ture to less than 1000°C and forms less than 3 ppm NOX. Remaining fuel is 
added to the second stage and good mixing with the residual air is essential to 
achieve a maximum temperature below 1300°C and avoid temperature hot spots 
that can then give rise to additional NOX.21 
In a second process, air is added in two stages. A high fuel ratio in the first 
stage limits the temperature rise in the catalyst and produces a carbon monox-
ide/hydrogen mixture with 2–14 ppm NOX. Once again, good mixing of fuel 
with the remaining air is needed in the second thermal stage to avoid the for-
mation of more NOX.22 
with three sections. The first section contains an active palladium oxide catalyst 
that can operate up to about 800°C before being reduced to palladium metal 
which is less active. The palladium oxide catalyst is regenerated by reoxidation 
of the metal as temperature falls. A more stable catalyst in the second section 
continues the catalytic combustion. In the third section, combustion is completed 
by thermal reaction and the gas temperature increases to 1300°–1400°C. Over-
all, less than 1 ppm NOX is formed. Palladium oxide is supported on a monolith 
coated with temperature resistant barium hexaaluminate.23 
 
11.1.4 Nitric Acid Plant Exhaust Gas 
 
Nitrogen oxides are removed from the exhaust gas of nitric acid plants by vari-
ous procedures. A typical exhaust gas contains about 4000 ppm NOX 
(NO:NO2 = 1) with 3% oxygen and the balance nitrogen. Non-selective removal 
is possible using a conventional supported palladium catalyst, with added hy-
drogen, carbon monoxide or a hydrocarbon, at a temperature in the range 200°–
400°C. Both oxygen and NOX are removed with a temperature rise depending 
on the oxygen content.24 
Investigations to develop base metal catalysts have led to the use of selec-
tive catalytic reduction processes with supported vanadium pentoxide catalysts 
In a more interesting process, all of the fuel/air mixture is added to a combustor 
required to trigger the reaction. Catalytic combustion units must be designed to

and ammonia as the reductant. More than 90% NOX conversion can be 
achieved, with acceptable levels of ammonia in effluent, by operating at temper-
atures in the range 170°–250°C and a space velocity up to 40,000 h-1. 
Vanadium pentoxide catalysts, similar to those used to remove nitrogen ox-
ides from gas turbine effluent, have also been used to treat the effluents from a 
nitric acid plant.25 The catalyst is based on extruded titania, impregnated with 
vanadium pentoxide and any promoters, or cordierite monoliths covered with a 
washcoat of the active material. 
An active catalyst based on an extruded large-pore mordenite support has 
also been used.12 
 
11.1.5 Ion-exchanged ZSM-5 Zeolites 
 
Direct decomposition of nitric oxide could be more attractive than selective 
catalytic reduction but, although the reaction is thermodynamically favourable 
up to 1000°C, this has not so far been achieved. It is possible, however, that cat-
alysts may be developed in the future to make the process attractive at commer-
cial temperatures. Nitrogen oxides decompose in the ten membered rings of the 
zeolite structure where metal has been exchanged.
zeolite has a stable activity in the range 400°-
when using ammonia as reductant, particularly
metal such as magnesium.26 The presence of 
reduce activity. 
Nitric oxide can be reduced by low molecular weight hydrocarbons in the 
presence of oxygen. This avoids the use of ammonia and, potentially, makes the 
metal exchanged ZSM-5 suitable for NOX removal from some exhaust emis-
sions. Palladium exchanged ZSM-5 was found to be more active than the copper 
exchanged catalysts, at significantly lower temperature.26 
So far, the practical problems of commercial operation and the effects of 
poisons limit the efficiency of metal exchanged ZSM-5 catalysts. No large-scale 
operations have been reported for the treatment of effluents from either station-
ary or mobile sources. 
In general, the use of most zeolites has been limited both by the significant-
ly higher costs of these materials and by problems with poisons and deactiva-
tion. The efficiency and longer life of cheaper alternatives are still more attrac-
tive. As the energy business changes from coal to natural gas as the preferred 
source of energy during the next 10-20 years, retrofits and any changes to the 
types of catalysts used will be delayed.

11.2  MOBILE SOURCES 
The rapid increase in the use of automobiles throughout the world has generated 
a high proportion of the pollution responsible for low level ozone and smog 
formation since the 1950s. The significance of ozone in photochemical smog 
was discovered following work by Arie J Haagen Smit on the components of 
pineapple fragrance in 1952! He realized that the ozone concentration during his 
experiments was higher on foggy days than on clear days.27 The paper on ‘The 
Chemistry and Physics of Los Angeles Smog’ described the importance of sun-
light in smog formation.28 It has been reported that Los Angeles, with mountains 
on three sides, has up to 320 days per year with inversion conditions. 
The term inversion in this context refers to the atmospheric condition 
whereby there is an increase in temperature with altitude, in contrast with the 
norm, where there would be a decrease in temperature with altitude. Such an 
inversion can lead to pollution and smog being trapped close to the ground. It is 
believed that the exhaust emissions from automobiles contribute strongly to the 
genesis of this type of inversion. 
The scale of the problem led to the introduction of legislation. In 1966 the 
California state government specified state limits for hydrocarbon and carbon 
monoxide emissions from automobiles. These were followed, in 1970, by the 
US Federal Clean Air Act. Since then the emission limits from automobiles have 
become increasingly rigorous, and a zero emission vehicle limit (ZEVL) in 1998 
requiring that, in certain cases, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen 
oxides be completely removed was imposed in California. This must obviously 
refer to electric powered vehicles but does indicate how tight the limits may 
become in future. 
possible by the use of automobile emission control catalysts.29 These were first 
used in the US during 1975 and in Europe from 1993. As a result of continuous 
improvement to design and manufacture, the catalysts have been able to con-
form with the increasing severity of the regulations. 
 
11.2.1 Automobile Emission Control 
 
Measures to control the level of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in automo-
bile exhaust emissions began during the 1960s with modifications to the fuel 
management system. At the same time, base metal oxidation catalysts were test-
ed and were found to be easily poisoned by other impurities. From 1975–77 
precious metal catalysts containing platinum and palladium,30 together with bet-
ter fuel management, were found to be the essential to remove carbon monoxide 
and hydrocarbons from the exhaust. These early catalysts became more success-
ful as the levels of lead additives in gasoline were first decreased and then com- 
The trends in the automobile emission standards for the USA and Europe since 
1966 are given in Table 11.7. Compliance with the standards set has been made

pletely removed. There was no NOX regulation during that period but, where 
necessary, some NOX reduction was made possible by recycling exhaust gases. 
More stringent engine control and efficient catalysts were demanded from 
1977 when legislation calling for NOX removal was also introduced. Nitrogen 
oxides were difficult to remove in conjunction with the other pollutants, particu-
larly in the presence of oxygen. This led to strict control of the air/fuel ratio 
(A/F) in the engine by the use of oxygen sensors in the exhaust and the introduc-
tion of efficient three-way catalysts incorporating rhodium.31 
In simple terms, the two-way catalyst is solely an oxidation catalyst, which 
is used to convert carbon monoxide and residual hydrocarbons to carbon diox-
ide. The three-way catalyst also provides a capability for reduction, which is 
required for the removal of nitrogen oxides. 
The air/fuel ratio, based on the mass of air and fuel used in an engine, has a 
significant effect on the proportion of the undesirable impurities in exhaust gas 
as shown in Table 11.8. At the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of about 14.7 there is 
just enough air for complete hydrocarbon combustion. With less air, that is with 
rich. 
Under rich conditions, the exhaust will contain more reducing impurities such as 
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. With an excess of air, or a ‘lean’ mixture, 
the exhaust will contain more oxidizing impurities such as oxygen and less ni-
trogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Exhaust gas compositions are related to the 
lambda (λ) value which is defined as the ratio of the actual and stoichiometric 
value of the A/F ratio. This variable ratio does not require knowledge of the 
gasoline composition.

Many chemical reactions can take place in the engine effluent to remove 
undesirable impurities and some of these are shown in Table 11.9. Reactions A-
C can all take place in a catalytic converter although, if possible, reactions C-D 
should be avoided. 
The basic catalytic systems that have been used to control emissions are: 
• From 1977, closed loops with an oxygen sensor have been used to control 
the air/fuel ratio and to optimize conversion of carbon monoxide, hydro-
carbons and NOX with a three-way catalyst system. Before the develop-
ment of fuel management systems the lower conversions needed to meet 
legislation could be achieved with a variable air/fuel ratio. 
• Two catalytic converters may be used with the engine operating in a rich 
mode. The first catalyst reduces nitrogen oxides in an oxygen deficient 
exhaust. Oxygen can then be added to the exhaust to remove carbon 
monoxide and hydrocarbons with an oxidation catalyst in the second con-
tainer. 
• If extra oxygen is added before treating a rich exhaust mixture in a cata-
lytic converter only carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are removed. 
• Lean operating engines may operate with an air/fuel ratio as high as 26  
(λ ~ 1.8) which produces low nitrogen oxide concentrations in the efflu-
ent. This demands the use of higher activity, oxidation catalysts because 
of the lower exhaust gas temperature. 
Not all of these applications can meet the current strict emission legislation. 
The autocatalyst operates under conditions that are constantly changing. 
Cold starts may be required several times a day and even on a motorway, auto-
mobiles are regularly accelerating and braking. This will influence the air/fuel 
ratio and engine temperature. These factors all have an effect on catalyst per-
formance. A typical operating cycle is, therefore: 
• Following ignition, the temperature increases from ambient to 600°C. 
Catalyst becomes active, or lights off, in the temperature range 250°–
300°C. 
• Conversion then increases rapidly up to ~600°C and conversion reaches 
95–100%. Temperatures reach 900°C under full load.

• Air/fuel ratio is usually stoichiometric at about 14.7. 
• Under fuel rich conditions NOX conversion is enhanced while under fuel 
lean conditions there is more carbon monoxide/hydrocarbon conversion. 
There is normally some oscillation around the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio 
that is adjusted by the feedback system to control air addition to the engine. 
in the engine are richer and when 
decelerating conditions are leaner. Operation at the stoichiometric level provides 
sufficient carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to reduce the NOX concentration. 
 
11.2.2 Automobile Emission Control Catalysts 
 
The choice of catalyst used is critical in removing the three major impurities and 
it must be operated under conditions that are effective for the oxidation of car-
bon monoxide and hydrocarbons and the reduction of the nitrogen oxides. This 
demanding operation was necessary from about 1980 when more comprehensive 
effluent control legislation was introduced in the US. By 1980, the original bead 
catalysts were being replaced by the more efficient extruded ceramic honey-
combs or monoliths, which were impregnated with the active catalyst. Honey-
combs have the advantage of a reduction in pressure drop through the catalyst 
bed, improved gas distribution, and a reduction in the size and weight of the 
equipment used. Metal monoliths were also developed, although these were not 
as widely used as ceramics. Platinum group metals are the most efficient and 
active catalysts available and are more resistant to poison than base metals.

11.2.2.1 Bead Catalysts 
 
Bead catalysts were based on typical supports such as ,  or  alumina with 
surface areas of about 100 m2/g. Alumina was easily impregnated with the plati-
1000–1100°C before the phase change to  alumina took place. Alumina can 
be stabilized to a limited extent by the addition of other refractory oxides but 
will still sinter at high temperature. 
A disadvantage of the bead catalysts, when used in small volume reactors, 
is the need to select an appropriate size to compromise between an acceptable 
pressure drop through the bed and a satisfactory rate of gas mixing. A complex 
design of the catalyst container is also required, to provide for a uniform gas 
flow and to avoid disintegration of the catalyst by physical shock as the vehicle 
passes over uneven ground. They were, however, easily produced and withstood 
Platinum group metals are best adsorbed onto the surface of alumina parti-
cles during impregnation, which limits the amount of metal used and minimizes 
costs. 
Typical bead properties were in the ranges: 
• Diameter 
0.3–0.4 cm 
• Pore volume 
0.5–1.0 cm /g 
• Bulk density 
0.43– 0.67 kg/liter 
 
11.2.2.2 Monolith Catalysts 
 
The production of honeycomb monolith catalysts  is relatively more complicated 
than the formation of bead catalysts. It requires several stages: 
• Extrusion of the cordierite monolith followed by firing at a high tempera-
ture. 
• Application of an alumina washcoat to the honeycomb surface again fol-
lowed by firing at an appropriate temperature. 
• Impregnation of the platinum group metals, together with other metal ox-
ide promoters, onto the wash coat. 
The most common support is a cylinder of cordierite (2MgO.2Al2O3.5SiO2), 
extruded as a honeycomb, and covered with a washcoat of γ-, θ- and δ- alumina 
with a surface area of about 100 m2g-1. The components all have a similar ther-
mal coefficient of expansion, and hence the composite is most able to withstand 
the heating and cooling cycles without disintegrating during use. Cordierite also 
has a bulk porosity in the range 20–40 %vol, mainly as macropores, so that good 
wash coat adhesion is achieved and the overall bulk density is low. Typical cor- 
num and palladium and the resulting catalysts were stable at temperatures up to 
the significant thermal shock when used in an automobile exhaust. Under steady 
conditions, beads were stable for long periods.

dierite honeycombs contain 400–600 channels per square inch of the face area 
and typical properties are given in Table 11.10.32 
Metallic monoliths are very light and made up of alternating flat and corru-
gated foil plates about 0.05 mm thick in a cylindrical container. They present a 
large open area for gas to pass through the channels and have a high thermal 
conductivity. Metals are, however, non-porous and special alloys, containing 
 
iron, chromium, aluminum (Fecralite), must be pre-treated to provide a suitable 
oxide layer which bonds with the alumina washcoat. 
Ceramic or metal monoliths are packed into a stainless steel metal can with 
a ceramic or wire mesh mat as packing which acts as protection against mechan-
ical vibration as well as providing insulation. 
 
11.2.2.3 Washcoat Composition 
 
The surface of the honeycomb is covered by the alumina washcoat, which can 
be stabilized against sintering at high temperature by the addition of more re-
fractory materials such as barium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide or 
lanthanum oxide. A very thin surface layer of the washcoat, up to about 10-
30μm, is applied although the thickness increases to about 150μm at the corners 
of the square channels. 
The surface area of the washcoat can be varied within a range of 50–250 
m2/g of coating, depending on the platinum group metal loading and the stability 
required. The washcoat is applied as aqueous slurry that is then dried and cal-
cined to provide the appropriate crystalline form and surface area. Some oxides 
are added as stabilisers, to prevent phase changes at the higher temperatures 
experienced in the exhaust, while others may also be added to improve the per-
formance of the catalyst, as shown below:  
• Cerium oxide acts as an oxygen sink which can absorb oxygen during 
lean operation to assist in oxidation when it is later released during peri-
ods of rich operation. Ceria will also stabilize the distribution of platinum 
during operation and promote the water gas shift reaction to produce hy-
458   
Chapter 11 
drogen that improves the performance of the catalyst under rich condi-
tions. 
• Barium oxide has often been included in the washcoat because it can also 
absorb oxygen under lean conditions. The barium peroxide that formed 
also provides oxygen as it decomposes during rich operation. 
• Zirconia is added to stabilize the ceria and to ensure than oxygen remains 
available from the surface oxides even if the ceria surface has been sin-
tered at the high operating temperature of about 850°–900°C. Zirconia al-
so plays an essential role in the three-way catalyst formulation as the sup-
port for rhodium. 
Ceria and zirconia have been shown by electron microprobe spectroscopy to 
combine the preparation of the catalyst, forming a very thermally stable phase, 
and platinum group metals deposit preferentially on the alumina.33 The washcoat 
has often been applied and fired with more alumina before the platinum group 
metals are impregnated. Alternatively, the washcoat and metals can be applied at 
the same time. In either case, the conditions for the deposition can be adjusted to 
provide a variable surface layer of alumina and the oxides, which absorb trace 
poisons and protect the active metals. 
 
11.2.2.4 Platinum Group Metal Catalysts 
 
When automobile emission regulations were first introduced, only platinum and 
palladium catalysts were used for the oxidation of carbon monoxide and residual 
hydrocarbons. Both metals were active oxidation catalysts although palladium 
was more temperature resistant than platinum but was more readily poisoned by 
sulfur. Rhodium became an important part of the three-way autocatalysts be-
cause it had high activity for the reduction of nitric oxide. Three-way catalysts 
were used in all cars from 1981 because of US Federal regulations although they 
had been introduced by California for 1978 model cars. 
Although platinum and palladium have some activity for the reduction of 
NOX under stoichiometric conditions, the presence of oxygen in exhaust gas 
inhibits the conversion. Nitric oxide is, however, strongly adsorbed on the rho-
dium (III) surface to form nitrosyl groups.34 These are reduced by adsorbed car-
bon monoxide and the nitrogen produced is desorbed at temperatures between 
200°–300°C. Rhodium is less catalytically active than either platinum or palla-
dium for the oxidation of carbon monoxide, because the adsorption of carbon
Rhodium also has a relatively high water gas shift activity, does not sinter at high 
temperature and resists sulfur poisoning. 
Some modifications to the operation of the car engine were made to resolve 
early difficulties in the optimisation of the removal of all three pollutants from 
the exhaust emission. Different combinations of the three catalysts were used in 
monoxide by rhodium is inhibited by high concentrations of nitrogen atoms. 
 
Environmental Catalysts   
459 
The exact composition of the operating 
literature, as this type of information is kept confi-
typical ranges are as follows:32
 
• Oxidation catalyst: platinum/palladium ratio of ~5:2 with 1.5 g of metals 
per liter of monolith volume. 
• Three-way catalyst: platinum/rhodium ratio of 5:1 to 20:1 with 0.9–2.2 g 
of metal per liter of monolith volume. 
• Three-way catalyst (containing palladium): metal contents of about 0.9–
3.1 g Pt, 0–3.1 g Pd, and 0.15–0.5 g Rh per monolith. 
• Palladium light-off catalyst: with 1.8–10.6 g of metal per liter of monolith 
volume. 
• Three-way catalyst (all or most of the platinum replaced by palladium): 
platinum/palladium/rhodium ratio of 0–1:8–16:1 with 2–5.5 g of metal 
per liter of honeycomb volume. 
 
 The switch from platinum to palladium has been driven by the better 
availability and lower price of palladium, together with a higher level of com-
bustion of the hydrocarbons. The improved performance of palladium has arisen 
because the amount of sulfur and lead impurities in the gasoline has decreased. 
 
11.2.2.
Catalyst Poisons 
 
The performance of the catalyst is adversely affected by the presence of residual 
sulfur in the gasoline, and by tetraethyl lead, which used to be added to improve 
the octane rating of the gasoline. By the late 1990s, the use of lead additives had 
almost completely been discontinued in many parts of the world. Furthermore, 
the amount of sulfur in gasoline was also limited by environmental legislation. 
The sulfur components of gasoline, which were oxidised to sulfur dioxide in the 
engine and subsequently reduced to hydrogen sulfide in the exhaust, adversely 
affected the performance especially of palladium catalysts. Oil additives such as 
zinc dialkyl-dithiophosphates also have a poisoning effect on the catalyst due to 
the presence of zinc and the oxides of phosphorus in the exhaust gas. The total 
exposure of the catalyst to poisons35 during a typical lifetime of 100,000 miles is 
shown in Table 11.11. 
The addition of nickel oxide to a catalyst washcoat can minimize the for-
mation of hydrogen sulfide during lean operation by absorbing some of the sul-
fur dioxide from exhaust gas. Nickel oxide can, therefore, store the sulfur diox-
ide as sulfate under reducing conditions and then release the sulfur dioxide un-
der oxidizing conditions.

11.2.3 Platinum Metal Group Availability 
 
The platinum group metals are usually found as sulfides, arsenides or as the 
native metal, usually in conjunction with base metals. The concentration is 
almost always too low to justify mining for the precious metals alone, and the 
worldwide availability of the precious metal component tends to be determined 
by the demand for the other metal. For example, platinum is most commonly 
associated with nickel and copper sulfide deposits, and it is the extraction of the 
base metals from their ores that provides an economic route to the precious met-
al. In a typical operation in the US, 10 lbs copper can be extracted from a ton of 
 
 
ore, but the content of palladium is 0.000029 tr.oz and the platinum content is 
only 0.0000029 tr.oz. Significant quantities are only available in South Africa, 
Canada, Russia and the United States. 
 Spent honeycomb exhaust catalysts contain a relatively high concentra-
tion of the precious metal, and these can be recycled. It is certain that they will 
become an important and economic source of the metals as the use of automo-
biles continues to increase. About 15% platinum and 5% rhodium were recycled 
in 1990. The predicted demand for the metals to be used in autocatalysts, com-
pared with the potentially available supplies, is shown in Table 11.12.35 
 
11.2.4 
Catalyst Operation 
 
Three way auto-catalysts containing a high proportion of palladium were even-
tually preferred, because platinum was more expensive, potentially in short 
supply, and palladium is more active than platinum for hydrocarbon oxidation.
Early palladium catalysts were easily deactivated by the sulfur and phos-
phorous impurities in the gasoline but new engines operating at higher tempera-
ture limited the adverse effect of these poisons. It is now common practice to 
replace the platinum with palladium completely in some catalysts although the 
loading of palladium is usually higher.  
 Different catalysts or combinations of catalysts can be used as outlined in 
the basic principles:

• Palladium catalysts are very effective for the conversion of carbon mon-
oxide and hydrocarbon residues, but the conversion of NOx is low. 
• Catalysts based on platinum and rhodium give good NOx conversion, but 
an increased metal loading is required to give a satisfactory oxidation of 
the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon components. 
• Catalysts based on all three metals give an overall satisfactory perfor-
mance, but conversion of NOx is even higher when a binary plati-
num/rhodium catalyst is followed by a palladium catalyst. 
Detailed information is never released by the catalyst supplier, as it is very 
difficult to guarantee adequate protection of proprietary information. Metal load-
ings vary depending on the engine size and the required performance. The cata-
lyst monolith in a 1.8 liter car would have a volume of about 1.25 liters with 400 
channels per square inch, or 60 channels per square centimeter. Up to 300 grams 
of an alumina washcoat containing 30% ceria and about 1% precious metals 
would be used, corresponding to about 0.1wt% of metal in the monolith. Some 
monoliths contain about 600 channels per square inch or 90 channels per square 
centimeter. 
 In common with all catalysts, there is a temperature, often referred to as 
the “light-off” temperature, below which the reaction does not proceed. As the 
temperature is increased above the light-off temperature, the reaction then pro-
ceeds with increasing rate. In the case of automobile exhaust catalysts, the tem-
perature of the exhaust and the catalyst is too low for a period of about 30 se-
conds for the oxidation of exhaust hydrocarbon residues to take place. However, 
once the temperature reaches about 300ºC, the catalyst becomes very active and 
the required reactions then take place. The composition of a typical exhaust gas 
under different conditions is shown in Table 11.13.35 
Various modifications have been considered to decrease the time between
starting the engine and reducing emissions, as shown below:

• Move the catalyst closer to the engine. There is not much space to install 
a small catalyst bed in modern automobiles, and there are additional prob-
lems associated with the selection of a catalyst with sufficient thermal 
stability to operate at temperatures close to 1000ºC. Catalysts derived 
from palladium may have the required thermal properties, but this ap-
proach is not favoured by the industry.  
• Indirect electrical heating. This would certainly decrease the time before 
the catalyst became active, but the electrical load would be excessive, and 
the lifetime of the heater is likely to be too short to offer a viable solution. 
• Use of a hydrocarbon adsorption trap. This approach has the potential to 
store unburnt hydrocarbons until the catalyst is sufficiently hot to enable 
oxidation of the hydrocarbon. 
Compounds such as zeolites, perhaps containing a suitable metal promoter, 
can adsorb exhaust hydrocarbons that consist largely of olefin and aromatic 
compounds. The pore structure of many zeolites is broken down by the removal 
of alumina from the crystal lattice, particularly in the presence of steam at high 
temperatures. A practical solution to this problem would be to add a low alumi-
na zeolite to the washcoat, prior to impregnation onto the monolith, and then to 
add an oxidation catalyst derived from palladium. Much of the hydrocarbon 
would be contained by the zeolite at low temperature and then oxidized over the 
palladium catalyst when the temperature became sufficiently high, both to de-
sorb from the zeolite and to light off the catalyst. 
A more direct way to avoid hydrocarbon escape during the heat up period 
has been the development of a very short monolith with about 400 channels per 
square centimeter (2500 channels per square inch) followed by a conventional 
monolith. The high gas velocity in the small channels allows faster heat and 
mass transfer so that the catalyst heats more rapidly to reaction temperature. 
Light-off is reported to take place within fifteen seconds of starting the engine.35 
 The use of a distillation device heated by the engine has also been sug-
gested as a way of collecting some of the very lowest boiling fractions of gaso-
line. The low boiling fuel can be stored until the next cold start. The low-boiling 
components of gasoline are oxidised over the catalyst at a much lower tempera-
ture than the other higher-boiling components, and this approach36 can lead to a 
reduction of up to 50% of the normal emissions during a cold-start.

11.2.5 Nitrogen Oxide Removal in Lean-Burn Engines 
 
Lean-burn engines are more fuel-efficient when there is an excess of oxygen in 
the combustion gas and emit less carbon dioxide per mile travelled. Lean condi-
tions lead to lower levels of NOx in the exhaust gas, but the introduction of fu-
ture legislation on the NOx content of the exhaust will require that further reduc-
tion will have to be considered. NOx removal in the presence of excess oxygen is 
more difficult than removal under stoichiometric conditions because normally 
the NOx is reduced by some of the unburnt carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons 
in the exhaust. 
A partial solution to the NOX removal problem with lean-burn engines may 
be the use of a platinum/rhodium catalyst combined with a barium oxide trap 
that can absorb nitrogen dioxide as nitrate. The mechanism of the reaction is: 
• nitric oxide is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide on a platinum site; 
• the nitrogen dioxide forms barium nitrate on the trap before it can leave 
the catalytic converter; 
• alternating rich operation for a few seconds every minute or so, releases 
the nitrogen dioxide which can then be reduced by carbon monoxide or 
hydrocarbon at a rhodium site. 
The cycle then repeats during subsequent lean/rich operation. 
The main problem with the barium oxide approach is that sulfur dioxide 
competes with NOx for the basic sites, and is converted irreversibly to barium 
sulphate, which is quite inert. Thus, the active barium sites are quickly saturated, 
and the removal of NOx from the emission is severely restricted. The sulfur con-
tent of the gasoline would need to be much lower for this approach to provide a 
long-term solution to the NOx problem. There may also be problems associated 
with the thermal stability of the barium oxide traps during the many redox cy-
cles, which the catalyst would be expected to experience over the lifetime of an 
autocatalyst. 
 Other procedures have been suggested for the treatment of the exhaust 
from lean-burn engines. One possibility is the absorption of NOx on a suitable 
zeolite, followed by desorption and recycle of the NOx back to the engine, where 
it would be reduced by some of the fuel in the combustion chambers. The prob-
lem with this approach is that most zeolites suffer from dealumination in the 
presence of steam at high temperature. An alternative approach could be the 
direct reduction of NOx with hydrocarbons using a copper/ZSM-5 zeolite cata-
lyst, but this has not yet been feasible, because the catalyst is deactivated at tem-
peratures above 450ºC. Tin oxide, supported on alumina, is also active for the 
reduction of NOx by olefins in lean-burn exhaust gases. The olefin intermediate 
formed on the tin oxide surface can react with nitrogen oxide on an adjacent 
alumina site. Although such catalysts have not yet been used in autocatalysts, it 
is a further example of how autocatalysts, which already contain several compo-
nents, must now be designed for specific duties.37 
464   
Chapter 11 
The use of lean-burn engines will therefore be limited until a viable solution 
to the NOX removal problem has been developed. 
 
11.2.6 Diesel Engines 
 
The efficiency of gasoline engines operating under lean-burn conditions has led 
to a resurgence of interest in diesel engines. The operation of the engine has 
been improved considerably by the use of better fuel injection systems, the use 
of turbo-chargers, and the recirculation of exhaust gases. These changes have 
led to a much lower concentration of pollutants in the exhaust, but there is still a 
need to reduce the concentrations of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitro-
gen oxides even further. The main problems have been caused by the presence 
of oxygen and sulfur dioxide in the exhaust gas from the diesel engine. It has not 
been possible to remove NOx in the presence of oxygen to a satisfactory extent, 
and the sulfur dioxide is converted to sulphate on the washcoat, also contaminat-
ing any soot formed by partial combustion of the diesel fuel. 
 Since the 1980s, the main effort has been on the use of filters to remove 
up to 90% of the soot particles, which themselves contain a soluble organic frac-
tion and some sulphuric acid. There is no regular regeneration of the filters, but 
as the filter takes up the soot particles, there is a gradual increase in pressure 
drop through the filter. This leads to an increase in the temperature of the filter, 
which in turn causes the soot to burn. High temperatures can be generated, and 
these can lead to damage to the filter. 
Catalysts to remove carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from exhaust gas 
have been used in Europe since 1991 with limited application to trucks in the 
US. Platinum or palladium have been used on ceramic monoliths with a special 
washcoat which minimizes sulfate formation. The main characteristics required 
by the catalysts are as follows: 
• High carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon oxidation activity at a low en-
gine temperature. 
• Low sulfur dioxide oxidation activity and low reactivity with sulfur triox-
ide to form sulfate. 
• Thermal stability at maximum engine temperature. 
 The concentration of the active metal usually lies in the range 0.35–1.76 g 
liter-1. Smaller volumes of catalyst are required for diesel engines than for gaso-
line engines, and this results in a higher space velocity. Palladium catalysts have 
a lower activity for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide than platinum catalysts. Nev-
ertheless, a lower metal content is used at the present time to avoid excessive 
oxidation of sulfur dioxide to the trioxide. 
 The activity of the catalyst is adversely affected by the deposition of soot 
particles. It has been shown that a filter that contains a platinum catalyst is ac-
tive for the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide at 195ºC, when using

low-sulfur fuel. The nitrogen dioxide then reacts with the soot at the same tem-
perature with the formation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, so that the filter is 
regenerated continuously, and the levels of NOx are lowered.38 
11.3 VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 
The oxidation of trace amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by cata-
lytic processes was used as early as the 1940s.39 At that time, the main use of the 
procedure was to recover energy or remove unpleasant odors from waste gas 
streams. The US Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970 led to a greater interest in the 
recovery and removal of VOC as oil prices increased and environmental stand-
ards became more stringent. As a result of the Clean Air Act, from 1990 an 
amendment required that a list of areas which did not comply with the National 
Ambient Air Quality Ozone Standard of 0.12 ppm over a one hour period was 
introduced.  
  A federal register was then issued for improvements to be made within a 
period of 3–20 years.40 This meant that VOC removal from a wide range of pro-
cess effluents became necessary. Of the 189 toxic compounds identified by the 
1990 amendments, up to 154 can be removed by oxidation processes and more 
than 20,000 facilities in the US were reporting data to the EPA by 1994. 
The main classification of VOCs include: 
• Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; 
• Organic oxygen and nitrogen compounds; 
• Organic chlorine compounds. 
A list of some of the main activities which could use catalytic oxidation pro-
cesses, together with some of the VOCs emitted, is given in Table 11.14.40 
Both thermal and catalytic oxidation processes have now been used for 
nearly thirty years and almost 100% removal efficiency can be achieved. Cata-
lytic processes are usually felt to be more efficient and economical for the fol-
lowing reasons: 
• lower operating temperature required; 
• significantly lower fuel consumption; 
• lower carbon dioxide emissions; 
• much lower residence time and therefore a smaller reactor; 
• lower capital and operating costs. 
Oxidation catalysts can last for up to twenty years and are easily regenerated, if 
necessary, to remove coke formed by incomplete combustion or particles enter-
ing the bed with the gas stream.

11.3.1 VOC Removal Processes 
 
Early procedures to control VOC emissions included physical adsorption in beds 
of carbon which could be regenerated with steam or hot air to recover the organ-
ic impurity. Thermal combustion took place at temperatures in the range 800°-
900°C. Catalytic oxidation procedures, however, had the advantage of operating 
at high conversion at much lower temperatures and higher space velocities. This 
meant that temperature control was easier and that the smaller reactor led to a 
40 
 
Aliphatic compounds can be removed at temperatures between 200°–300°C 
while aromatic compounds oxidize at slightly higher temperature in the range 
250°–400°C. An important benefit of catalytic oxidation is that the reaction 
tends to take place in the temperature range 200–350ºC, compared with tem-
peratures ranging between 600ºC and 980ºC for thermal oxidation. This has the 
advantage that any carbon monoxide that might be formed in the thermal pro-
cess would easily be removed at very low temperature in the catalytic process. 
The temperature of the catalytic process is also too low for the formation of ni-
tric oxide to occur by direct combination of the elements. Chlorinated com-
pounds can also be oxidised at temperatures up to 450ºC. A comparison of the 
differences between the operating temperatures for the oxidation of some VOCs 
in catalytic and thermal processes is shown in Table 11.15.40,41 
 
reduction in the capital cost.

 When the concentration of hydrocarbons in the feed gas is greater than 
about 0.2%, it may be necessary to carry out the oxidation in tube-cooled con-
verters, to provide adequate control over the temperature of the reaction. 
Simple catalytic combustion units operate by preheating the contaminated 
gas with oxygen to the appropriate operating temperature before it passes direct-
ly to the catalyst bed. The VOCs should be less than 1% volume and the heat of 
combustion can be recovered by heat exchange with cold feed gas. It is usually 
recommended that the concentration of VOCs is less than 25% of the lower ex-
plosive limit.40 
In a typical operation, 0.3–0.4% of mixed aromatic and oxygenated hydro-
carbons are almost completely removed at a space velocity of 40,000 hrs-1 and 
an inlet temperature of 280°C. The increase in temperature is about 100°C per 
0.1% hydrocarbon. When the concentration of hydrocarbons in the feed gas is

11.3.2 VOC Oxidation Catalysts 
 
The active component when treating hydrocarbons is usually high activity 
platinum or palladium, at a concentration of about 0.3-0.5wt%. In the presence 
of poisons or when oxidizing chlorinated hydrocarbons, catalysts such as copper 
chromite promoted with barium oxide, may be used although a higher tempera-
ture is required and the concentration of chlorine compound should be less than 
one volume percent. Details are given in Table 11.17.42 
Other supports, such as ion exchange resins impregnated with chromia or titania 
can be used for the oxidation of halogenated hydrocarbons at temperatures 
around 250°C. Properly operated, precious metal catalysts can have lives ex-
ceeding fifteen years even if regenerated at intervals to remove carbon or dust 
deposits. Base metal catalysts can only operate for shorter periods of a few years 
before being replaced and can be deactivated at temperatures between 500°–
700°C.

The most active catalysts are derived from supported platinum group metals, or 
copper chromite when the VOC contains chlorine. The catalyst supports are 
produced as high surface area gamma-alumina spheres, extrudates or cylindrical 
pellets that can be used in dust free conditions. Alternatively, when treating 
large volumes of effluent gas, honeycomb monoliths made from cordierite or 
metal sheets are coated with a surface washcoat of the same alumina are 
particularly useful. The supports are selected to be stable at the operating 
temperature of the reaction.
