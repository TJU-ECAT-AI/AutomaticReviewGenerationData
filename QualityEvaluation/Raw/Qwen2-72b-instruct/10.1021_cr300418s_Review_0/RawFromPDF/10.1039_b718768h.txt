Ultrathin oxide ﬁlms on metals oﬀer new opportunities for the design of supported nanoclusters
with potential use in catalysis. This requires a characterization at the atomistic level of the
structure and composition of the thin ﬁlm, of its morphology and defect structure. A proper
selection of metal/oxide interface, ﬁlm thickness, lattice mismatch, etc. makes it possible to
prepare collections of supported metal particles with novel properties. This critical review
describes some illustrative examples, emphasizes the role of the interplay between theory and
experiment, and relates some recent ﬁndings related to the possibility to control the charge state
of a supported nanoparticle on an ultrathin oxide ﬁlm (211 references).

Introduction
Ultrathin oxide ﬁlms of thicknesses of 20 A
˚ or less grown on
metal substrates as opposed to oxide single crystals have been
recognised as systems that lend themselves to studies at the
atomic scale, as they may be investigated using charged
information carriers because charging may be avoided.1–4
The latter is often a problem in connection with the use of
insulating bulk materials as samples.5,6 By applying spectro-
scopic and scanning probe techniques it is possible to gain the
desired information at the atomic level. The information
available on ultrathin oxide ﬁlms, their preparation and
properties have been reviewed.1–5,7–14 Here we concentrate
on the possibilities to use oxide ﬁlms on one hand to model
dispersed metal catalysts as they are typically prepared on
oxide powders,7–14 and, on the other hand, to use them as
materials in their own right, perhaps even as a new class of
materials whose properties are determined by the combination
of properties of the ﬁlm together with those of their sup-
port.15–17 We may switch between those regimes by controlling
the thickness of the oxide ﬁlm. The properties of thick ﬁlms of
only 5–10 layers approach those of the bulk material while
ultrathin ﬁlms with a thickness of 1–5 layers on metallic
supports may sometimes—not always—represent materials
exposing properties very diﬀerent from the bulk material.
Historically, it was the desire to be able to approach the bulk
properties of catalytically active materials which lead to study
thin ﬁlms trying to collect reproducible information with
surface spectroscopies as mentioned above. This idea led
Vurens et al.18,19 in the late 1980s to prepare well ordered
iron-oxide ﬁlms on a metal support (Pt(111)) to model materi-
als active in ammonia synthesis. Xu and Goodman20,21 started
to prepare thin SiO2 and alumina ﬁlms to be used as supports
for dispersed metal particles, however, the silica and alumina
ﬁlms were amorphous. Well ordered oxide ﬁlms of MgO on
Mo(100)22–32 and also NiO on Ni(100)33–37 were grown early
on with the idea in mind to study oxide ﬁlm properties in
general and in particular with respect to molecular adsorption.
In both those speciﬁc cases, however, the misﬁt between oxide

and support was substantial, so that defect sites, such as steps
and corners determined in part the interaction of such surfaces
with adsorbates from the gas phase. When one carefully
blocked those defect sites by water adsorption the properties

of the thin ﬁlm were in remarkable correspondence to the bulk
material. Fig. 1 shows the CO and NO thermal desorption
spectra from NiO(100) ﬁlm and bulk material. There is a one-
to-one correspondence indicating that these thin ﬁlms may be
used to model the surface of the bulk material.38,39 Under-
standing the adsorption properties on the basis of theoretical
calculations was a long and painful eﬀort38,40–51 that we do not
have space to describe in this review in detail, however,
modelling the structure of those rock salt (100) surfaces
themselves does not represent a major problem.
It is possible to grow very smooth ﬁlms of MgO in (100)
orientation on Ag(100) where the oxide to metal misﬁt is rather
small as was shown by Henzler, Pfnu
¨ r and co-workers.52,53
Fig. 2 shows a series of images representing the growth of a
thin MgO(100) ﬁlm which ﬁnally exhibits very smooth terraces
and single layer steps between areas of diﬀerent thickness.
Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) may be used to mea-
sure scanning tunnelling spectra (STS) on diﬀerent terraces
representing diﬀerent thicknesses in an attempt to unravel the
electronic structure as a function of thickness.54–58 In parti-
cular, the band gaps between occupied and unoccupied states
may be determined and it is clear from those studies that ﬁlms
above a thickness of 5 monolayers (ML) or so approach the
situation encountered on a surface of the bulk material. A
surface of an 8 monolayer ﬁlm exposes ﬂat terraces as well as
line defects but hardly any point defects,48,59 i.e. the so called
colour centres. The latter may be created through electron
bombardment, and the nature of the defect may be controlled
via the electron dose, opening up the opportunity to engineer
the defect structure of the surface (see section 7).59 This is
important, as the chemical activity of simple metal oxide
surfaces is largely determined by the presence and particular
properties of irregularities in the surface.

Structure of oxide thin ﬁlms
While MgO ﬁlms exhibit a structure very similar to bulk MgO,
except for a small change in lattice parameters for very thin
ﬁlms, there are oxide ﬁlms that reveal structures rather diﬀerent
from the bulk material. One such example that has been
investigated early on is a thin alumina ﬁlm grown on a NiAl(110)
surface.60–63 Fig. 3(a) shows a large-scale scanning tunnelling
micrograph of the ﬁlm. Detailed low-temperature STM images
revealed the morphology of the ﬁlm as shown in Fig. 3(b). It is
very smooth and exhibits a network of line defects (bright) which
have been identiﬁed as grain boundaries between two reﬂection
domains, (A and B), and so-called anti-phase domain bound-
aries (A–A, B–B) within a given reﬂection domain. The network
originates from the incommensurability of the alumina ﬁlm
structure and the structure of the NiAl(110) surface in one
crystallographic direction.61,62 Also, it was possible to atomically
resolve the anti-phase domain line defects which turn out to be
nucleation sites for metal clusters grown at room temperature
for example in the case of Pd as shown in Fig. 4.64–68 Such
systems have been extensively studied with respect to chemical
reactions on them and a very close correspondence to powder
catalysts was revealed.69–77 Examples are hydrogenation of
unsaturated hydrocarbons,69–72 dissociation of nitrous oxide73,74
and the oxidation of methanol76,77 and CO.75
In addition to simple metal oxides, which are often used as
metal particle support materials, thin ﬁlms of transition metal
oxides have been prepared.18,19,78 Netzer and co-workers have
published a series of spectacular studies on vanadium-oxide
thin ﬁlms as a function of coverage and thickness, literally
exploring the entire phase diagram.79–82 In particular, Netzer

and co-workers78–82 and also Kuhlenbeck and others83–87 have
studied the surfaces of the stoichiometric vanadium-oxide
ﬁlms. In Fig. 5(a) we show STM images of a V2O5(010) ﬁlm
on Au(111).88 The double rows of the protruding oxygen
atoms (Fig. 5(b)) are believed to be imaged based on calcula-
tions.89 The structure of a single V2O5 layer is very similar to
the bulk structure90 which is represented by a stacking of
individual layers held together by van der Waals forces. Fig. 6
shows the STM image of yet another vanadium oxide ﬁlm, i.e.
V2O3(0001) on Au(111).83–87 Such a ﬁlm appears to expose a
surface that is, in agreement with expectations for a dipolar
compensated corundum type surface, exposing at the top only
half a metal ion layer as compared to the bulk (Fig. 7(a)). This
surface termination has been considered to be the most stable
one for all the corundum type A2O3 oxides in ultrahigh
vacuum.3,91 The interlayer distances towards the bulk are
strongly relaxed as indicated in Fig. 7(a) for Al2O3,92
Cr2O3
3,93–96 and Fe2O3.97,98 This is also true for V2O3.99
However, under oxygen rich conditions the surface termina-
tion is diﬀerent as was initially demonstrated for the case of
Cr2O3(0001), and subsequently also seen for all other surfaces
mentioned, except for Al2O3.92 Under oxygen rich conditions
each surface metal ion picks up an oxygen atom to form a
metal oxygen double bond (Fig. 7(b)). For Cr2O3(0001) this
means the surface is chromyl terminated, for V2O3(0001)100 it
is vanadyl terminated and for Fe2O3(0001),98,101 perhaps
surprisingly, it is ferryl terminated. Experimental evidence
for this comes from structure determinations but primarily
from spectroscopic information, i.e. vibrational spectro-
scopy.98 The metal–oxygen double bonds give rise to very
characteristic spectral features. The termination is also sup-
ported by calculations101 on the surface stability when diﬀer-
ent terminations are compared. Fig. 8 shows the result of a
calculation for the Fe2O3(0001) surface termination as a
function of oxygen pressure and temperature (see section 3
for details on how these diagrams are obtained). It reveals the
highest stability of the metal terminated surface under ultra-
high vacuum conditions and a metal–oxygen double bond
termination for oxygen richer conditions. It should be men-
tioned that the presence of the metal–oxygen double bonds
also leads to changes in the relaxation of the layer distances
below the surface.100
These cases may serve as characteristic examples for thin
oxide ﬁlms whose structure has been determined. A number

Role of theory to resolve the structure
The previous discussion has shown that the structure of ultra
thin oxide ﬁlms may diﬀer substantially from that of the
corresponding bulk crystalline oxides. This is true in particular
for monolayers and in the sub-monolayer regime. Sometimes
not only the structure, but even the composition of the ﬁlm can
be very diﬀerent from that of the stoichiometric oxide phase.
The characterization of these unusual structures and composi-
tions is a challenge, both experimentally and theoretically. In
the last decade we have witnessed a growing role of theory in
the elucidation of ﬁlm structure and composition. Modern
density functional theory (DFT) based on accurate gradient
corrected functionals, together with the possibility to use large
supercells containing hundreds of atoms, opens the possibility
to explore the conﬁguration space and to obtain detailed
insight into the microscopic regime. The results of DFT can

be combined with concepts from thermodynamics and statis-
tical mechanics to reach the meso- and microscopic re-
gimes.115,116 This is often referred to as ‘‘ﬁrst principle’’ or
ab initio thermodynamics. In electronic structure calculations
temperature and pressure eﬀects are not included, and the
results are valid in the limit of T = 0 and p = 0. The eﬀect of
temperature on the atomic positions can be obtained by
evaluating the total energy as function of the nuclear positions
on the Born–Oppenheimer surface. Additional information,
such as vibrational modes, can then be extracted from the
potential energy surface. The information coming from the
DFT calculations can be used as an input for thermodynamic
considerations, and the key quantity, the Gibbs free energy G,
can be evaluated over the whole T and p range (eqn (1)):
G(T,p) = Etot + Fvib  TSconf + pV
(1)
Etot is the leading term and is directly obtained from DFT. The
second term, Fvib, accounts for the vibrational contributions;
TSconf includes the conﬁgurational entropy, while the last term
is the classical pV contribution. This scheme applies to systems
in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is important since a system in
thermodynamic equilibrium can be divided into subsystems
which are also in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other.

In the context of oxide thin ﬁlms, usually one is dealing with a
surface in contact with an oxygen atmosphere and the environ-
ment acts as a reservoir which can give or take any amount of
oxygen to or from the sample without changing T or p. This
allows to treat every subsystem, e.g. bulk or gas-phase, within
DFT separately from the rest. The problem then becomes the
calculation of the various contributions, which is usually
expressed in terms of the chemical potential mi(T, pi) of all
species in the system.115,116 Since chemical potentials are
directly related to temperature and partial pressure, a compar-
ison of the whole range of experimentally accessible gas-phase
conditions is achieved. In experiments one typically varies O2
pressure and temperature, and mO(T, pO) is a central quantity
which can vary from very low values (O-poor limit) to high
values (O-rich limit). This approach has been applied success-
fully to a series of oxide surfaces and ﬁlms, and it is now
routinely used to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of a
given oxide phase at particular T and p values (see Fig. 8).
However, the ab initio thermodynamic approach can only be
used to compare diﬀerent structures and compositions but
cannot predict new phases. Usually one starts from a given
set of proposed structures, based either on experimental evi-
dence or on chemical intuition, which can be directly compared
over a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. New
structures can be obtained in the course of full geometrical
optimization at the DFT level, and can be included into the
phase diagram at relatively low computational cost. But one
should always be aware of the fact that any conﬁguration which
is not included in the considerations cannot appear as a stable
structure. Therefore, one has to explore a rather large set of
possible structures and compositions, and there is no guarantee
that an important structure is not missing. For this reason the
results of ab initio thermodynamics have to be validated by a
direct comparison of observable quantities of the most stable
structures derived from DFT with experimental data.
A pedagogical example for the resolution of the structure of
a thin oxide ﬁlm by interplay between theory and experiment is
provided by the case of crystalline silica ﬁlms on Mo(112).
Below we will discuss the peculiar properties of these and
related ﬁlms as two-dimensional molecular sieves (section 5),
properties which are closely connected to the structure of these
ﬁlms. It is only recently that it was succeeded in the prepara-
tion of crystalline silica ﬁlms.109–111 In fact, silica surfaces are
often disordered. Thin silica ﬁlms, well known for their use in
the microelectronic industry, grow amorphously not only on
Si but also on single-crystal metal surfaces like Mo(110) and
Mo(100).21,117 The substrate used to grow crystalline silica
ﬁlms is Mo(112) and the procedure consists of repeated cycles
of Si deposition and subsequent oxidation, followed by a ﬁnal
annealing at T 4 1100 K. LEED pictures show a hexagonal
SiO2 overlayer with c(22) periodicity.109–111 Anti-phase do-
main boundaries split the silica epilayer into an array of silica
crystal grains. The structure of the ﬁlms has been subject to an
intense debate, starting from the question of ﬁlm thickness. It
turned out that the ﬁlm has a thickness of 5 A
˚ ; STM images
(Fig. 9(a)) show that the ﬁlm is ﬂat, homogeneous and almost
defect free,111 XPS and IRAS data indicate a simple atomic
structure and the presence of two kind of oxygen atoms, but
also a high symmetry of the ﬁlm;118,119 adsorption experiments
show that the surface is chemically inert, i.e. is fully saturated
and does not present strained rings or other reactive sites.120
The ﬁrst models proposed for the structure, based on two-
or three-layer thick silica ﬁlms with cristobalite structure,121
were discarded because of the presence of strained two-mem-
bered rings on the surface which should easily react with
water, at variance with the hydrophobic character of the
surface. However, the observation that layered silicates exists
with hexagonal pattern and high chemical inertness, has
stimulated the search for possible structures which can be
adapted to the Mo(112) substrate.111,122 The ﬁrst problem to
address was that of stoichiometry; while some structures
derived from layered silicates have the correct SiO2 stoichio-
metry, others have a composition with an excess of oxygen;
this is true in particular for a single layer. A number of
possible structures having the correct c(22) periodicity have
then been constructed, and the surface free energy of forma-
tion as a function of the oxygen chemical potential has been
determined for two sets of temperature, 300 K and 1200 K. It
emerges from the DFT calculations that the thermodynami-
cally most favourable structure consists of a single layer of
SiO4 tetrahedra which share three oxygen atoms forming three
Si–O–Si bridges with the forth oxygen directly bound to the
Mo substrate. The preferred structure is the one with the O
atoms in bridge sites (see the schematic structure in Fig. 9(b)).
As we mentioned above, that fact that the structure in
Fig. 9(b) is the most stable one according to ab initio thermo-
dynamics, is not a suﬃcient proof that this corresponds to the
real structure. In this respect, the phonon spectrum of the ﬁlm

provides direct information about the structure. The IRAS
spectra show a sharp peak at 1059 cm1 and small peaks at
771 and 675 cm1. Both the positions and relative intensities of
the calculated harmonic frequencies for the structure shown in
Fig. 9(b) are in excellent agreement with experiment.118 This is
obtained after scaling the computed frequencies to take into
account anharmonic eﬀects; the scaling factor has been deter-
mined by ﬁtting the experimental frequencies of a-quartz.
Notice that the computed frequencies of other, less stable,
structures, are in poor agreement with the IRAS spectra.
Additional evidence in favour of the structure indicated by
ab initio thermodynamic comes from the analysis of the core
level binding energies. These are often diﬃcult to reproduce
based on one-electron energy levels because of the occurrence
of ﬁnal state eﬀects. The latter can be included making use of a
modiﬁed projected augmented wave method. It turns out that
the O atom at the interface is shifted to smaller binding energy
by 1.3 eV compared to the O atoms of the surface layer. This is
exactly the diﬀerence found between the peaks maxima in the
high-resolution XPS spectra obtained using synchrotron ra-
diation. Also in this case the agreement is not fortuitous: other
models exhibit quite diﬀerent shifts. Further validation of the
proposed structural model comes from the comparison of the
measured and simulated STM images obtained from the self-
consistent charge density employing the Tersoﬀ–Hamann
approach.123 High-resolution STM images (see Fig. 9(a)) show
a honeycomb-like structure where the protrusions have been
identiﬁed as the O atoms in the topmost layer; this is fully
consistent with the simulated images. In addition to this, the
STM images of the silica ﬁlm show the presence of line defects
running along the Mo(110) direction which consist of alter-
nating eight- and four-membered rings. The appearance of
these defects is practically identical in the real and in the
simulated images.119
The resolution of the structure of the crystalline silica ﬁlms
on Mo(112) is only one of the several successful examples
where the combined use of theory and experiment has pro-
duced a clear and unambiguous determination of the micro-
scopic structure at atomistic level.63,68,80,124–126 The possibility
to fully characterize the oxide support is the necessary pre-
requisite for any further study of the formation and chemical
activity of supported metal clusters.
4.
Oxide ﬁlms as templates for cluster growth
As already mentioned above, oxide ﬁlms have been used as
supports for metal clusters. In Fig. 4 we had shown an
example of Pd clusters whose growth was controlled by the
local defect structure of the ﬁlm. Understanding the growth of
particles is important, in particular, when diﬀerent metals are
compared.127–131 The growth mode is controlled by the for-
mation of the nuclei, of course, and it appears to be almost
always a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism.3 Thus, the
stability of the nuclei and their interaction with the substrate
determines growth, and, consequently, the stability and mor-
phology of the particles depend on the type of metal deposited
on the oxide ﬁlm. It turns out that, for example, Co interacts
strongly with an alumina substrate while Pd interacts more
weakly and is considerably more mobile. This leads to the
formation of relatively big Pd clusters at room temperature as
shown in Fig. 4 while Co forms small clusters, homogeneously
distributed across the surface (not shown).132 Such behaviour
opens up the possibility to prepare a homogeneous Co/Pd
alloy particle ensemble by exposing the surface ﬁrst to Co and
subsequently to Pd. A reverse deposition would lead to a
segregated system.127–129
It is obvious that the distribution and shape of the metal
particles are determined by the distribution of defects on the
surfaces and the equilibrium properties of the metal. The
challenge is to control both shape and distribution. Thin ﬁlms
oﬀer an opportunity to achieve this goal. An example for
shape control is the growth of Au133,134 on the above men-
tioned alumina ﬁlm.60,61 Fig. 10 shows STM images of an Au
heptamer on the alumina ﬁlm. The particle exhibits a chain
structure, very diﬀerent from the expected equilibrium particle
shape. A combination of detailed experiments on the chains as
a function of length combined with theoretical calculations
clearly shows that this morphology is an eﬀect of the interac-
tion of the Au atoms on the ﬁlm with the NiAl(110) substrate
underneath the alumina ﬁlm.134 Speciﬁcally, the interaction is
such that Al atoms in the substrate transfer electrons to some
of the Au atoms in the chains. Because the registry between the
oxide and the NiAl substrate deﬁnes an angle (which is equal
and opposite in sign on the two reﬂection dynamics of the ﬁlm,
see Fig. 10), the Au chains length is ﬁnite and limited to seven
Au atoms. For clusters containing more atoms the energy of a
two-dimensional cluster is degenerate with the linear shape so
that from seven atoms on the cluster shape becomes two-
dimensional.134 Fig. 10(b) contains a current image of the Au
heptamer at a bias voltage equivalent to the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) of the system as deduced from
scanning tunnelling spectra.134 In principle this allows us to
count the number of electrons on the chain. The electronic
structure may, in ﬁrst approximation, be described by a
particle-in-the-box, where the highest occupied orbital is made

up from one Au 6s electron per Au atom. Seven Au atoms in a
neutral chain would contribute seven electrons occupying four
orbitals with the highest having three nodes. However, the
HOMO, as imaged, exhibits four nodes, while the lowest
unoccupied orbital, LUMO (not shown) exhibits ﬁve nodes.
This means the chain picks up three electrons from the
substrate to become a diamagnetic Au chain. Chains of
diﬀerent length have been studied.134
In the case, just described, the shape of the cluster is
controlled, while the arrangement of clusters is not, of course.
The interaction between the metal on the oxide ﬁlm and the
oxide metal support system may, however, be used to self-
organize the arrangement of metal atoms on the surface.135,136
Au on FeO(111)/Pt(111)135,136 is an example to illustrate the
eﬀects. Fig. 11(a) shows Au atoms deposited onto such a ﬁlm
as imaged with a low-temperature STM. The Moire
´ -structure
is clearly visible concomitantly with the atomic resolution of
the oxide ﬁlm (Fig. 11(b)).105,106 The Moire
´ -structure is caused
by the incommensurability of the FeO(111) ﬁlm and the
Pt(111) surface as indicated (Fig. 11(c)). It has been shown
that the FeO ﬁlm consists of a Fe–O double-layer,107 which
locks into positions with the substrate in speciﬁc sites
(Fig. 11(c)). The Fe–O double layer exhibits a dipole moment
which varies across the ﬁlm, depending on how the ﬁlm arranges
locally with respect to the substrate, and which will thus follow
the Moire
´ pattern.24,137 The work-function varies locally by
several tenths of an eV. The easily polarisable Au atoms feel
the surface potential and are directed to those areas where the
work-function is largest. This leads to a regular arrangement of
Au atoms across the surface with rather well deﬁned distances.
A regular arrangement of clusters as opposed to atoms can
be prepared on an alumina ﬁlm grown on Ni3Al(111) as
originally investigated by Wandelt and his group.138–140
Fig. 12 shows an STM image of the ﬁlm revealing that it
contains a regular system of ‘‘pinholes’’ (hexagons) which may
act as anchoring points for metal atoms and eventually as
nucleation centers for clusters.124 This will then lead to a
regular array of clusters if the interaction of the metal atoms
forming the nuclei is suﬃciently strong. Fig. 13 shows an array

of vanadium clusters141 grown on such a surface. As noted by
Wandelt, obviously, this system oﬀers interesting possibilities
to create ordered arrays of particular metals, for example,
magnetic particles or metal clusters with interesting optical
properties related to plasmons, such as Au. Also, interesting
phenomena in adsorption and reaction may be studied.
Further interesting systems are the recently investigated
TiOx ﬁlms on Pt.142–144 TiOx on Pt(111)142 and Pt(110)143
forms a series of well ordered networks of not yet exactly
known stoichiometries. Fig. 14 shows an STM image of the so-
called k-TiOx phase on Pt(111). The ﬁlm is well ordered and
higher resolution reveals details that may be correlated with
atomic structure. The dark areas are believed to be ‘‘pinholes’’
in the ﬁlm which may be used to nucleate metal particles as in
the previous case of the alumina ﬁlm.144 Also a stoichiometric
TiO2 phase with lepidocrocite structure has been prepared on
Pt(111).145

Oxide ﬁlms as molecular sieves
Surface science has considerably contributed to our under-
standing of the structure and properties of supported nano-
particles on ﬂat surfaces, a class of systems of particular
interest in heterogeneous catalysis. There is another class of
catalysts, based on alumo-silicates (zeolites) which are of
enormous importance in the industrial application of cataly-
sis.146 One of the simple reason why surface science has not
contributed substantially in those cases is that here catalysis
happens in micro-cavities inside the alumo-silicates, i.e. an
inner surface not accessible with typical surface science scales.
One question to ask is: would it be possible to prepare ﬂat
alumo-silicates which lend themselves to some fundamental
surface science studies in this ﬁeld?
First attempts in this direction have been undertaken by
preparing well ordered silicates on metal surfaces with the goal
to eventually exchange part of the silicon atoms by aluminium
atoms. We refer again to Fig. 9 showing an STM image of the
above discussed silica ﬁlm on Mo(112).109–111 It is possible to
exchange some of the silicon atoms by aluminium atoms. Such
a situation is shown in Fig. 15 where the bright protrusions
correlate with the presence of aluminium atoms,147 as its
number depends directly on the amount of Al incorporated
into the ﬁlm. In a real, i.e. non metal supported alumo-silicate,
the replacement of silicon by aluminium atoms is accompanied
by hydroxylation of the equivalent number of oxygen atoms to
compensate the change in valence from Si(4) to Al(3). It is
interesting to note that in a ﬂat alumo-silicate ﬁlm on a metal
substrate, the change in valence may be compensated by
screening from the metal surface, i.e. hydroxylation is not
necessary. This has been corroborated experimentally.147
Obviously, if it were possible to grow thicker alumo-silicate
ﬁlms one would expect to eventually create a situation where
the system does contain hydroxylated oxygen atoms after
aluminium exchange thus approaching a ﬂat alumo-silicate.
This goal has not yet been achieved, but ﬁrst attempts have
been made to form ﬂat silica ﬁlms of larger thickness. These
ﬁlms, so far, turn out to be disordered but they are ﬂat on a
roughness scale of 2 A
˚ . We can expect interesting develop-
ments in this area.148
Very recently, the interaction of metal atoms with metal
supported silicate ﬁlms has been studied. Here we note an
interesting analogy to the ordered ‘‘pinholes’’ on the alumina
ﬁlm on Ni3Al(111). The silica ﬁlm may be looked at as an
ordered arrangement of holes, or a molecular sieve.149,150
Depending on the ‘‘size’’ of metal atoms, for example Pd vs.
Au, the ‘‘smaller’’ Pd atom penetrates the two-dimensional
silica network, while the ‘‘bigger’’ Au atom stays on top of the
silica ﬁlm, behaving—indeed—like a molecular sieve. It is
possible to follow the process by low-temperature STM and
look in detail at the interaction of the metal atom with the
silica substrate after penetration and on top. Some images
are shown in Fig. 16(a) where even the slight asymmetry of the
interaction of Pd with the silica network becomes visible which
are remarkably well reproduced by theoretical calculations. It
is interesting to note that the silica ﬁlm contains anti-phase
boundaries as indicated in Fig. 16 (left top panel) where the
openings in the network are ‘‘eight’’- instead of ‘‘six’’-
membered rings (see section 3). Here the Au atoms may
penetrate and even form penetrated dimers as documented
by the images and the schematic representations shown in
parallel in Fig. 16(b).149,150

Activation of supported particles on speciﬁc
defects
We have seen above that STM is essential to obtain direct
images of the structure of the oxide surface and of the
supported nanoclusters. This is a crucial aspect since the
identiﬁcation of the structure and composition of a supported
particle or a metal cluster is a diﬃcult task. However, STM is
not only useful as characterization tool, but also to stimulate
and activate the aggregation of individual atoms and to build
well deﬁned nanoclusters, as already alluded to in section 5
with respect to Pd/Au alloy formation, providing in this way
essential information to understand the basic mechanisms of
nucleation and growth.151 A recent example is that of Pd
atoms deposited on a 3 ML MgO ﬁlm on Ag(100), shown in
Fig. 17. The Pd/MgO system is particularly interesting since
MgO-supported Pd nanoparticles are among the best studied
model catalysts in terms of cluster growth and structure as well
as catalytic activity, which was found even in the single atom
regime.152 Using a low-temperature STM it has been possible
to image isolated Pd atoms on the surface, Fig. 17(a)–(d), and,
applying a small voltage pulse, to induce diﬀusion of the atom
and formation of Pd dimers and trimers, Fig. 17(e)–(j). The
shape, adsorption site and orientation of the clusters corres-
ponds to that predicted by periodic DFT calculations. Once
the precise structure and adsorption mode of a nanocluster is
known, one can also obtain ST spectra on a single cluster
obtaining direct information on the electronic structure, in
particular the energy position of the ﬁlled and empty levels of
the metal cluster. This example clearly shows that by combin-
ing ultra-thin ﬁlm technology with low-temperature STM and
theoretical calculations it is nowadays possible to fully identi-
fy, both structurally and electronically, the metal species which
are present on the oxide surface.
Another aspect where STM plays an important role is in
providing essential information on the nature and distribution
of point or extended defects on the oxide surface. In the last
few years, strong evidence has accumulated showing that
metal clusters nucleate preferentially on defect sites where
the metal–oxide interaction is usually stronger.153–156 The
precise nature of these sites is, however, highly elusive, and
often based on speculations or, sometimes, on theoretical
calculations. On extended defects such as steps, domain
boundaries, etc. the presence of ions with lower coordination
oﬀers an opportunity for binding more strongly the deposited
metal atoms or clusters. On point defects, like vacancies,
impurity atoms, trapped electrons or holes, the presence of
excess or unpaired electrons is usually the reason for the
enhanced bonding.157 One of the point defects which has
attracted more attention is, for obvious reasons, the oxygen
vacancy. Oxygen vacancies are in fact present in many oxides
as the result of the easy formation of molecular O2 at high
temperatures, with consequent reduction of the sample. The
nature
and
concentration
of
oxygen
vacancies

signiﬁcantly from oxide to oxide, and often provides a kind of
‘‘ﬁngerprint’’ of the electronic structure of the oxide itself.158
For ionic materials, like the alkaline-earth oxides or alumina,
an oxygen vacancy consists of two electrons trapped in the
cavity left by the missing oxygen (F center), Fig. 18. The
electrons are spatially localized by the strong electrostatic
potential of the ionic crystal and the system undergoes little
geometrical relaxation. In covalent polar oxides, like silica, the
removal of an oxygen atom results in two dangling bonds on
adjacent Si atoms which recombine to form a direct Si–Si bond
with strong geometrical relaxation, Fig. 18. On reducible
transition metal oxides, such as TiO2, the oxygen deﬁciency
results in localized electrons in the 3d shell of speciﬁc transi-
tion metal ions which change their formal oxidation state from
Mn+ to M(n1)+, Fig. 18. These are clear cut examples: in
many oxides the situation is intermediate between these ex-
tremes. In any case, the presence of extra electrons associated
to the vacancy results in stronger bonds with a metal particle
but also in the possibility to alter the chemical nature of the
supported cluster.159,160 Examples in this direction have been
reported for several systems, and in particular for TiO2, an
oxide which contains a relatively large amount of surface
oxygen vacancies.161 Usually, the concentration of such de-
fects is much lower in non-reducible oxides like MgO.
The activity of a supported cluster can be rather diﬀerent
when defect containing or defect free surfaces are compared.
For instance, Au8 clusters produced in the gas phase, mass-
selected, and deposited on MgO ﬁlms by a soft-landing
method, exhibit a quite diﬀerent reactivity in CO oxidation
when supported on defect-free or defect-rich MgO/Mo(100)
ﬁlms.162 In particular, the activity is much more pronounced
when the clusters are deposited on a defect-rich surface. The
interpretation of this result, based on DFT calculations, starts
from the hypothesis that the Au8 cluster sits on a speciﬁc
defect, i.e. a surface oxygen vacancy of the MgO(100) surface.
The extra electrons trapped in the F center are partially
donated to gold with consequent lowering of the activation
barriers for the reaction. However, recent results on MgO/
Ag(100) ﬁlms have shown that the concentration of F centers
on the as-grown ﬁlms is very low.54,59 Even the detection of the
paramagnetic variant of the oxygen vacancy, the F+ center
with a single trapped electron, failed despite the use of the
rather sensitive EPR technique. In order to be observed and
characterized spectroscopically, the number of F and F+
centers has to be increased artiﬁcially, for instance by electron
bombardment of the surface. Once this has been done, it has
been possible to fully identify these defect centers. The com-
bined use of EPR spectra and STM images, Fig. 19, has
allowed identiﬁcation of the preferential generation of F+
centers on the edges of the MgO ﬁlm,54 where the formation
energy of the defect is lower, as predicted theoretically.163 Of
course, EPR is sensitive only to the paramagnetic defects. The
presence of the corresponding diamagnetic neutral F centers
has been deduced and conﬁrmed by a careful analysis of the
spots corresponding to the isolated defects, and by consequent
STS spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 19. The charge state of
defects has been manipulated by interactions with the STM
tip. Depending on the location of the defect, it has been
possible to observe defect energy levels in the band gap of
MgO and to compare them with the ground state energy levels
computed with DFT, thus corroborating the assignment of the
defects to F and F+ centers.59
In this way one can properly functionalize an oxide surface
by generating a given number of well identiﬁed defects. The
subsequent deposition of low amounts of gold atoms from the
vapour phase, results in the formation of nano aggregates. In
fact, the atoms arriving from the gas-phase dissipate their
thermal energy by rapid diﬀusion on the surface (the estimated
diﬀusion barriers are low.164 STM images of Au on MgO ﬁlms
show that nucleation occurs in correspondence of the point
defects which provide strong anchoring points for the clusters
thus avoiding further diﬀusion.165 So, the ﬁrst role of the
defect is to favour nucleation and growth. However, the
electrons trapped in the vacancy can be partially donated to
the supported nano-particle, resulting in electron-rich metal
clusters with enhanced chemical activity. The best proof of a
change in the electronic structure of the metal cluster, and of
the occurrence of a negative charging, is CO vibrational
spectroscopy. CO is widely and normally used in this context;
a blue shift of the C–O vibrational frequency compared to the
free molecule indicates the interaction with an acid site (a
cation of the oxide surface, a metal cluster in positive oxida-
tion state, Md+); a red shift is typical of basic sites or of the
presence of metallic particles. A C–O vibrational shift to lower
frequencies reﬂects the occurrence of a back donation of
charge from metal d orbitals into the 2p* anti-bonding orbital
of CO, so producing a weakening of the CO bond strength and
an elongation of the CO bond. In particular, CO exhibits
rather
typical
frequencies
when
adsorbed
on
oxidized,
neutral or reduced gold particles: the typical ranges are
2150–2180 cm1 for Aud+, 2110–2120 cm1 for Au0, and
2000–2090 cm1 for anionic gold, Aud.166 A quantitative
correlation between the Au net charge and the CO frequency
has been established in gas-phase experiments on mass-
selected gold clusters cations and anions with one adsorbed

CO molecule.167 On regular, non-defective MgO ﬁlms CO
adsorbed on metallic gold particles show frequencies around
2120 cm1, with a shift of about 20 cm1 with respect to the free
molecule; after creation of oxygen vacancies and formation
of the gold clusters in correspondence to these defects by
self-assembly of deposited gold atoms, the CO frequency
decreases to about 2070 cm1, with a red shift of about
50 cm1.166 This is the shift predicted by DFT calculations
when one electron is added to a cluster of 8–10 metal atoms
surrounded by CO ligands;168 it is also fully consistent with the
measurements of gas-phase gold cluster anions with one ad-
sorbed CO molecule.167 These elegant experiments show un-
ambiguously that the interaction of metal nanoparticles (not
only gold) with oxygen vacancies leads to electron rich metal
clusters, an aspect which is important for the rationalization of
the observed chemical activity of supported nanoparticles.
The role of the charge on the catalytic activity of supported
nanoclusters has been a matter of intense debate especially for
the case of gold. Gold nanoparticles deposited on the surface
of transition-metal or rare-earth oxides such as TiO2 or CeO2
are active species in the conversion of CO to CO2 as well as in
other catalytic processes. After the discovery of Haruta et al.
that, once prepared in the form of nanoparticles, gold becomes
an active catalyst169 a large number of studies has been made
with the goal of elucidating the origin of this special activ-
ity.170,171 There is little doubt that this is related to the small
dimensions of the metal particles; while particles of 2–3 nm in
diameter are good catalysts, larger particles are inactive.172
Beside this aspect, however, the reasons for the enhanced
activity are not yet fully clariﬁed. Some authors believe that
this is due to the relatively large number of low-coordinated
sites at the surface of a nanoparticle; some experiments point
to a special role of the oxide support; in other studies it has
been proposed that the reason for the enhanced activity is the
oxidation state of gold;162,166,173–181 most probably, all these
eﬀects are important and act together, although their relative
contribution can change from case to case. What is certain is
that the activity of nanostructured gold depends on the
preparation of the sample, on the nature of the oxide substrate
and on the particle size and shape.182–185 Among all these
factors, the charge state of the gold nanoclusters is often
controversial. Some studies suggest that the active catalyst is
cationic gold,186,187 and that this ‘‘oxidation’’ occurs in the
course of catalytic reactions in the presence of oxygen.188,189
Other studies, on the contrary, including the above mentioned
UHV experiments on mass selected gold clusters, have shown
that
negatively
charged
gold
is
chemically
more
ac-
tive.162,166,190,191 Experiments in gas-phase have demonstrated
that the presence of an extra negative charge on a Au cluster
results in an easier breaking of bonds of adsorbed molecules,
O2 in particular, and in an enhanced chemical activity.192 On a
surface, the extra charge can be provided by the interaction
with speciﬁc defects, such as oxygen vacancies. However, in
order to make this a viable way to design new catalysts based
on ‘‘electron-rich’’ supported particles, one has to overcome
two problems. The ﬁrst one is the number of these defects in
the as prepared support oxide. We have already mentioned
above that often the concentration of point defects is below
detection limit, and that in order to be observed and studied,
their number has to be increased artiﬁcially. The other pro-
blem is the possibility for these defect centers to ‘‘survive’’
under reaction conditions, in particular when dealing with
oxidation reactions and the presence of a high oxygen partial
pressure. In fact, O2 molecules adsorb and react with the
supported metal particle, with activation and elongation of
the O–O bond. If one of the oxygen atoms is involved in the
oxidation of a particular molecule (an organic substrate, CO,
etc.), the remaining oxygen atom can easily diﬀuse to the
cluster–oxide interface and ﬁll the vacancy. This process is
accompanied by a large energy gain and of course leads to a
suppression of the special activity connected to this center.
Unless oxygen vacancies are continuously provided in the
course of the reaction, for instance by diﬀusion from the bulk
to the surface, the catalytic cycle will be broken. This is not
restricted to oxidation reactions, as other processes can lead as
well to a ﬁlling of the vacancy with atoms or molecular
fragments with modiﬁcation of the electronic structure of the
nanoparticle and suppression or reduction of its activity.

Charging of clusters on defect-free ultra-thin
oxide ﬁlms
In this respect, a new phenomenon recently discovered and
entirely related to the use of ultra-thin ﬁlms, opens new
perspectives for the design of oxide supported metal particles.
In a DFT study of Pd and Au atoms adsorbed on the
MgO(100) surface or on MgO/Mo(100) ultra-thin ﬁlms16 a
completely diﬀerent behaviour was observed. While Pd ad-
sorption (energy, geometry, net charge, etc.) is very similar on
MgO(100) and MgO/Mo(100) thin ﬁlms, Au exhibits a com-
pletely diﬀerent character on MgO(100) or on MgO/Mo(100).
First of all, while on MgO(100) the Au atoms prefer to adsorb
on top of the oxide anions, on MgO/Mo(100) the situation is
reversed, and Au prefers to bind to Mg cations or in the four-
fold hollow sites. This change in adsorption site is accompanied
by a change in the strength of the interaction and, most
important, in the nature of the adsorbate. Accurate EPR
experiments in UHV have shown that Au atoms deposited
on MgO(100) are neutral and have the 6s level singly occupied,
thus resulting in a typical EPR signal.180 However, when the
Au atom is adsorbed on MgO/Mo(100) ultra-thin ﬁlms, several
indications point to the formation of a negatively charged
species, Au. On the theory side this charging is supported
by a number of evidences such as the density of states, the
Bader charges, the occurrence of a strong polaronic distortion
of the MgO substrate, etc.193 This charging eﬀect, originally
suggested for MgO/Mo(100) ﬁlms, has later been extended and
proven experimentally for MgO/Ag(100) ﬁlms.194
The use of an Ag support is due to the fact that, thanks to a
better lattice mismatch, it is easier to grow good quality 2 or
3 ML ﬁlms of MgO on Ag(100) than on Mo(100). The
deposition of low amounts of Au atoms on 3 ML MgO/
Ag(100) ﬁlms has been studied with low-temperature STM
and results in a special ordering of the deposited atoms. This
eﬀect has been explained with the repulsive interactions be-
tween the negatively charged Au adatoms, an eﬀect which is
absent for Pd. Another convincing piece of evidence in favor
of the occurrence of a charge transfer comes from the special

shape of the STM image as shown in Fig. 20. Recently Repp
et al.,195 using the tip of an STM, have been able to selectively
charge Au atoms deposited on NaCl/Cu(111) ultra-thin ﬁlms
and transform them into Au anions. The most direct proof of
the formation of a negatively charged gold atom by injection
of one electron is provided by the very diﬀerent appearance of
the STM images of Au0 and Au species. In particular, while
neutral gold appears as a big bright spot, charged gold has a
diﬀerent proﬁle with an about 0.5 A
˚ smaller protrusion and a
bright central region surrounded by a dark depression. The
proﬁle of the image exhibits a ‘‘sombrero’’ eﬀect typical of
negatively charged atoms on conducting substrates. The origin
of this sombrero shape of the STM image is that the
depression arises from two related eﬀects, the transfer of
electrons from metal free-electron states into more localized
states of an electronegative adsorbate, and the subsequent
screening of this transferred charge by the conduction elec-
trons.196 The STM images of Au atoms on MgO/Ag(100)
exhibit the sombrero shape typical of negatively charged
species; this is not the case for the neutral Pd atoms (see
Fig. 20). Simulated STM images obtained from DFT calcula-
tions194 using the Tersoﬀ–Hamann approach,123 clearly show
that the sombrero shape appears only for Au and not for
Au0, further corroborating the fact that a charge transfer has
occurred. The main diﬀerence between the experiment by
Repp et al. on NaCl/Cu(111)195 and those of Sterrer et al.
on MgO/Ag(100)194 is that in the ﬁrst case charging has been
obtained by electron injection from the STM tip on an
individual Au atom while in the second case the process is
spontaneous, and occurs for all atoms deposited on the oxide
ﬁlm. The practical implications are clear. The question be-
comes why the charge transfer is spontaneous in some cases
and not in others, and how does the charge ﬂow from the
metal single crystal support to the deposited atom across an
insulating ﬁlm? The general belief is that charging occurs by
direct electron tunnelling through the ultra-thin insulating
layer when some special conditions are met.15,16,133,197 The
mechanism is similar to that described by Cabrera and Mott198
for the oxidation of metals: the presence of an adsorbate (gold
in this case) with empty states which fall below the Fermi level
of the metal support generates a potential which induces
electron tunnelling through the thin insulating ﬁlm.
The above described phenomenon of electron tunnelling
and charge transfer to adsorbed species is not restricted to Au
atoms. The same eﬀect is expected for molecules with strong
electron-acceptor character such as NO2.199 Potentially, the
most interesting consequence of the spontaneous charge trans-
fer is the possibility to prepare ensembles of supported metal
particles whose properties can be tuned by changing the

thickness of the oxide ﬁlm. In fact, the extent of tunnelling
(hence of charging) is expected to depend directly on the
thickness of the oxide ﬁlm: beyond a given thickness, typically
10 ML, the behaviour of a bulk oxide surface should be
recovered. This aspect has been explored both theoretically
and experimentally. In DFT simulations181 Au clusters con-
taining 8, 16 or 20 metal atoms have been deposited on 2 to
7 ML MgO ﬁlms on Mo(100) and compared with those of the
corresponding
clusters
in
gas-phase
or
deposited
on
MgO(100). Au20 on MgO(100) keeps the same tetrahedral
shape it has in gas-phase as indicated in Fig. 21; the only
change is that while a planar, two-dimensional (2D) gas-phase
isomer is less stable by 1.9 eV than the tetrahedral isomer, this
energy diﬀerence is reduced to 1.2 eV on MgO(100) due to the
fact that a 2D cluster has a larger contact area with the oxide
support hence a larger adhesion energy (see Fig. 21). Still, the
MgO–Au interface bond is not large enough to change the
cluster structure in favor of the planar 2D isomer. The
situation is opposite when one considers a 2 ML MgO/
Mo(100) ﬁlm: here the order of stability is reversed, with the
ﬂat 2D Au20 preferred by 3.3 eV compared to the 3D structure.
The origin of the change in shape of the Au20 cluster on
MgO(100) and MgO/Mo(100) ﬁlms is the occurrence of a
charge transfer from the Mo substrate to the Au cluster on the
thin ﬁlm. The charge localizes at the Au–MgO interface,
and strongly reinforces the Au–MgO interaction by about
1 eV atom1 thus favoring the structural cross-over. The eﬀect
seems to vanish as the thickness of the MgO ﬁlm increases, as
the overlap of the Mo and Au cluster wave functions
decreases.181
This eﬀect has been observed experimentally.197 Au atoms
have been deposited at low temperature on ultra-thin (3 ML)
and thicker (8 ML) MgO ﬁlms on Ag(100). Aggregation and
cluster formation has been stimulated by thermal annealing up
to 300 K. The STM images clearly show that on the 3 ML ﬁlm
extended 2D gold islands are formed, whereas 3D Au particles
appear on the 8 ML ﬁlms, Fig. 22. The consequence of this
result for catalysis and in general for cluster properties is
evident. By tuning the thickness of the oxide ﬁlm, one can
stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal
particle with consequent change in shape and electronic
properties. The 2D gold islands produced on the ultra-thin
MgO ﬁlms diﬀer from their counterparts supported on
thick ﬁlms or bulk MgO both in electronic and geometric
structure. In principle, this could lead to markedly diﬀerent
chemical and catalytic properties as recently suggested by
DFT calculations.200
The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a
supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the
design of new catalytic materials. There are several parameters
which can be modiﬁed in a desired way, such as the type of
oxide material (ionic or covalent, reducible or non-reducible,
etc.), the nature of metal/oxide interface (strong or weak
adhesion, lattice mismatch, position of metal Fermi level with
respect to valence and conduction band of the oxide, charge
transfer at the interface, etc.), or the thickness of the oxide ﬁlm
(from one to several ML). Therefore, it becomes important to
identify the essential ‘‘ingredients’’ for the occurrence of the
spontaneous charging. So far, experimental evidence of the
formation of charged clusters on a thin oxide ﬁlm have been
reported only for a few cases, and always restricted to Au.
Beside the already mentioned example of Au clusters on MgO/
Ag(100) ﬁlms, signs of the formation of anionic nanoaggre-
gates have been observed for small Au clusters deposited on
Al2O3/NiAl ﬁlms134 (see above). It is possible that this me-
chanism is active also for other supported gold nanostructures,
such as those obtained in Goodman’s group on TiOx/Mo
ﬁlms,201 but a direct evidence is still lacking. On the theoretical
side, while the occurrence of the charge transfer has been
conﬁrmed independently by other groups,202 this is limited to
ﬁlms of ionic materials such as MgO and alumina. The reasons
become clear if one analyzes under which circumstances the
electron tunnelling may occur. The basic requirement is that
the Fermi level of the metal single crystal substrate lies above
the empty states of the adsorbate. Stated diﬀerently, the work
function of the metal/oxide interface must be smaller than the
electron aﬃnity of the deposited metal atom or metal particle.
The gold atom has the highest electron aﬃnity of any metal in
the periodic table, comparable to the halogen atoms, 2.3 eV,
and this is the reason why a charge transfer has been observed
for Au and not for Pd (Pd has an EA of only 1.3 eV). Thus, an

adsorbate with a relatively high electron aﬃnity is the ﬁrst
condition, but not the only one.
The other essential aspect is the value of the work function
for the metal/oxide interface. Oxide thin ﬁlms induce a sig-
niﬁcant change in the work function F of the metal support. In
general this is related to the charge transfer at the interface
between the oxide and the metal. For instance, SiO2 ﬁlms are
bound to the Mo(112) substrate by an oxygen atom, which
leads to a charge transfer from the metal to the electronegative
oxygen atoms and to a surface dipole whose sign raises F.203
The classical picture proposed by Kingdom and Langmuir
(1923)204 and by Gurney (1935)205 is that F increases (de-
creases) for a negative (positive) adsorbate on a metal since an
image charge forms into the bulk metal giving rise to a dipole
layer which the emitted electron must pass through.206 The
work function of the Mo(112) metal, 4.3 eV according to DFT
calculations, becomes 4.7 eV upon growth of the silica ﬁlm.203
Thus, the deposition of the oxide layer makes it harder to
remove electrons from the interface and the Fermi level moves
down, below the empty levels of the adsorbate. Charging on
this substrate is neither expected nor observed.
Films of ionic materials such as MgO or NaCl, on the
contrary, induce a substantial reduction of the work func-
tion.203,207 This is not due to charge transfers at the interface,
since the anions are fully reduced and unable to take more
charge from the metal. Actually, a small charge transfer occurs
in the opposite direction, from the ﬁlm to the metal substrate,
but this is much too low to explain the observed work function
changes. The eﬀect on the work function is large because of a
mechanism of electrostatic nature, also called ‘‘compression’’
eﬀect.208 The oxide layer reduces the amount of electronic
charge that spills over from the metal surface, the metal
electrons are polarized towards the surface, and the work
function decreases. In MgO/Ag(100) this reduction is 1.2 eV;
in MgO/Mo(100), where the adhesion is stronger and the
interface distance shorter, the eﬀect is more pronounced and
the reduction of F is about 2 eV.203 The modiﬁcation of the
metal/oxide work function is thus an essential parameter to
determine the properties of deposited metal atoms, and ways
to tune the work function in a controlled way are highly
desirable. There is another, essential eﬀect which favours the
occurrence of a charge transfer: this is the polaronic distortion
of the oxide ﬁlm which accompanies the formation of a
charged species. This distortion is quite substantial and DFT
calculations show that when it is not allowed, for instance by
freezing the coordinates of the oxide ﬁlm during geometry
optimization, the Au ad-atom remains neutral.194,195 It is
likely that this eﬀect is very pronounced on ultra-thin ﬁlms,
of 1–3 atomic layers, and decreases for thicker ﬁlms, providing
another example of the special character of this new class of
materials.

Conclusions
The use of oxide ﬁlms provides a versatile strategy for the
study of model systems in catalysis. The thickness of the oxide
ﬁlm may be used as a control parameter on one hand to design
and investigate materials in their own right whose properties
may open interesting routes for catalyst design and on the
other hand as models of dispersed metal catalysts on bulk
oxide surfaces.
Clearly, it is not only the oxide ﬁlm thickness that needs to
be considered but also the properties of the metal support the
ﬁlm is grown upon as well as the property of the metal
deposited on the ﬁlm.
Research in this area, that has a lot in common with the
investigation of metal–semiconductor contacts—so important
in device physics—is only at its beginning in connection with
the design of catalyst properties. Given the opportunities
opening up through techniques such as atomic layer deposi-
tion (ALD) there is the chance to even move from those
esoteric model studies to studies of more technical relevance.
