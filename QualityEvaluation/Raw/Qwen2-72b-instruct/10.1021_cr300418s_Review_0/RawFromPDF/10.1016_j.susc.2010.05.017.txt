Low-dimensional nanoscale oxide-metal hybrid structures have been fabricated by decoration of a vicinal
noble metal surface, Pd(1,1,17), by 1-D and 2-D Mn-oxide nanowires and nanostripes. STM and LEED
demonstrate that highly ordered superlattices of Mn-oxide nanostructures can be obtained. The coupling of
the oxide nanophases to the metal steps and terraces leads to a mesoscopic stabilization of the step–terrace
morphology thus creating nearly perfect nanopatterned oxide systems.

Nanoscale oxide structures ﬁnd widespread use as active and
passive elements in many diverse areas of modern nanoscience, such
as in oxide nanoelectronics [1], nanocatalysis [2,3], or as model
systems in fundamental studies of the emergent properties of novel
low-dimensional materials [4]. The fabrication of nanoscale structures
is typically achieved by following one of the two routes: the top-down
or the bottom-up approach. While the top-down routes retain the
lithographic design motifs by making use of tools such as nanolitho-
graphic techniques and scanning probe microscopies, the bottom-up
methods encompass self-assembly processes and templated synthe-
sis. In the latter case, vicinal metal surfaces, which provide regular
arrays of monatomic steps that may act as nucleation centers, have
been employed as templates for engineering patterned nanostruc-
tures by directed growth in physical vapor deposition procedures [5–
7]. Here we report the creation of superlattices of low-dimensional
oxide nanosystems, in the form of oxide nanowires and nanostripes,
by using a vicinal metal surface as a template for directed self-
assembly of an oxide phase of a different metal: the systems of study
in this work are manganese oxides patterned by a Pd(1,1,17) surface,
which is a vicinal of Pd(100).
Vicinal, i.e. high Miller index, metal surfaces may be visualized in
the ideal case as a regular staircase of low-index terrace planes
separated by monatomic steps [8], which create a superlattice of step
structures acting as patterning centers. In reality, however, vicinal
surfaces resemble rarely the ideal picture and, in particular for larger
terrace widths, a regular step–terrace pattern is difﬁcult to achieve,
resulting in surfaces with a wide distribution of terrace widths and
irregular step edges. This is in part due to the relatively weak repulsive
step–step interaction energies, which are responsible for producing
the step ordering, and in part to the propensity of vicinal surfaces
to facet into more stable low-index conﬁgurations [9]. Here we
show that the decoration of the metal step edges and terraces by
pseudomorphic oxide nanolayers leads to a mesoscopic stabilization
of the step morphology and to the creation of highly ordered
superlattices of oxide nanostructures. Using this design approach,
we are able to prepare ordered arrays of one-dimensional (1-D) Mn-
oxide nanowires pseudomorphically coupled to the step edges of the
stepped Pd(1,1,17) surface, and of two-dimensional (2-D) Mn-oxide
nanostripes incommensurate overlayers covering the terraces of this
stepped Pd surface. The formation of a particular oxide phase can be
tuned by appropriate choices of the Mn coverage, substrate
temperature and oxygen chemical potential.
The Mn-oxide nanostructures reported here have been atomically
characterized by STM and LEED in a multi-task custom-designed
system as described previously [10]. The Pd(1,1,17) surface, which has
been used as template in the directed growth experiments in this
work, consists of (100)-oriented terraces ∼8.5 atoms (23.4 Å) wide
separated by monatomic steps exposing (111)-type microfacets.
Fig. 1a shows a schematic model of the ideal stepped surface, which
can be compared to the experimental STM image of the clean Pd
(1,1,17) surface in Fig. 1b. We notice that the step edges of the clean Pd
surface display only short straight sections (b50 Å) separated by kinks
in a random sequence, and that the terraces are irregular and have a
large width distribution (Fig. 1e, red bar diagram), centered around
a terrace width of ∼23–24 Å, as expected for a (1,1,17) vicinal Pd
surface. Deposition of 0.1 monolayer (ML — as deﬁned with respect to
the atom density of the bare substrate surface) of Mn atoms at 300 K,
followed by oxidation in 1×10−8 mbar O2 at 470 K results in a regular
decoration of the Pd step edges by monatomic rows of MnOx
structures, which are clearly recognized by the brighter chemical

contrast in the STM images of Fig. 1(c–d). The morphology of the steps
has changed signiﬁcantly as a result of the decoration process with
MnOx rows, displaying now perfectly straight step edges extended
over many hundreds of Ångström (Fig. 1c), although the terrace width
distribution is not much narrower (see the green bar diagram in
Fig. 1e). The high-resolution STM image of Fig. 1d allows us to deter-
mine the structural details of the Mn-oxide nanowires: the mon-
atomic MnOx rows are attached to the Pd step atoms in a
pseudomorphic 1-D (×1) structure, i.e. displaying the same lattice
constant as the Pd substrate (aPd=2.75 Å) along the step edge direction
as indicated in Fig. 1d. On the terraces a p(2×2) superstructure is
recognized, which is due to a chemisorbed oxygen overlayer formed as a
result of the oxidation process. The Mn 2p3/2 XPS spectrum, recorded
with Al Kα radiation in a different system and shown in Fig. 1f, conﬁrms
that the Mn atoms are oxidized: the Mn 2p3/2 core-level, which
due to ﬁnal state effects displays a complex structure [11], is shifted

by ∼0.8 eV to higher binding energy with respect to metallic Mn
adatom species, a clear indication of an oxidized Mn nanostructure.
1-D oxidic nanowire superstructures, albeit less well-ordered and
less regular, have been reported previously for monatomic NiOx lines
decorating the steps of a vicinal Rh(111) surface [12]. They have been
interpreted on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calcula-
tions in terms of a formal NiO2 stoichiometry, i.e. each Ni step adatom
is coordinated to four oxygen atoms, two at the lower and two at the
upper step edge as shown schematically in Fig. 1a, right hand side. The
Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectrum displayed a chemical shift of 0.7 eV to higher
binding energy between the oxidized NiO2 nanowires and metallic Ni
adatoms [12], which is very similar to the chemical shift observed
here in the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum of Fig. 1f. It is thus most natural to
associate the 1-D Mn-oxide structures on stepped Pd surfaces with
nanowires of formal MnO2 stoichiometry.
The pseudomorphic coupling of the MnO2 lines to the Pd step
edges creates artiﬁcial quasi-1-D oxide–metal hybrid structures with
Mn–Mn distances close to metallic but strained with respect to oxidic
Mn phases (dMn–Mn in Mn metal is 2.73 Å, in oxides typicallyN3 Å).
The step morphology at the Pd(1,1,17) surface is signiﬁcantly
modiﬁed by the MnO2 decoration, in that step edge ﬂuctuations and
kink formation become suppressed and straight step edges are
stabilized over remarkably long distances. The here fabricated 1-D
Mn-oxide — Pd hybrid structures may be interesting model systems
for studying low-dimensional electronic and magnetic behavior and
for nanocatalytic applications. Preliminary experiments indicate
indeed that these oxide–metal hybrid surfaces are highly reactive
towards residual gases suggesting a high catalytic activity for e.g.
oxidation reactions.
Different oxide nanostructures, in form of oxide nanostripes, can be
fabricated by completely covering the terraces of the vicinal Pd(1,1,17)
surface by a Mn-oxide wetting layer, as depicted in Fig. 2. The
STM images of Fig. 2(a–b), recorded after deposition of 0.75 ML Mn at
room temperature (RT) followed by oxidation in 5×10−8 mbar O2 at
800 K, show a well-ordered step superlattice with terraces covered by a
c(4×2) MnOx superstructure. The oxide overlayer stabilizes a step
morphology with straight edges and regular terrace widths, creating a
surface with perfect regularity and high surface order. The latter is
highlighted by the sharp LEED pattern in Fig. 2c and the narrow terrace
width distribution displayed in Fig. 2d. It is remarkable that the mean
terrace width of this c(4×2) MnOx covered Pd surface is expanded to
∼28–29 Å: this corresponds to adding two atomic Pd rows to each
terrace of the (1,1,17) surface, thus faceting the (1,1,17) into a (1,1,21)
surface. The faceting of vicinal metal surfaces is not uncommon and
has been reported, for example, for the Rh(553) surface under the
inﬂuence of oxygen [13]. We note that the overall (macroscopic)
orientation of the original vicinal surface is maintained after the
faceting by the introduction of multi-atomic steps, as also seen
experimentally. The here observed faceting is driven by the interaction
of the (100)-type terraces with the Mn-oxide overlayer. The c(4×2)
MnOx overlayer structure has also been observed on the ﬂat Pd(100)
surface and has been rationalized, using a combination of several
experimental techniques and DFT calculations, as a MnO(100)-type
monolayer with a c(4×2) superlattice of Mn vacancies, thereby

yielding a formal Mn3O4 stoichiometry [14]. It has been suggested that
the formation of this Mn vacancy defect lattice is a mechanism for the
relaxation of epitaxial strain, which is caused by the large lattice
mismatch between the MnO and the Pd lattices (∼14%). The step edges
of the vicinal substrate surface provide additional means for the
relaxation of overlayer strain, and this is at the root of the formation of
this perfectly well-ordered c(4×2) −Mn3O4 covered Pd(1,1,21)
surface. We note parenthetically that on the ﬂat Pd(100) surface the
c(4×2)−Mn3O4 overlayer forms ordered areas of only limited size,
which are separated by disordered regions as a result of residual
interface strain [14]. The detailed discussion of the stress relief in
the c(4×2)−Mn3O4 nanostripes on the stepped Pd surface is beyond
the scope of this paper and will be the subject of a forthcoming
publication.
As seen in Fig. 2b, the terraces of the Pd(1,1,21) facet can
accommodate three primitive unit cells of the c(4×2)−Mn3O4
structure. Experimentally we observe that the vicinal Pd substrate
has to be fully covered by the Mn-oxide overlayer in order to establish
the exceptional surface order as apparent in Fig. 2. We conjecture
therefore that both the faceting transition and the stabilization of the
step–terrace morphology into a superlattice with high perfection are
driven by the match of the Mn3O4 overlayer lattice to the substrate
terrace width and the concomitant minimization of the electronic
(bonding) and elastic (strain) energy contributions. DFT calculations
with hybrid functionals predicted a ferromagnetic ground state for the
strained c(4×2) Mn3O4 overlayer on Pd(100)[14]. The Mn3O4
nanostripes on the vicinal Pd surface may thus provide an interesting
system to investigate the role of lateral conﬁnement and strain relief
on the magnetic properties of low-dimensional oxide structures.
The chemical potential of oxygen as a growth variable during the
oxidation step of the preparation procedure crucially determines the
atomic structure of the particular oxide phase formed. Deposition of
0.75 ML Mn onto Pd(1,1,17) at RT and oxidation in 5×10−8 mbar O2
at 500 K (as opposed to 800 K in the case of the c(4×2) structure),
i.e. applying a higher chemical potential of oxygen, results in the
formation of nanostripes of MnOx with a p(2×1) structure covering
the terraces of the Pd vicinal surface. As apparent from Fig. 3, the
superlattice of oxide nanostripes is again established with high
quality: the sharp LEED pattern (Fig. 3c) and the narrow terrace width
distribution (Fig. 3d) give evidence of a well-established long-range
order of the step–terrace morphology. The analysis of the terrace
widths yields a mean width of ∼28–29 Å, corresponding again to a
(1,1,21) orientation of the average Pd substrate surface. The p(2×1)
MnOx phase thus also appears to stabilize the (1,1,21) Pd facet, if a full
oxide overlayer coverage is established. The high-resolution STM
image of Fig. 3b indicates that three p(2×1) unit cells can be placed
across each substrate terrace. The atomic structure of the p(2×1)
MnOx nanostripes is presently still unresolved, but detailed inspection
of high-resolution STM images recorded with different tunneling
conditions suggests a square symmetry of the basic oxide lattice [15],
as e.g. in a buckled MnO(100)-type structure. It is clear, however, that
also in the p(2×1) MnOx case the oxide overlayer provides a highly
stabilizing agent for the step superlattice geometry thus creating an
array of highly ordered oxide nanostripes.

As demonstrated here for Mn-oxides on Pd, the decoration of
vicinal metal surfaces by oxide nanostructures provides a successful
route to fabricate well-ordered superlattices of low-dimensional
oxide systems. The structures created constitute novel hybrid
materials with as yet unexplored physical and chemical properties.
The physical origin of the mesoscopic stabilization of the regular
step–terrace morphology of the vicinal metal surfaces by decoration
with oxide nanostructures is presumably due to a twofold effect: the
substrate steps become rigid due to the coupling to pseudomorphic
oxide line structures, and particular terrace widths become preferred
thanks to the interfacial matching with the lattice of 2-D oxide
wetting layers. The provision of strain release at the step edges may
provide additional stabilization for particular oxide nanophases. The
here described route of atomic scale engineering of nanopatterned
oxide surfaces may be applied to a variety of metal–oxide hybrid
combinations, thus creating new avenues for the study of physical
and chemical phenomena at the nanoscale.
