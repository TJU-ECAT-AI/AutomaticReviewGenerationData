Abstract
The dehydroiodination of 1-iodobutane has been investigated over two different nanocrystalline MgO samples. The reaction with clean
MgO takes place at temperatures as low as 100 ◦C. However, a temperature of 300 ◦C or higher is required for catalytic dehydroiodination to
take place. At lower temperatures the reaction stops after the maximum degree of surface modiﬁcation with iodine is reached. It was found
by XPS that at all temperatures iodination is limited to the surface and no bulk MgI2 is formed. The weight gain never exceeds 22%, which
corresponds to 3.7% MgO conversion. In accordance with this conclusion, the textures of the samples after reaction are similar to those of
the initial MgO. The surface iodination leads to a change in reaction mechanism: from concerted E2 elimination on initial MgO to stage E1
elimination. The secondary process of 2-iodobutane formation over iodinated samples was also established.

1. Introduction
Nanocrystalline alkaline earth metal oxides attract sig-
niﬁcant attention as effective chemisorbents for such toxic
gases as NO2, SO2, SO3, and HCl and chlorinated and
phosphorous-containing compounds [1–9]. For example,
it has been shown that CCl4 reacts with nanocrystalline
aerogel-prepared MgO (AP-MgO) at 500 ◦C according to
reaction (1).
2MgO + CCl4 →2MgCl2 + CO2.

We recently studied in detail the destructive adsorption of
several chlorobutanes over AP-MgO at 50–400 ◦C [10,11].
It has been found that the chlorobutanes are subjected to
selective dehydrochlorination with HCl abstraction and for-
mation of a mixture of butene isomers. Hydrogen chloride
formed in this process reacted with nanocrystalline MgO
to yield a new phase of MgCl2. Another important fea-
ture of 1-chlorobutane dehydrochlorination over AP-MgO
is the signiﬁcant changes in the texture of the material. It

was found that a 50–70% MgO transformation into MgCl2
leads to a drop in the surface area from about 400 m2/g to
20–40 m2/g, so that the pores present in the initial oxide
are mostly ﬁlled with magnesium chloride. Still, despite this
more than 10-fold drop in the surface area, the formation of
MgCl2 results in a 5-fold increase in the catalytic activity.
Similar tendencies were observed for dehydrobromination
of 1-bromobutane as well [10].
In addition, nanocrystalline MgO itself and MgO modi-
ﬁed with vanadium oxide were found to be efﬁcient catalysts
in one-step selective oxidative dehydrogenation of butane
to butadiene in the presence of oxygen and iodine [12].
Molecular iodine shifts the equilibrium of the dehydro-
genation reactions toward reaction products and makes it
possible to achieve high butane conversion with high se-
lectivity for butadiene. However, the iodine addition to the
feed leads to the formation of iodinated organic compounds,
including 1-iodobutane. The concentration of such iodi-
nated compounds may reach 10–15 wt% of the butadiene
obtained [13]. This problem makes investigation of iodine
regeneration from iodinated organic compounds very im-
portant.

In the current publication we report on the reaction of
1-iodobutane with nanocrystalline MgO prepared by two
different techniques. There are two reasons to gain an under-
standing of the 1-iodobutane system: (1) to establish whether
general observations for chloro- and bromo-derivativescarry
over to the iodo-system, leading to a better understanding of
the overall reaction, and (2) to establish whether iodobutanes
are likely intermediates in the dehydrogenation of butane
over nanocrystalline MgO in the presence of iodine as an
additive,
2. Experimental
The following nanocrystalline oxides were used in the ex-
periments: AP-MgO (410 m2/g) and CP-MgO (280 m2/g).
CP-MgO was obtained by decomposition of Mg(OH)2 pre-
pared by overnight hydration of commercial MgO (Aldrich)
in reﬂuxing water followed by evacuation at 500 ◦C. Prepa-
ration of AP-MgO has been described in detail elsewhere
[14]. In short, this includes preparation of Mg(OCH3)2 via
reaction of Mg with CH3OH, dilution of Mg(OCH3)2 with
toluene, formation of Mg(OH)2 with water addition, super-
critical drying of the Mg(OH)2 suspension, and conversion
of Mg(OH)2 to AP-MgO via heat treating under a dynamic
vacuum at 500 ◦C overnight.
The reaction was performed in a ﬂow reactor equipped
with a McBane spring balance, which made it possible to
monitor changes in the catalyst weight during the reaction
with a 10−4 g precision. 1-Iodobutane was introduced into
the reactor by saturation of the argon ﬂow with 1-iodobutane
its vapor at room temperature to give a 2% C4H9I concen-
tration in the feed. The volume ﬂow rate was 2 l/h, and the
catalyst loading was varied within 0.05–0.1 g. The product
composition after the reactor was analyzed by gas chro-
matography. Prior to each run the samples were activated in
the argon ﬂow at 500 ◦C for 30 min for removal of adsorbed
water.
The iodine and carbon contents were determined by el-
emental analysis and X-ray ﬂuorescence spectral analysis
(XFSA) on a VRA-20 analyzer with an external standard
with a relative error of 10%.
XPS studies of AP-MgO after reaction with 1-iodobutane
were performed with a VG ESCALAB (VG Scientiﬁc) elec-
tron spectrometer. The samples were attached to the holder
with a conducting vacuum-stable two-sided sticking tape in
air. Prior to the spectroscopic experiments the samples were
evacuated in a pretreatment chamber down to 10−7 mbar.
Then they were moved into the analyzer chamber with a
basis vacuum better than 10−9 mbar. The main background
gases were CO, CO2, and H2O.
Studies of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K were carried out
with an ASAP 2400 instrument (Micromeritics). The N2 ad-
sorption isotherms were analyzed by the BET method and
the comparative plot method [16,17] based on a comparison
of the variation of adsorption uptake of experimental ad-
sorption isotherm (EI) with a reference adsorption isotherm
(RI) for a nonporous sample (generally it is analogous to a
more widely used αS method [18]). The isotherm reported
in Refs. [14,15] was used as the RI.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Gravimetric measurements
It has been found that the reaction of nanocrystalline AP-
MgO with 1-iodobutane in the temperature range of 100–
400 ◦C is accompanied by an increase in the sample weight.
The kinetic graphs of the weight change presented in Fig. 1
indicate that the maximum weight gain depends on the reac-
tion temperature. The smallest gain (4.1 wt%) was observed
at 400 ◦C (Fig. 1, curve 5). In this case the maximum weight
is achieved already after 40 min on stream and does not
change after that. The maximum weight grew as the reac-
tion temperature was decreased; the highest value of 22.5%
was obtained at 200 ◦C (Fig. 1, curve 4).
The chromatographic analysis of the outlet gases after the
reactor indicated the presence of three butene isomers. This
observation brought us to the conclusion that HI is abstracted
from 1-iodobutane, and its following reaction with MgO
leads to the weight gain. We believe that, in this case, similar
to the reactions of 1-chlorobutane and 1-bromobutane over
AP-MgO that result in the formation of MgCl2 and MgBr2,
respectively [10], the weight gain is due to the formation of
MgI2. Since the molecular weight of magnesium iodide is
approximately 7 times larger than that of MgO, we could
expect a 600% weight gain if the oxide were completely
converted into iodide. However, the actual weight gain was
just above 20%. If the MgO conversion to MgI2 is the only

cause of the weight gain, this corresponds to a 3.7% con-
version. It is notable that nearly 60% conversion of MgO to
MgCl2 was observed during the reaction of AP-MgO with
1-chlorobutane under similar conditions [10]. This indicates
that the MgO conversion to MgI2 is mostly limited to the
surface. This is due most likely to a much larger size of I−
ions in comparison with Cl−and Br−, which hinders io-
dine diffusion into the MgO lattice and substitution of the
lattice oxide for iodine. This conclusion is substantiated by
the XRD results. MgI2 was not observed by XRD in any of
the AP-MgO samples after reaction with 1-iodobutane. This
means that after reaction iodine is present only in the form
of surface compounds, and no bulk MgI2 is formed.
Fig. 2 presents the weight changes in an AP-MgO sam-
ple ﬁrst subjected to reaction with 1-iodobutane at 200 ◦C
(curve 1) and then heat-treated in an argon ﬂow at 500 ◦C
(curve 2). It is clear that the calcination in argon results in
the complete loss of the 22 wt% gained during the reaction
with 1-iodobutane.
3.2. Activity and selectivity of MgO in dehydroiodination of
1-iodobutane
Dehydroiodination of 1-iodobutane over AP-MgO was
studied in the temperature range of 100–400 ◦C. Fig. 3
presents experimental dependence of the 1-iodobutane con-
version over AP-MgO as a function of time on stream at
different temperatures. At 100 ◦C the percentage conversion
decreases from the initial 45% to nearly zero in 3 h (Fig. 3,
curve 1). The same tendency is observed at 200 ◦C (curve 2).
In this case, the conversion gradually decreases to 4–5% in
6 h on stream. However, a temperature increase to 300 ◦C re-
sults in stabilization of the 1-iodobutane conversion at 69%
(curve 3). Further increase in the reaction temperature leads
to conversion growth to nearly 100% at 400 ◦C.

The activities of AP-MgO and CP-MgO in dehydroiod-
ination of 1-iodobutane are compared in Fig. 4. The graph
shows that the activity of AP-MgO is higher than that of
CP-MgO at any temperature studied. Furthermore, at 200 ◦C

droiodination activity of AP-MgO in comparison with CP-
MgO correlates well with earlier data on destructive ad-
sorption of various compounds [7–9,22,23]. However, reac-
tion rates normalized to the surface areas of materials mea-
sured after reaction at 300 ◦C were found to be very similar:
0.113 mmol/(hm2) for CP-MgO and 0.117 mmol/(h m2)
for AP-MgO.
As noted above, dehydroiodination of 1-iodobutane over
AP-MgO yields a mixture of three butene isomers: 1-butene,
cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene. Mechanistically, in contact
elimination, as in the liquid phase, it is necessary to dis-
tinguish between three main possibilities [24]. The reaction
following the E1 mechanism starts with X−abstraction, gen-
erating a carbocation, which has a certain lifetime and can
be subjected to rearrangement before it loses a proton in the
second step. In the case of the E1cB mechanism the reac-
tion also consists of two distinct steps, beginning with the
proton abstraction. The E2 mechanism covers a broad range
between the two, with H+ and X−removed simultaneously
in a concerted process. Its essential feature is that the energy
process has only one maximum.
If no rearrangement of the carbocation takes place, which
is typical for the concerted E2 reaction mechanism, 1-butene
should be the only product resulting from the dehydrochlo-
rination of 1-chlorobutane. It was important to determine
whether the surface modiﬁcation during the reaction re-
sulted in any signiﬁcant changes in the mechanism of the
HI elimination. Earlier we observed that changes in the
phase composition of the catalyst affected the distribution
of the butene isomers formed during dehydrochlorination of
1-chlorobutane over AP-MgO [10]. During the ﬁrst minutes
of the reaction with 1-chlorobutane when the catalysts con-
sisted mostly from the MgO phase, 1-butene was formed
with nearly 100% selectivity. The formation of magnesium
chloride resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the selectiv-
ity toward cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene. This observation
was explained by a change in the reaction mechanism. It was
suggested that the HCl abstraction over MgO follows the E2
mechanism. Meanwhile, the E1 abstraction mechanism pre-
dominates over MgCl2 formed in the reaction of MgO with
HCl. This mechanism involves the formation of intermedi-
ate carbocation that is subjected to fast isomerization to yield
three butene isomers.
Changes in the relative selectivity for these three iso-
mers with time on stream at 300 and 400 ◦C are presented in
Fig. 5. At 300 ◦C the 1-butene selectivity at the ﬁfth minute
after the start of the reaction is nearly 100%. Within 2 h
it decreases by a factor of 4 and stabilizes at 23%. Mean-
while the selectivities for cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene
reach 50 and 27%, respectively, and do not change further
more. A comparison of these data with the weight gain curve
(Fig. 1, curve 3) led us to an obvious conclusion that these
changes in the selectivity are due entirely to modiﬁcation
of the MgO surface in the course of reaction. During the
ﬁrst minutes HI abstraction from 1-iodobutane takes place
on a nearly clean MgO surface and follows a concerted E2

mechanism that yields only 1-butene. Full iodination of the
surface leads to predomination of the E1 reaction mech-
anism when all three isomers are formed in comparable
amounts. Similar behavior has been observed elsewhere for
dehydrochlorination of 1-chlorobutane over AP-MgO [10].
It is also notable that the amounts of cis-2-butene formed
in the reaction are always higher than those of the trans-
isomer. This observation seems to contradict the thermody-
namics. However, such behavior is often observed in contact
eliminations [10,24,25]. It can be attributed to natural steric
limitations on the surface that hinder the formation of trans-
2-butene.
Besides the dehydroiodination reaction, a secondary re-
action of HI with butene that results in the formation of
2-iodobutane has been observed over iodinated MgO. This
reaction results in a decrease in the process selectivity for
butenes. Fig. 6 shows that for both MgO samples the for-
mation of 2-iodobutane starts only after the maximum de-
gree of iodination of the MgO surface is reached and HI no
longer reacts with MgO. It is interesting that at the same tem-
perature (300 ◦C) the selectivity for 2-iodobutane is higher
over CP-MgO than it is over AP-MgO). This observation
can be explained as follows. The atom of iodine, after ab-
straction on the surface magnesium atom (ﬁrst step of stage
E1 mechanism), can react again with carbocation to form
2-iodobutane. The lower selectivity for 2-iodobutane over
AP-MgO indicates that the surface Mg–I bond in the AP
sample is stronger than that in the CP sample. One can con-
clude that the strength of Lewis sites in AP-MgO is higher
in comparison with CP-MgO. This is probably due to the
unique chemistry of nanoscale magnesium oxide.

3.3. Thermodynamic considerations
A thermodynamic estimation of the feasibility of HI ab-
straction from a 1-iodobutane molecule to form 1-butene
[10] indicates that considerable 1-iodobutane conversion
should be expected only at temperatures above 350 ◦C. How-
ever, in the experiments we observed a signiﬁcant conversion
(above 40%) during the ﬁrst minutes, even at 100 ◦C. Sub-
sequent fast decrease of the activity to zero brings us to the
conclusion that at this temperature the HI abstraction from
1-iodobutane is possible only because of the iodination of
magnesium oxide.
C4H9I →C4H8 + HI,

MgO + 2HI →MgI2 + H2O.
(3)
According to the thermodynamic calculations [10], the
equilibrium of reaction (2) should be shifted to the left up
to temperatures well above 300 ◦C, and the HCl abstraction
should occur much more easily. This can be explained by
the fact that the energy gain due to the HI abstraction from
C4H9I is very small because of a small difference in the
energies of C–I and H–I bonds. Meanwhile, reaction (3) is
always thermodynamically favorable in the studied tempera-
ture range, and it can make the HI abstraction possible even
at temperatures below 300 ◦C. However, this results in the
iodination of the MgO surface. After the surface is covered
with an iodide layer, subsequent reaction is very difﬁcult be-
cause of slow iodine diffusion into the MgO nanocrystals.
Because of the thermodynamic restrictions, reaction (2)
should not go by itself at 100 or 200 ◦C, which is observed
experimentally when the 1-iodobutane conversion falls to
nearly zero after some time. At 300 ◦C the thermodynamic

limitations are not as strict, which changes the overall pic-
ture of the process. Magnesium iodide now starts to act as
a dehydroiodination catalyst, providing stable conversion of
1-iodobutane to butenes.
3.4. Adsorption measurements
Adsorption-desorption isotherms for initial AP-MgO and
for samples 3 and 6 are presented in the bottom part of Fig. 7
in regular coordinates. The top part presents the linear parts
of corresponding comparative plots. These isotherms appear
to be typical for AP-MgO and its derivatives [11,19]. As dis-
cussed elsewhere [11,19], the texture of these materials can
be described as a unity of mesoporous aggregates of non-
porous solid particles several nanometers in size.
Changes in the speciﬁc surface areas of MgO after re-
action with 1-iodobutane at different temperatures are pre-
sented in Table 1. Initial AP-MgO is referred to as sample 1.
The samples after reaction with 1-iodobutane at 100, 200,
300, 350, and 400 ◦C are referred to as 2–6, respectively.
Sample 7 is the sample treated at 500 ◦C in an argon ﬂow
after reaction with 1-iodobutane at 200 ◦C.
As the reaction temperature increases, the speciﬁc sur-
face area of the samples calculated by the BET method
gradually decreases from 410 m2/g (starting AP-MgO) to
97 m2/g (after reaction at 400 ◦C). The surface area mea-
sured by the comparative plot method also decreases from
430 to 90 m2/g. As reported above, the weight of the sam-
ples also changes during the reaction (Fig. 1). The ultimate
increase in sample mass related to the initial sample mass,
X, is reported in Table 1.
To follow the change in geometrical surface area one has
to take into account the weight changes. The surface areas

normalized to the weight of the initial AP-MgO are also re-
ported in Table 1. No change in geometrical surface area of
AP-MgO can be seen until the reaction temperature reaches
200 ◦C. At higher temperatures a signiﬁcant drop in the geo-
metrical surface is observed.
These data correlate well with the results of our previous
studies of the 1-chlorobutane reaction with AP-MgO [11].
However, there is also a signiﬁcant difference in the tex-
tural behavior of AP-MgO in these two cases. In the case of
1-chlorobutane almost all pores are ﬁlled with MgCl2 phase
at temperatures above 300 ◦C. Reaction with 1-iodobutane
is accompanied by a decrease in the pore volume of less
than twofold (Table 1). Taking into account a small change
in the sample weight during this reaction, there is no doubt
that bulk MgI2 is not formed. The drop in the surface area
and pore volume appears to result from the sintering of the
nanoparticles in the presence of halogenated compounds.
This sintering occurs also when the reaction is stopped,
but AP-MgO is still treated at elevated temperatures. For ex-
ample, sample 2 after reaction at 200 ◦C was subjected to
treatment at 500 ◦C in the argon ﬂow (sample 7). The de-
crease in surface area and pore volume was even higher than
for sample 6, which was treated only in the reaction with
1-iodobutane. We can conclude here that sintering occurs in
the presence of surface iodine-containing species rather than
because of reaction conditions in the gas phase.
Because of the high atomic weight of iodine, one can
make an estimation of the number of “guest” surface io-
dine species per square nanometer (Table 1), assuming their
molecular weight to be equal to that of iodine atom. The
number of “guest” surface species proved to be in the range
of 2–4 species/nm2 for all samples after reaction. Such low
concentration of the “guest” molecules allows us to assume
that they are molecularly dispersed on the surface. The high-
est concentration of “guest” species was found for sample
3 after reaction with 1-iodobutane at 200 ◦C, which shows
maximum weight gain as well. The surface concentration of
the iodine-containing species decreases as the reaction tem-
perature increases.
Another conﬁrmation of this conclusion comes from
comparative plots (Fig. 7). These plots are linear but have
negative intercepts that increase in absolute value with
increasing concentration of “guest” surface species (Ta-
ble 1). As discussed earlier [19], the most probable ori-
gin of the negative intercepts on comparative plots is the
presence of molecularly dispersed modiﬁers. This is most
likely the exact case for AP-MgO treated with 1-iodobu-
tane.
4. XPS, XFSA, and elemental analysis data
As mentioned above, the XRD study of MgO samples af-
ter reaction with 1-iodobutane did not reveal the presence of
the MgI2 phase. Nevertheless, the results of the adsorption
experiments and analysis of reaction products indicate that
the MgO surface is subjected to signiﬁcant chemical modi-
ﬁcation. To analyze the causes of the MgO weight gain dur-
ing reaction with 1-iodobutane, we used additional physic-
ochemical methods (XPS, XFSA, and elemental analysis).
The results of such analysis for AP-MgO samples treated
with 1-iodobutane at 100 and 300 ◦C are reported in Ta-
ble 2.
XPS spectra in the I 3d5/2 region are presented in Fig. 8.
The spectra clearly show that no signiﬁcant changes occur
in the state of iodine when the reaction temperature is in-
creased from 100 to 400 ◦C. Most of the iodine corresponds
to the ionic state I−in magnesium iodide [20,21]. Weak
additional lines appear at higher bonding energies of 624–
627 eV. They most likely correspond to iodine chemically
bound with carbonaceous residues. The amount of iodine in
these states does not exceed 1% of the total amount of iodine
in the samples.
The total number of iodine atoms relative to the num-
ber of magnesium atoms is low, only about 2.9% (see Ta-
ble 2). Therefore, no shoulders corresponding to Mg2+ ions
in MgI2 are observed in the Mg 2s spectra. As the MgI2
phase is not detected by XRD, it is natural to assume that
I−observed in the samples corresponds to a surface io-
dide.
It is important to understand that the iodine concentra-
tion in the surface monolayer must be much higher than 3%.

MgO is 4.21 Å, so that the minimum distance between Mg
atoms is 2.105 Å. This means that the depth of the surface
layer studied by XPS is about 15 monolayers. Thus, assum-
ing that all iodine is located in one surface monolayer, the
iodine concentration in this monolayer can be estimated to
be 45 at%. In other words, a signiﬁcant part of the MgO sur-
face is covered with iodine after reaction.
The elemental analysis showed that the MgO samples
after reaction with 1-iodobutane contain carbon and iodine
(Table 2). The combined contents of I and C agree well with
the weight gain observed in the gravimetric experiments.
Note that the concentration of carbon on the MgO surface
is 2.5 times higher after reaction at 100 ◦C in comparison
with the reaction at 300 ◦C. Meanwhile, the iodine contents
in the two cases are similar (about 9 wt%). The iodine con-
tents calculated from the XFSA results agree very well with
the elemental analysis data (Table 2).
5. Conclusion
Thus, there is no bulk MgI2 formation during the reaction
of 1-iodobutane with AP-MgO. However, the modiﬁcation
of surface by I−leads to a change in reaction selectivity.
The iodinated surface begins to act as a Lewis acid by a stage
E1 mechanism of iodine elimination from 1-iodobutane. The
iodination also resulted in 2-iodobutane formation by re-
versible reaction of HI with butene over iodinated surface
of magnesium oxide.
