Active Catalysts in Oxidative Coupling of Methane Kiyoshi Otsuka" and Takayuki Komatsu Department of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technolog y, Ooka yama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152, Japan The NaCVMn-oxide catalyst shows higher catalytic activity than any previously reported in converting methane into ethylene and higher alkenes with yields of 15.7-30.6% at 750C.
Oxidative dehydrogenation and coupling of CH4 producing C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 + C2H4) has attracted much attention since the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin.1 Many groups2--7 are working in this area and there is increasing industrial activity.8 However, the reactivities of the catalysts reported recently for synthesizing C2 hydrocarbons are still not satisfactory.
We have already reported that the oxides of the first-row transition elements, such as the oxides of Ni, Ti, and Zn,containing lithium chloride had high catalytic activities in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4.4c The highest space time yields (S.T.Y.) observed for the synthesis of C2 hydrocar- bons were 27 and 11 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 for the LiC1-added manganese oxide (denoted as LiCl/Mn-oxide) and LiCl/Ni- oxide, respectively.
Tentative experiments showed that the addition of NaCl instead of LiCl to manganese oxides gave better C2-S.T.Y.
(S.T.Y. for the synthesis of C2 hydrocarbons) compared to that for LiCl/Mn-oxide. However, NaCl/Ni-oxide did not show better catalytic activity in the synthesis of C2 compounds than that observed for LiCl/Ni-oxide. We now report results for NaClMn-oxides which show better catalytic activities than literature values. 1 - 7
Powdered NaCl/Mn-oxides catalysts, containing 20 mol% sodium metal, were prepared f r o m NaCl and Mn02 as the initial manganese oxide. The catalysts were pretreated in air at 750 "C for 2 h before use. The catalysts were studied using a fixed-bed reactor with a conventional gas-flow system at atmospheric pressure using helium as carrier gas. The products after 25 min on stream were measured by gas chromatography. The conversion of CH4, the selectivities ,and the yields of the products were calculated on the basis of carbon number of CH4 reacted.
Table 1 shows the conversions of CH4 and 02,the selectivity for hydrocarbon formation (>C2), and the yields of hydro- carbons observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide and LiCl/Ni-oxide catalysts. The former catalyst was mechanically mixed with quartz sand (5 g) as a diluent before being packed in the reactor because the dispersion of the catalyst increased the total yields of hydrocarbons. The experimental conditions are given in Table 1.Oxygen-containing organic compounds such as MeOH and HCHO were not produced. As can be seen in Table 1, the main products are C2H4 under any conditions tested. It is to be noted that C3H6, C4Hs,benzene, and toluene are also produced. The selectivity for the formation of total hydrocarbons (2C2) observed for NaCl/Mn-oxide at a pres- sure of reactant 0.09 atm reached 30.6%. S.T.Y.s of C2 compounds (C2H4 + C2H6) and of total hydrocarbons (2C2> increased linearly with increasing pressure of reactants. The highest S.T.Y.s of total hydrocarbons observed are 72.3 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (48.2 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide and
18.5 mmol (g-cat)-l h-1 (43.0 mmol rn-2 h-1) for LiCl/Ni-
oxide. The highest C2-S.T.Y. in Table 1 is 64.0 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 (42.7 mmol m-2 h-1) for NaCl/Mn-oxide. These values are higher than any previously reported.1-7 For example, the highest C2-S.T.Y. previously observed for LiCl/Mn-oxide was 27 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-1 under the conditions T = 75OoC,
P(CH4) + P(0,) =
0.84 atm, P(CH4)
:
P(0,) = 2: 1,
total gas flow rate = 100 ml min-1, weight of catalyst = 1.00 g.4 The C2-S.T.Y. observed for NaCVMn-oxide in Table 1 under similar conditions is 50.4 mmol (g-cat)-1 h-l,l.9 times greater than the value for the LiCl/Mn-oxide. Since the oxygen in the reactants was almost completely consumed ( O2 conversion >93'/0) during passage through the catalyst bed, we can expect higher S.T.Y.s than those in Table 1 when the flow rate of the reactants and the partial pressure of oxygen are increased further than the conditions described in Table 1.The NaCl/Mn-oxide is superior to the LiCl/Mn-oxide for the Table 1.

following reasons. (i) As described above, the catalytic activity of the NaCl/Mn-oxide is greater than that of the LiCl/Mn-oxide. (ii) Deactivation of the latter catalyst com- menced after 2 h stream, but no deactivation of the former catalyst was observed after 8 h.
In conclusion, the high catalytic activity and good stability of the catalyst observed for NaCI/Mn-oxide suggest that this is a promising catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane.
