[1] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
[2] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."
[3] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify the surface chemistry by turning the surface into a Lewis acid or base, which influences the dissociation of halogens. La-doped CeO2 becomes a Lewis acid, causing halogen atoms to bind strongly to the oxygen site as a base. Ta-doped ceria, on the other hand, becomes a Lewis base, leading halogens to bind more strongly to the cerium site as an acid. These changes in surface chemistry can enhance catalytic activity by facilitating the breaking of chemical bonds in reactants.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过将表面转化为Lewis酸或碱来改变表面化学，从而影响卤素的解离。La掺杂的CeO2变成Lewis酸，导致卤素原子强烈地作为碱结合到氧位点。而Ta掺杂的铈则变成Lewis碱，导致卤素作为酸更强烈地结合到铈位点。这些表面化学的变化可以通过促进反应物中化学键的断裂来增强催化活性。
