[1] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
[2] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."
[3] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify the surface chemistry by turning the surface into a Lewis acid or a base, which strongly influences the dissociation of halogens. For instance, La-doped CeO2 becomes a Lewis acid, driving halogen atoms to bind to the oxygen site where they act as bases, resulting in a stronger bond than on undoped surfaces. Conversely, Ta-doped ceria surfaces become Lewis bases, causing halogens to bind to the Ce site where they act as acids, also leading to a stronger bond than on pure ceria.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过将表面转化为Lewis酸或碱来改变表面化学，从而强烈影响卤素的解离。例如，La掺杂的CeO2变成Lewis酸，促使卤素原子结合到氧位点，它们在那里充当碱，导致比未掺杂表面更强的键。相反，Ta掺杂的铈表面变成Lewis碱，导致卤素结合到Ce位点，它们在那里充当酸，也导致比纯铈更强的键。
