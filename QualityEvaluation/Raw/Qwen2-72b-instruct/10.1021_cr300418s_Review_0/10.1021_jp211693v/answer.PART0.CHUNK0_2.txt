[1] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."
[2] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."
[3] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify the surface chemistry by turning the surface into a Lewis acid or base, which strongly influences the dissociation of halogens. For instance, La-doped CeO2 becomes a Lewis acid, causing halogen atoms to bind more strongly to the oxygen site as a base. Conversely, Ta-doped ceria becomes a Lewis base, leading halogen atoms to bind more strongly to the cerium site as an acid. These modifications can enhance catalytic activity by facilitating the breaking of chemical bonds in reactants.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过将表面转变为Lewis酸或碱来改变表面化学，从而强烈影响卤素的解离。例如，La掺杂的CeO2变成Lewis酸，导致卤素原子作为碱更强烈地结合到氧位点。相反，Ta掺杂的铈变成Lewis碱，导致卤素原子作为酸更强烈地结合到铈位点。这些修改可以通过促进反应物中化学键的断裂来增强催化活性。
