Catalysis Letters 2 (1989) 309-318 309 THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF METHANE ON OXIDE/SiO2 CATALYSTS BY TETRACHLOROMETHANE
S. AHMED and J.B. MOFFAT
* Department of Chemistry; University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3GI Received 31 January 1989; accepted 5 April 1989 The introduction of carbon tetrachloride to the feed stream in the conversion of methane to C a hydrocarbons over a variety of silica-supported oxides is shown to alter both the conversion and selectivity, but, notably with oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn produces remarkable increases in the yield and selectivity to C2H 4 and C2H6, particularly the former.
1. Introduction
The oxidative coupling of methane, the major component of natural gas, to ethane and ethylene is currently a subject of intensive research interest [1]. Since the pioneering work of Keller and Bhasin [2] a wide variety of catalytic sub- stances, supported or bulk, doped or undoped, has been studied as heterogeneous catalysts in the coupling reaction. At the present time, the more effective catalysts include alkaline earth oxides promoted with alkali elements [3-7], some rare earth oxides especially Li-doped Sm 203 [8], transition metal oxides such as those of Mn and Ni after addition of LiC1 [9], alkali metal promoted manganese oxide supported on silica [10] and layered bismuth oxyhalides [11].
Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes. Sofranko et at. [14,15] have reported that higher selectivities to C2
hydrocarbons can be obtained in methane conversion on sodium/manganese/ silica catalyst in the presence of gaseous CH3C1 or HC1. However this work was primarily concerned with the aforementioned catalyst operating in redox cycle.
In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different * To whom correspondence should be addressed. 9 J.C.

products. The presence of the additive significantly enhanced the activity of 12-molybdophosphoric acid and of 12-tungstophosphoric acid supported on silica. While over 12-molybdophosphoric acid a large increase in the yield of oxygenated hydrocarbon (HCHO) was noted, over 12-tungstophosphoric acid monochloromethane was produced with a high selectivity and a reasonable yield with little or no effect on the yield of HCHO.
In the light of these positive effects of a chloroadditive on the partial oxidation of methane as observed with heteropoly oxometalates in this laboratory we have undertaken an extensive study of the effect of these chlorocompounds on the direct oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons using a variety of catalytic materials. In the present communication the result of the addition of a small quantity of tetrachloromethane to the feed on the oxidative dimerization reaction with a number of silica supported metal oxides is reported.
2. Experimental
The catalysts used were prepared by impregnating the support (Grace-Davison,grade 407, 740 m2/g) with aqueous solutions of metal acetates or nitrates at 80-90  C, followed by a drying in air at 110  C for 3 h and finally calcining in air at 750 for 4 h. The metal salts were impregnated to give nominally 5 wt% metal loadings. For Mn, Co, Bi and Pb, the corresponding nitrates were used for impregnation. For the remaining catalysts, acetates were used. The tests of catalysts was carried out using a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor operated in a flow mode at atmospheric pressure. The reactor consisted of a 8 mm-id and 35 mm length quartz tube sealed to 4 mm-id quartz tubes on two sides (total length of the reactor was 200 mm). The catalyst was placed in the 8 mm-id portion of the reactor whose length was just enough to accommodate the catalyst particles.
The reactor was designed in this manner to keep the dead space of the reactor at a minimum in the hottest zone with the aim of minimizing the contribution of non-catalytic homogeneous reactions as far as possible. The additive, CC14, was admitted to the main flow of reactants (CH4, 02, and He) by passing a separate stream of helium through a gas dispersion tube in a glass saturator containing the liquid at ice-water temperature. The flow of helium was so adjusted that after dilution following introduction to the main flow of feed the appropriate con- centration of the additive in the flow was achieved. The reaction conditions used were as follows: W= 1.5 g, F = 30 ml/min; T= 775 P(CH4)= 220 torr, P(O2) = 210 and 35 torr, P(CC14)= 0 or 1.1 _+ 0.1 torr, balance to the atmo- spheric pressure was provided by helium.
The reactants and products were analyzed on a gas chromatograph (TCD) with MS 5A and Porapak T column packings. The main products of reaction were CO, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, CH3C1 and H20. C 3 hydrocarbons, H2CO and CH3OH were,at most, produced in trace quantities and have been neglected. The conversion of
S. Ahmed, J.B. Moffat / Enhancement of oxidative coupling of methane
311 methane was calculated on a carbon-account-for basis. The selectivities were calculated on the basis of the conversion of methane (expressed as mole per- centage) to each product. For example, the selectivity to ethylene was calculated as 100 • [2 • moles of ethylene produced]/(moles of methane converted).

It should be noted that the presence of the corresponding carbonate cannot be ruled out when acetates are used for impreg- nation. In addition to the catalysts tabulated here, Cd/SiO> Zn/SiO 2, Ni/SiO 2 were also tested. With these catalysts, however, there was no significant effect of the CC14 additive on the reaction features and selectivities to C 2 products were quite low, although, of these catalysts, Ni/SiO 2 showed the highest activity.
It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCI 4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO 2, Cs/SiO 2 and Mn/SiO 2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts. In addition, with Ba/SiO 2 and Cs/SiO 2 a remarkable increase in the selectivity to C2 products was observed. However, with Mn/SiO 2,the increase in the selectivity to products was not so profound. The conversion of CH 4 and the corresponding yield of C 2 products observed in the absence of the catalyst or over the silica support under otherwise identical conditions, as shown in tables 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that the contributions of the non-catalytic reaction or of the support to conversions and yields observed in the presence of these three catalysts are quite small. However in the absence of the catalyst when the conversion of methane was very low, the selectivity to C 2 products was quite high, particularly in the presence of CC14 in the feed (table 1).
S. Ahmed, J.B. Moffat / Enhancement of oxidative coupling of methane
313 It is interesting to note that with each of the aforementioned three catalysts (Mn/SiO 2, Cs/SiO2, Ba/SiO2), in the presence of CC14 in the feed, ethylene is produced in larger quantities than that of ethane. Increase in the oxygen pressure,as evident from a comparison of tables 1 and 2, results in an increase in the conversion but produces a decrease in the selectivity to hydrocarbons while the ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 in the product stream increases.
It should be pointed out that, unlike with Ba/SiO 2 and Cs/SiO2, with other oxides of these groups (Ca/SiO 2, K/SiO2) the introduction of CC14 is less effective in enhancing the formation of C 2 products. In fact, on Ca/SiO 2 at higher oxygen pressure no increase in the yield of C 2 products in the presence of CO14 was observed.
Table 1 shows that introduction of CCI 4 in the feed resulted in large increases in the conversion also over Co/SiO 2 and Bi/SiO2, but did not promote coupling of methane. It is interesting to note that over Co/SiOa, the product of the reaction is almost entirely CO. However since the quantity of water produced was much too small to account for the stoichiometry CH 4 + 3/202 - CO + 2H20 it is suspected that substantial amounts of H 2 were produced over Co/SiO 2.
It may be noted that in the absence of CC14, Pb/SiO 2 and T1/SiO 2 showed very high selectivity to C 2 products. Both selectivity and yield of C 2 products observed over T1/SiOa were, in fact, even higher than those observed on CC14 modified Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO 2 or Mn/SiO 2. Interestingly, however, on both these oxides the oxidation of methane was strongly inhibited by the presence Of CC] 4 in the feed. On Pb/SiO2, the effect was temporal in the sense that upon elimination of CC14 from the feed the activity of the catalyst was gradually reestablished and the conversion and selectivities approached those observed before the sample was exposed to CC14 (data in parentheses in tables 1 and 2 refer to values observed after several hours of reaction following elimination of CC14 from the feed stream). On the other hand, over Tt/SiO2, the inhibition of oxidation induced by the exposure of the catalyst to eel 4 appeared to be permanent since the activity of the catalyst was not permanent since the activity of the catalyst was not regained after elimination of CC14 from the feed.
In fig. 1 yields of C 2 hydrocarbons and selectivities to individual C 2 products are compared in the presence and absence of CC14 for the three catalysts showing the more favourable results. The dramatic influence of the presence of a small quantity of CC14 in the feed in enhancing the yields of hydrocarbon as discussed above is very clearly demonstrated in this figure. It may be mentioned that the ratios of C 2 hydrocarbons produced to CC14 added in the feed for the conditions of the experiments described in fig. 1 are 18, 23 and 6 for Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO 2 and Mn/SiO 2 respectively. From fig. 1 it is evident that for Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2, the presence of CC14 increases the selectivity to both ethane and ethylene, but more so for ethylene. However, for Mn/SiO2, the presence of CCI 4 increases the selectivity to ethylene but, somewhat suppresses that to ethane. These trends are also reflected in the data of tables 1 and 2 obtained for two reactant composi- tions. 314

Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time. On Ba/SiO 2 a large 316

4. Discussion
In this communication a potentially new route to promote the oxidative coupling of methane on heterogeneous catalysts is described. The process involves the introduction of a small quantity of a chloromethane to the feed stream. The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C 2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane. It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used. For example, in addition to oxides which facilitate the coupling reaction, there are some oxides such as Ni/SiO2, Cd/SiO2, and Zn/SiO 2 which appear to have little effect on the oxidation process and some such as Pb/SiO 2, and T1/SiO 2 with which the addition of CCl 4 strongly inhibits the reaction. None the less, there are also some oxides which strongly accelerate the oxidation process but do not promote the coupling reaction in the presence of CC!4. In view of such diverse behaviour where CC14 has been added, it is reasonable to suspect that CC14 is modifying the oxide surface in a number of ways. The observed effects may, among others,depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form C1 atoms or radicals.
At the present stage, very little can be said about the mechanism of the reaction. The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCI 4 [5,10,19], that C2H 6 is the primary C 2 product and C2H 4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6. The relatively high ratio of C2H 4 to C2H 6 observed in the presence of CC14 in the feed suggests that halogen radicals supplied from CC14 are catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C2H 6 to C2H 4. It may be noted that in the absence of any catalyst the ratio of C2H4/C2H6 was also much higher when the experiment was conducted with CC14 in the feed.
It is difficult therefore to separate the heterogeneous from the homogeneous involvement in the enrichment of C2H 4 to C2H 6 ratio in the presence of CC14. In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze forma- tions of C2H 4 from CH 4 in the gas phase [20,21]. It may be noted that with CC14 in the feed, in addition to CO, CO 2, C2H 4 and C2H6, CH3C1 is formed although in very small quantities. This suggests that products apart from being formed directly from CH4, may have resulted from the formation of CH3C1 and its
S. Ahmed, J.B. Moffat / Enhancement of oxidative coupling of methane
317 subsequent oxidation. The low selectivity of CH3C1 is not surprising in view of the high temperature used.
While it is realized that the yields and selectivities obtained for C 2 products are not as high as those reported in the literature obtained with some alkali promoted alkaline earth and rare earth oxides, nevertheless, in view of the remarkable increase observed both in the yield and selectivity of dimerized product, it is believed that further studies will provide valuable practical and mechanistic information on the conversion process and the nature of the additive effect.
Detailed studies are currently in progress.
