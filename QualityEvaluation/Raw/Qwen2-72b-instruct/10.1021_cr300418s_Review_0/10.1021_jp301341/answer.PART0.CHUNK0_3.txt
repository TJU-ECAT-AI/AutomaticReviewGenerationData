[1] "There is much work, both experimental (71) and computational, (6, 8-10, 38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 72-85) that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."
[2] "In this section, we point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (46, 77, 86, 87) (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."
[3] "When making such a substitution, we create an electron deficit in the oxide. In the first example, the La atom being replaced provided (formally) three electrons to the oxide, and its replacement (Mg or Zn) provides only two. The substitution creates a need for an extra electron, and this turns the doped surface into a Lewis acid."
[4] "The notion that the oxide doped with a LVD is a Lewis acid is supported by the analysis of the density of states. It has been found (46, 77, 86, 87) that doping creates a hole in the oxide. The LUMO is shifted, by doping, from the bottom of the valence band to a state of lower energy. Therefore, doping increases the ability of the oxide to accept electrons, making the system a stronger acid."
[5] "According to our rules, a base binds substantially more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the surface of the undoped one."
[6] "The rule that a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of an oxide doped with a LVD works whether the oxide is reducible or not."
[7] "However, the details of the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can be different on reducible oxides than on the irreducible ones."
[8] "The reducible oxides are more complicated because their cations are Lewis acids (see Section 9): in the presence of a base they can be reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+ or from Ti4+ to Ti3+."
[9] "Therefore, a reducible oxide doped with a LVD has two acidic sites: the hole created by the presence of the LVD and the reducible cation (e.g., Ce4+ or Ti4+)."
[10] "When we adsorb a base on such a surface, the two acids compete for the electron donated by the base."
[11] "It is not clear a priori whether the electron donated by the base fills the hole or reduces the cation."
[12] "In an irreducible oxide doped with a LVD, the base always fills the hole since the cations cannot be reduced."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by turning the oxide surface into a Lewis acid when a lower-valence cation replaces the host oxide's cation. This substitution creates an electron deficit, making the doped surface a Lewis acid. Doping increases the oxide's ability to accept electrons, making the system a stronger acid. As a result, a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the undoped one. This effect is observed in both reducible and irreducible oxides. In reducible oxides, the cations can be reduced in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides, the base always fills the hole created by the LVD. The competition between the hole and the reducible cation for the electron donated by the base is unclear. These modifications can enhance catalytic activity, change the nature and location of active centers, and potentially improve industrially relevant reactions.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过替代性阳离子掺杂可以改变表面化学并破坏化学键，当较低价的阳离子取代宿主氧化物的阳离子时，氧化物表面会变成路易斯酸。这种替代会产生电子缺陷，使掺杂表面成为路易斯酸。掺杂增强了氧化物接受电子的能力，使系统成为更强的酸。因此，路易斯碱在掺杂氧化物表面的结合比在未掺杂的表面上更强。这种效应在可还原和不可还原的氧化物中都能观察到。在可还原的氧化物中，阳离子在碱性存在下可以被还原，而在不可还原的氧化物中，碱总是填充由LVD产生的空穴。关于空穴和可还原阳离子对碱性捐赠的电子的竞争尚不清楚。这些修改可以增强催化活性，改变活性中心的性质和位置，并可能改善工业相关的反应。
