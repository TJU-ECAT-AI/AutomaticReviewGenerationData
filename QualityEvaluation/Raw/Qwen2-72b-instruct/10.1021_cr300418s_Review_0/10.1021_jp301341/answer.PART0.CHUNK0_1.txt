[1] "We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[3] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."
[4] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[7] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active. However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the Lewis acid-base properties of the surface. This can lead to the creation of new active sites and enhance catalytic activity. Doping with low-valence dopants turns the surface into a Lewis acid, which can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of bases like H, CH3, and CO, and make the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic. Reducible oxides are inherently Lewis acids, and their acidity can be further enhanced by doping, which can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increase the binding energy of single metal atoms. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, adsorbing strongly Lewis acids like O2 or X2. In some cases, the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it can act as a low-valence dopant, activating surface oxygen. These changes in surface chemistry can disrupt chemical bonding and lead to the formation of new active centers, potentially improving the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中，替代性阳离子掺杂通过改变表面的Lewis酸碱性质来改变表面化学并破坏化学键。这可能导致新活性位点的形成和催化活性的增强。用低价掺杂剂掺杂会使表面变成Lewis酸，这可以降低氧空位形成能，增加H、CH3和CO等碱的结合能，并使烷烃的解离吸附更加放热。可还原氧化物本质上是Lewis酸，通过掺杂可以进一步增强其酸性，这可以降低氧空位形成能，增加单金属原子的结合能。高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱，强烈吸附像O2或X2这样的Lewis酸。在某些情况下，掺杂剂与吸附在其上的O2形成的基团可以作为低价掺杂剂，激活表面氧。这些表面化学的变化可以破坏化学键，导致新活性中心的形成，可能提高工业相关反应的效率。
