[1] "There is much work, both experimental (71) and computational, (6, 8-10, 38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 72-85) that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."
[2] "In this section, we point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (46, 77, 86, 87) (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."
[3] "When making such a substitution, we create an electron deficit in the oxide. In the first example, the La atom being replaced provided (formally) three electrons to the oxide, and its replacement (Mg or Zn) provides only two. The substitution creates a need for an extra electron, and this turns the doped surface into a Lewis acid."
[4] "The notion that the oxide doped with a LVD is a Lewis acid is supported by the analysis of the density of states. It has been found (46, 77, 86, 87) that doping creates a hole in the oxide. The LUMO is shifted, by doping, from the bottom of the valence band to a state of lower energy. Therefore, doping increases the ability of the oxide to accept electrons, making the system a stronger acid."
[5] "According to our rules, a base binds substantially more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the surface of the undoped one."
[6] "The rule that a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of an oxide doped with a LVD works whether the oxide is reducible or not."
[7] "However, the details of the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can be different on reducible oxides than on the irreducible ones."
[8] "The reducible oxides are more complicated because their cations are Lewis acids (see Section 9): in the presence of a base they can be reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+ or from Ti4+ to Ti3+."
[9] "Therefore, a reducible oxide doped with a LVD has two acidic sites: the hole created by the presence of the LVD and the reducible cation (e.g., Ce4+ or Ti4+)."
[10] "When we adsorb a base on such a surface, the two acids compete for the electron donated by the base."
[11] "It is not clear a priori whether the electron donated by the base fills the hole or reduces the cation."
[12] "In an irreducible oxide doped with a LVD, the base always fills the hole since the cations cannot be reduced."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by turning the oxide surface into a Lewis acid when a lower-valence cation replaces the host oxide's cation. This substitution creates an electron deficit, making the doped surface a Lewis acid. The oxide doped with a low-valence dopant (LVD) becomes a stronger acid, as evidenced by the analysis of the density of states, where doping creates a hole in the oxide and shifts the LUMO to a state of lower energy. As a result, a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the undoped one, regardless of whether the oxide is reducible or not. However, the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can differ between reducible and irreducible oxides. Reducible oxides have cations that can act as Lewis acids and be reduced in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides doped with an LVD, the base always fills the hole created by the dopant.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过替代性阳离子掺杂可以改变表面化学并破坏化学键，当较低价的阳离子取代宿主氧化物的阳离子时，氧化物表面会变成路易斯酸。这种替代会产生电子缺陷，使掺杂表面成为路易斯酸。用低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂的氧化物变得更酸，这从态密度分析中得到证实，掺杂在氧化物中产生一个空穴，并将LUMO转移到较低能量的状态。因此，路易斯碱在掺杂氧化物表面的结合比在未掺杂的氧化物表面更强，无论氧化物是否可还原。然而，酸和碱之间电荷交换的机制在可还原和不可还原的氧化物之间可能不同。可还原氧化物具有可以作为路易斯酸并在存在碱的情况下被还原的阳离子，而在用LVD掺杂的不可还原氧化物中，碱总是填充掺杂剂产生的空穴。
