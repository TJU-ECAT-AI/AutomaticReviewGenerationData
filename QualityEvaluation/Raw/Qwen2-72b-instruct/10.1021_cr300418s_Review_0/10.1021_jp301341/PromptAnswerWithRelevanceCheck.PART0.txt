[1] "There is much work, both experimental (71) and computational, (6, 8-10, 38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 72-85) that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."
[2] "In this section, we point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (46, 77, 86, 87) (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."
[3] "When making such a substitution, we create an electron deficit in the oxide. In the first example, the La atom being replaced provided (formally) three electrons to the oxide, and its replacement (Mg or Zn) provides only two. The substitution creates a need for an extra electron, and this turns the doped surface into a Lewis acid."
[4] "The notion that the oxide doped with a LVD is a Lewis acid is supported by the analysis of the density of states. It has been found (46, 77, 86, 87) that doping creates a hole in the oxide. The LUMO is shifted, by doping, from the bottom of the valence band to a state of lower energy. Therefore, doping increases the ability of the oxide to accept electrons, making the system a stronger acid."
[5] "According to our rules, a base binds substantially more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the surface of the undoped one."
[6] "The rule that a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of an oxide doped with a LVD works whether the oxide is reducible or not."
[7] "However, the details of the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can be different on reducible oxides than on the irreducible ones."
[8] "The reducible oxides are more complicated because their cations are Lewis acids (see Section 9): in the presence of a base they can be reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+ or from Ti4+ to Ti3+."
[9] "Therefore, a reducible oxide doped with a LVD has two acidic sites: the hole created by the presence of the LVD and the reducible cation (e.g., Ce4+ or Ti4+)."
[10] "When we adsorb a base on such a surface, the two acids compete for the electron donated by the base."
[11] "It is not clear a priori whether the electron donated by the base fills the hole or reduces the cation."
[12] "In an irreducible oxide doped with a LVD, the base always fills the hole since the cations cannot be reduced."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by turning the oxide surface into a Lewis acid when a lower-valence cation replaces the host oxide's cation. This substitution creates an electron deficit, making the doped surface a Lewis acid. The oxide doped with a low-valence dopant (LVD) becomes a stronger acid, as evidenced by the analysis of the density of states, where doping creates a hole in the oxide and shifts the LUMO to a state of lower energy. As a result, a Lewis base binds more strongly to the surface of the doped oxide than to the undoped one, regardless of whether the oxide is reducible or not. However, the mechanism of charge exchange between the acid and the base can differ between reducible and irreducible oxides. Reducible oxides have cations that can act as Lewis acids and be reduced in the presence of a base, while in irreducible oxides doped with an LVD, the base always fills the hole created by the dopant.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中，通过替代性阳离子掺杂可以改变表面化学并破坏化学键，当较低价的阳离子取代宿主氧化物的阳离子时，氧化物表面会变成路易斯酸。这种替代会产生电子缺陷，使掺杂表面成为路易斯酸。用低价掺杂剂(LVD)掺杂的氧化物变得更酸，这从态密度分析中得到证实，掺杂在氧化物中产生一个空穴，并将LUMO转移到较低能量的状态。因此，路易斯碱在掺杂氧化物表面的结合比在未掺杂的氧化物表面更强，无论氧化物是否可还原。然而，酸和碱之间电荷交换的机制在可还原和不可还原的氧化物之间可能不同。可还原氧化物具有可以作为路易斯酸并在存在碱的情况下被还原的阳离子，而在用LVD掺杂的不可还原氧化物中，碱总是填充掺杂剂产生的空穴。

[1] "We have shown that many trends related to chemical processes relevant to catalytic chemistry of oxide surfaces can be predicted (or rationalized) by a few rules pertaining to the Lewis acidbase properties of the chemicals involved."
[2] "These rules seem general (we found no exceptions); the effects predicted by them are large; and they seem to apply any time a chemical process involves a Lewis acid and a base, regardless of the chemical nature of the pair."
[3] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."
[4] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."
[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."
[7] "If the dopant is very basic, the O2 molecule (or X2) adsorbed on it is bound too strongly, and it is not chemically active. However, in some cases the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it acts as a low-valence dopant and activates surface oxygen."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding by changing the Lewis acid-base properties of the surface. This can lead to the creation of new active sites and enhance catalytic activity. Doping with low-valence dopants turns the surface into a Lewis acid, which can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of bases like H, CH3, and CO, and make the dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic. Reducible oxides are inherently Lewis acids, and their acidity can be further enhanced by doping, which can lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increase the binding energy of single metal atoms. High-valence dopants act as Lewis bases, adsorbing strongly Lewis acids like O2 or X2. In some cases, the group formed by the dopant with O2 adsorbed on it can act as a low-valence dopant, activating surface oxygen. These changes in surface chemistry can disrupt chemical bonding and lead to the formation of new active centers, potentially improving the efficiency of industrially relevant reactions.

1.在金属氧化物催化剂中，替代性阳离子掺杂通过改变表面的Lewis酸碱性质来改变表面化学并破坏化学键。这可能导致新活性位点的形成和催化活性的增强。用低价掺杂剂掺杂会使表面变成Lewis酸，这可以降低氧空位形成能，增加H、CH3和CO等碱的结合能，并使烷烃的解离吸附更加放热。可还原氧化物本质上是Lewis酸，通过掺杂可以进一步增强其酸性，这可以降低氧空位形成能，增加单金属原子的结合能。高价掺杂剂作为Lewis碱，强烈吸附像O2或X2这样的Lewis酸。在某些情况下，掺杂剂与吸附在其上的O2形成的基团可以作为低价掺杂剂，激活表面氧。这些表面化学的变化可以破坏化学键，导致新活性中心的形成，可能提高工业相关反应的效率。
