Bromine-mediated conversion of methane to C1 oxygenates over Zn-MCM-41 supported mercuric oxide Fengbo Li, Guoqing Yuan *, Fang Yan, Fengwen Yan Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), Laboratory of New Materials, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China Received 21 June 2007; received in revised form 5 November 2007; accepted 12 November 2007 Available online 19 November 2007 Abstract The structure mobility of the zigzag mercuric oxide chains and the strong preference of mercuric (II) cation sites for bromine lead to a novel bromine-mediated partial methane oxidation at relatively low reaction temperature (220 8C). Zn-MCM-41 supported mercuric oxide nanophases were used as the model catalyst to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle. The introduction of bromine to feed gas consisting of CH4/ O2/Ar (3:1:6) leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion. Meanwhile, a transient high product selectivity to C1 oxygenates was observed.
Two bromine-mediated routes can be identified: MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation, which occur simultaneously in the methane conversion. The controlling mechanism transfers from the former to the latter with the gradual fixation of bromine into mercuric oxide lattice. The catalyst was characterized detailedly by XRD, XPS, and N2 sorption. The chemical composite changes of active species were detected by XPS, which provide some direct information about the mediator role of bromine in the catalytic cycle.

1. Introduction
The catalytic partial oxidation of methane (POM) to C1 oxygenates remains a challenging task with high pay-off,because of the low reactivity of the substrate and the poor selectivity to the desired products (CH3OH and/or H2CO)[17].
Many low temperature homogeneous processes in strong acidic media have been reported to convert methane to various methyl derivatives such as methanol [8,9], methane sulfonic acid [10,11], methane sulfonyl chlorides [12], methyl bisulfate [13,14], and acetic acid [1518]. But the POM over solid catalysts requires high reaction temperature and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates is poor. The target products (CH3OH and/or H2CO) are less thermodynamically stable than methane and hence are further oxidized to carbon oxides. A great deal of research has focused on many factors controlling the process activity and selectivity. Adding NOx into reactant stream of CH4/ O2 has been proved to be an efficient approach to increase the activity and selectivity of POM over silica supported vanadium oxides [1921]. Dispersion and localization state of the active phasesisanotheraffecting factor determiningthe performance of POM catalysts. The isolated active sites can prevent the over- oxidation of C1 oxygenates to carbon oxides, but the agglomerated active sites may lead to the sequent oxidation of C1 oxygenates by the vicinal sites of the reaction site [2228].
Halogen-mediated conversion ofmethanehasbeen consideredto be a low temperature process with relatively high selectivity to C1 oxygenates. Olah et al. have described a sequential two-step process including the selective monohalogenation of methane over supported acid and platinum-metal catalysts and the following hydrolysis of methyl halides over g-alumina- supported metal oxide/hydroxide catalysts converts methane to methanol and dimethyl ether [29]. Lorkovic et al. proposed a process for the functionalization of methane and ethane using bromine as the mediator over a sequential zone flow reactor (SZFR) [30]. Recently we have reported a bromine-mediated process by using supported hydrate dibromodioxomolybdenum as catalysts [31].

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2007.11.014 selective halogenation of methane followed by the catalytic dehalogenation of methyl halide to oxygenate. Herein, we investigate bromine-mediated selective methane oxidation process over supported mercuric oxide nanophases. Bromine is involved in the catalytic cycle both by forming methyl bromide and by activating the lattice oxygen of active sites and facilitating the regeneration of active sites.
Soft mercuric cation sites show a strong preference for halogens [32]. Methyl bromide can be facilely converted to MeHgBrn, which is further oxidized to C1 oxygenates.
Elemental bromine can be inserted into zigzag OHgO HgO chains at room temperature and the lattice oxygens are activated to give highly active catalytic oxidation agents:mercuric hypobromite, which are active for methane oxidation under mild conditions [33] (Scheme 1). The resulting mercuric bromide lattice can be facilely reoxidized to HgO chains by dioxygen under 200 8C. The released bromine is recycled to activate the lattice oxygens in HgO chains and form methyl bromide.
Through this mechanism,a bromine-mediated methane oxidative conversion catalytic cycle can be proposed (Scheme 2). Because of the special reactions between mercuric
(II)
oxide and bromine, the supported mercuric oxide nanophases are the excellent model catalyst to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of the catalyst
Zn-MCM-41 was prepared as the following method. 1.2 g Zn(OH)2 was dissolved in 9.5 g 25 wt.% ammonia and then the mixture was added into 120 ml aqueous solution of 2.4 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide.
Ten grams tetraethyl orthosilicate was added drop by drop in 15 min. After a few minutes, the formed white solids were filtered and dried in air at 90 8C. Calcining at 90 8C for 6 h gives Zn-MCM-41. The aqueous solution of Hg(NO3)2 and NH4NO3 was introduced into the mesopores of Zn-MCM-41 by wet impregnation. The incipient sample was dried at 70 8C in air and treated at 300 8C under argon stream to give Zn-MCM-41 supported HgO.
2.2. Catalytic activity test
Catalytic activity measurement (1.6 g catalysts, load of HgO is 8.0 wt.%) was conducted in a conventional fixed bed reactor at 220 8C with the feed gas consisting of methane, oxygen, and argon (PAr : PCH4 : PO2  6 : 3 : 1, W/F = 0.3 g min cm3). At
1.5 h on the reaction stream, bromine (2.0 mmol Br2) is injected
into a gasification chamber and conveyed into the catalyst column by feed gas. The product analysis was performed on a DB5 column (30 m  0.25 mm) using a VG Trio200 with TCD or MS detector. Conversion and selectivity are defined as % conversion = [([CH4]inlet  [CH4]outlet)/[CH4]inlet]  100 and % selectivity to X = [[X]/([CH4]inlet  [CH4]outlet)]  100.
2.3. Characterizations of the catalyst
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 WAl-Ka radiation. The base pressure was about 3  109 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the reaction mechanism between bromine and mercuric (II) oxide.

83 the C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. Eclipse
V2.1 data analysis software supplied by the VG ESCALab200i-
XL instrument manufacturer was applied in manipulation of the acquired spectra. Powder XRD patterns were measured on a Rigadu Rotaflex diffractometer equipped with a rotation anode and Cu-Ka radiation (40 kV, 200 mA; l = 1.54056 A ). Nitro- gen adsorption isothermal and textural properties of the as- synthesized materials were determined at 77.3 K using nitrogen by a Quantachrome Autosorb Automated Gas Sorption System (Quantachrome Corporation). Before analysis, HgO/Zn-MCM- 41 was dried at 70 8C under vacuum for 16 h and Zn-MCM-41 was dried at 300 8C under vacuum for 6 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical and physical properties of the as-synthesized
catalysts The powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1a) of the as- synthesized sample exhibits four diffraction peaks correspond- ing to d (1 0 0) of 4.2437 nm, d (1 1 0) of 2.3480 nm, d (2 0 0) of 2.0487 nm and weak d (2 1 0), which are a typical MCM-41 XRD reflection pattern. The incorporation of HgO causes marked intensity decrease of the four peaks. However, the basal (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) diffraction peaks are clearly observed. This indicates that the structure of Zn-silica mesoporous sieves remains intact through the supporting procedure. With the increase of mercuric oxide loads, three XRD reflection peaks of introduced species are detected, as shown in Fig. 1b.
Mesopores of MCM-41 type materials can greatly expand the capabilities of heterogeneous catalysis [34]. The capillary condensation occurs inside the mesoporous channels, allowing a relatively high concentration of reactant molecules inside the mesoporous channels. Thus, when taking the mesoporous channels as the microreactors, the reaction would proceed as if it were carried out at higher partial pressure compared with most other catalytic solid surfaces. The N2 adsorption desorption isotherm of Zn-MCM-41 exhibits a typical capillary condensation step for mesopores in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.20.4 (Fig. 2). The sharpness and height of the capillary step indicate that the resulting materials have good mesopore structure ordering. A hysteresis loop is observed for the difference between desorption isotherm and adsorption isotherm cause mesopore capillary condensation. The introdu- cing of mercuric oxide leads to a marked loss of surface area.
However, the capillary condensation step and the hysteresis loop are observed in the adsorptiondesorption isotherm of HgO/Zn- MCM-41. This indicates that the loading of mercuric oxide causes little changes in the mesopore structure, which have been interpreted by the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The marked loss of surface area is due to partially shutting off two- dimensionalpore systemsofMCM-41inthewet impregnationof mercuric oxide precursors. Chemical composite of the as- synthesized catalyst was characterized by XPS. ZnO (Zn 2p3/2:
1023.0 eV) andHgO(Hg4d5/2: 361.6 eV)was detected (Fig.4a).
3.2. Bromine-mediated methane conversion and the role of
bromine in catalytic cycle As shown in Scheme 2, the involvement of bromine is the key mechanism for oxidative conversion of methane to C1 Fig. 1.

84 oxygenates. Two possible reaction cycles are proposed: the cycle I with MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and the cycle II with mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation. Time-on-stream (TOS) results are shown in Fig. 3.
At 1.5 h on the reaction stream, bromine (2.0 mmol Br2) is injected into a gasification chamber and conveyed into the catalyst column by feed gas. The presence of bromine in feed gas leads to a sharp increase in the methane conversion (Fig. 3a), which demonstrates the mediator role of bromine in the methane conversion. After reaching the maximum, the methane conversion decreases gradually and fluctuates around 10%. Before introducing bromine, carbon oxides are the main products under about 2% methane conversion. With the addition of bromine, the total selectivity to C1 oxygenates (formaldehyde, methanol, and dimethyl ether) increases greatly, which reaches the maximum value of 87.6% and gradually decreases with reaction run (Fig. 3b). In all process,bromine and methyl bromide are not detected in the outlet flow of the catalyst column. The role of Zn contents in the bromine- mediated process has been established [31]. As shown by Scheme 3, the involvement of ZnO multiplies the chance of scavenging the bromine from HBr and CBr functionality to yield the oxidized products. The moderate bromine metathesis rate of ZnBr2/ZnO pairs is an important mechanism for holding bromine in the catalyst column and the promoting effects of ZnBr2 upon CH bond bromination may also reduce the leaching of unreacted bromine.
The methane oxidation over general oxide catalysts requires high reaction temperature and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates is poor. The target products (CH3OH and/or H2CO) are less thermodynamically stable than methane and hence are further oxidized to carbon oxides. But such bromine-mediated methane conversion over mercuric oxide nanophases shows relatively high selectivity to C1 oxygenates at reaction temperature of 220 8C. As revealed by Scheme 2, there are two possible reaction routes. In the cycle I, methyl bromide is first formed, and then combined with active mercuric (II) sites to give MeHgBrn, which is the precursor of C1 oxygenates. For this mechanism, the bromine concentration in the reactant flow must be kept high enough to product methyl bromide to sustain the sequent conversion. The isolated mercuric (II) cation center combined with methyl can avoid the over-oxidation of products and increase the selectivity to C1 oxygenates. In the cycle II,mercuric hypobromite formed through the insertion of bromine into zigzag OHgOHgO chains, which releases the activated lattice oxygen atoms to form Br2O, shows high activity for methane oxidation. However, the over-oxidation of target products cannot be avoided and the total selectivity to C1 oxygenates is relatively low when the methane conversion is controlled by this mechanism. As revealed by the tendency of TOS data and product distribution with reaction run (Fig. 3),both mechanisms may occur in the bromine-mediated methane conversion. In the incipient stage after bromine introducing,there is high bromine concentration in the reaction flow and the main reaction routes is the cycle I. The conversion process shows high selectivity to C1 oxygenates, as observed in Fig. 3b.
However, bromine is gradually fixed into the mercuric oxide lattice with time on stream. The controlling mechanism transfers to the cycle II and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates decreases markedly.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements provide direct information about the role of bromine in the methane conversion. Fig. 4a shows XPS survey spectra of a fresh catalyst and three catalysts exposed to different feed gas. The samples attacked by bromine containing feed gas shows the formation of bromine compounds in the catalytic cycle. The specification of Br 3d peaks reveals the coexistence of two chemical states of bromine: HgBr2 (Br 3d: 70 eV) and Hg(OBr)2 (Br 3d: 73.8 eV) (Fig. 4b). Compared with HgBr2, the concentration of Fig. 3. (a) Time-on-stream data from catalytic activity tests on HgO/Zn-MCM- 41 (8 wt.%). The data are one-pass methane conversion, with error bar indicated.

85 Hg(OBr)2 is lower because of its high activity. This result demonstrates that methane oxidation via the mercuric sites activated by the insertion of bromine into zigzag mercuric oxide chains (the cycle II) occurs in the total bromine-mediated methane conversion. But the marked fluctuation of the selectivity during the incipient stage suggests a different controlling mechanism. Fig. 4c shows the C 1s XPS peaks of the samples exposed to the feed gas containing bromine. The peaks at binding energy of 284.8 eV are from adventitious carbon, which is inevitable in XPS determination. The catalyst on the reaction stream of Ar/CH4/O2/Br2 for 1.0 h shows two well defined C 1s peaks: adventitious carbon (284.8 eV) and MeHgBrn (282.6 eV), but the catalyst on the reaction stream of Ar/CH4/O2/Br2 for 3.0 h only shows the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon.
Meanwhile,the selectivity to
C1
oxygenates exhibits a gradually decrease (Fig. 3b). The disappearance of C 1s peak (MeHgBrn, 282.6 eV) with time on stream demonstrates the controlling mechanism gradually transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with time-on-stream.
Herein, it is concluded that both bromine-mediated routes described in the cycle I and the cycle II occur simultaneously in the methane conversion and the main mechanism transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with the gradual fixation of bromine into mercuric oxide lattice.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we present a novel bromine-mediated process over supported HgO nanophases for selective methane partial oxidation at relatively low reaction temperature. A transient high product selectivity to C1 oxygenates was observed under the methane conversion of 13%, and then the methane conversion and the selectivity to C1 oxygenates gradually decrease and fluctuate around 10% and 55%, respectively. This special methane conversion was applied as the model reaction to investigate the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle. Two reaction routes can be identified: the cycle I with MeHgBrn as the intermediate species and the cycle II with mercuric hypobromite as the active agent for methane oxidation. Both bromine-mediated routes occur simultaneously in the methane conversion and the main mechanism transfers from the cycle I to the cycle II with the gradual fixation of bromine into Fig. 4.
