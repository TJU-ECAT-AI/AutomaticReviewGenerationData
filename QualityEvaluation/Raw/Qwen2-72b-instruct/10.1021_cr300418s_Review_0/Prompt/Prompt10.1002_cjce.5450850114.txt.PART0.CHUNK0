I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

VOLUME 85, FEBRUARY 2007
THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING 127
F
undamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition) is a defi nitive instructional and reference text that has been written for a broad chemical science and engineering audience. The text has been authored with a balanced academic and industrial perspective of industrial catalysis by authors who have been instrumental in advancing the discipline. This book directly addresses the academic need for a comprehensive course text, while providing a level of information and detail for several industrially relevant processes that will be of particular interest to the practising chemist and engineer. The result is a very readable and comprehendible text for the engineer and chemist alike, which is based on a founda- tion of using fundamental aspects of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial design and optimization of industrial catalytic processes.
The book is separated into two sections, and begins with a summary of reaction engineering and catalysis fundamentals (chapters 15), followed by relevant industrial examples of heterogeneously catalyzed processes (chapters 613). In this regard, the text could easily serve as the required text for two academic courses, one in heterogeneous catalyst fundamentals and the second in industrial catalytic processes. This format also allows the experienced and practising chemist and engineer to quickly locate information of interest, similar to a traditional handbook format. Although the book does not labour through every detail of the various topics presented, the text is superbly

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, and what are the resulting implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
