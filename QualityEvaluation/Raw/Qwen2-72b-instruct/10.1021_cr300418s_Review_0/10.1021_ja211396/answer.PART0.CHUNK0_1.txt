[1] "The performance of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis is closely related to their size and morphology as well as to interactions with the oxide support."
[2] "Several authors have highlighted the particular relevance of flat metal deposits for various reactions."
[3] "Goodman et al., for example, found bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films to be an order of magnitude more active in low-temperature CO oxidation than their mono- or multilayer equivalents."
[4] "A similar conclusion was drawn from an electron microscopy study on Au/FeOx catalysts."
[5] "Also in the propanol oxidation over alumina-supported Pt, raft-like particles turned out to be the most reactive."
[6] "An explanation for the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis is the specific role of the particle perimeter that enables a simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support."
[7] "Given the importance of the particle geometry, several attempts have been made to tailor the shape of metal deposits on oxide supports."
[8] "On most bulk oxides, the growth of ad-metals follows the VolmerWeber regime, resulting in compact 3D particles with large height to diameter (aspect) ratios."
[9] "A 2D growth of metals has been found on a few strongly interacting systems, e.g. on polar and highly defective oxide surfaces."
[10] "The formation of monolayer islands is also revealed on various thin-film supports, where a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands reinforces the metaloxide adhesion."
[11] "However, all approaches for shaping metal deposits presented so far are restricted to specific oxide systems and therefore unsuitable to optimize particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides, as used in heterogeneous catalysis."
[12] "This work demonstrates how doping of an oxide material might be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles."
[13] "For this purpose, we have prepared CaO films of 50 ML thickness via Ca vapor deposition onto a Mo(001) single crystal in 5 × 107 mbar of O2."
[14] "The doping was performed by adding defined quantities of Li and/or Mo to the reaction gas used for film preparation."
[15] "Whereas Li is an undervalent dopant, Mo adopts a higher charge state than the initial Ca2+ and thus acts as electron donor."
[16] "To avoid segregation of the dopants to the surface, the films were capped with 10 layers of pristine CaO."
[17] "This particular thickness was chosen to enable diffusion of the dopants into a near-surface region without enriching them on top of the oxide layer."
[18] "The preparation was completed by annealing of the film to 900 K in ultrahigh vacuum in order to stimulate its crystallization."
[19] "Higher temperatures were avoided as they triggered Li desorption from the film."
[20] "The presence of Mo dopants in the CaO films has been confirmed with Auger spectroscopy, revealing the characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy."
[21] "In contrast, the Li impurities could only be probed indirectly via their impact on the energy position of the CaO bands, as deduced from STM conductance measurements."
[22] "On pristine films, the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges are detected at 5.0 and +2.0 V, respectively, demonstrating a substantial downshift of the midgap position with respect to the Fermi level."
[23] "The shift reflects the development of a strong interface dipole between the basic CaO film and the electronegative Mo support."
[24] "Upon Li doping, the bands move to higher energies, reaching VB = 4.0 V and CB = +3.0 V at 8% Li content."
[25] "The rigid upshift is due to a back transfer of electrons from Mo to the CaO film in order to fill the holes created by Li+ ions located on Ca2+ substitutional sites."
[26] "As a result, the positive dipole at the CaO/Mo interface diminishes and the CaO midgap position moves closer to the Fermi level."
[27] "The band shift is fully reversible, and the original situation is restored when removing the Li from the oxide film upon heating to 1050 K."
[28] "Not surprisingly, the opposite effect is observed for CaOMo, as the Mo dopants adopt a higher charge state and release electrons to the lattice."
[29] "Transfer of these excess charges to the metal support reinforces the initial interface dipole and promotes a further downshift of the bands to VB = 5.5 V and CB = +1.5 V."
[30] "We note that only dopants close to the interface participate in this electron transfer, while near-surface species retain their original charge state due to the large tunneling barrier to the Mo metal."
[31] "The latter might however be able to donate electrons to adsorbates."
[32] "To explore this possibility, we have dosed small amounts of gold, which is a good electron acceptor, onto the doped CaO films."
[33] "An electron transfer might be derived in this case from the equilibrium shape of the Au deposits, as negatively charged gold was found to grow into 2D islands on various oxide supports."
[34] "On pristine CaO, gold develops 3D deposits, as expected from its weak interaction with the wide-gap insulator."
[35] "Inserting 4% of Mo into the CaO matrix changes the particle shapes from 3D to 2D."
[36] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."
[37] "As long as the Li content is lower than the one of Mo, most of the Au deposits remain 2D and only particles along the CaO dislocation lines switch back to a 3D geometry."
[38] "With increasing Li concentration, the fraction of 2D islands decreases with respect to the 3D deposits."
[39] "Once the Li doping level exceeds the one of Mo, the original shape distribution of bare CaO is restored and only the particle density is somewhat higher due to the lower surface quality of CaOLiMo films."
[40] "We note that pure Li doping has almost no effect on the Au growth characteristic."
[41] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[42] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge."
[43] "This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."
[44] "As a result, the Mo dopant becomes oxidized while the Au atom takes a negative charge."
[45] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion."
[46] "In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."
[47] "In contrast to Mo, Li is a charge acceptor as it lacks one valence electron with respect to the divalent Ca."
[48] "It thus creates energetically costive holes in the 2p orbitals of adjacent O ions that can be filled by electrons from the Mo codopants."
[49] "The presence of Li in CaOMo films therefore triggers charge-compensation effects between the dopants, reducing the number of electrons that are available for transfer into the Au deposits."
[50] "The absence of excess electrons now forces the gold to adopt its original 3D growth regime, in agreement with the experimental findings."
[51] "The geometry crossover affects primarily particles along the CaO dislocation lines, suggesting that the line defects are the preferred binding sites of Li."
[52] "Alternatively, additional electron acceptors might be present along those defects, e.g. O vacancies or structural electron traps, which also disrupt the charge flow into the gold."
[53] "We have no indication of positive Au charging if only Li dopants are present in the CaO films."
[54] "While this observation might be unexpected at first glance, it is readily explained by alternative routes to remove the unfavorable holes created by the Li dopants."
[55] "The required electrons are provided by either O defects (F0 or F2+ centers) or donor-type adsorbates in the rest gas, e.g. H2 or H2O."
[56] "In any case, the charge imbalance due to Li incorporation will be removed long before the Au interacts with the surface."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by changing the growth behavior of metal deposits on the oxide surface. This can lead to the formation of flat metal deposits, which have been shown to be more active in certain reactions than 3D particles. For example, bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films were found to be an order of magnitude more active in low-temperature CO oxidation than their mono- or multilayer equivalents. Similarly, raft-like particles of Pt on alumina were found to be the most reactive in propanol oxidation. The specific role of the particle perimeter in enabling a simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support explains the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis. Doping of an oxide material can be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles. In this study, doping of CaO films with Mo and Li was used to tailor the growth behavior of Au deposits. Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the Au, leading to the formation of 2D islands. Li, on the other hand, creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal, reinstating the initial 3D growth regime of Au. The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants result in different growth morphologies, with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion. This work demonstrates how oxide doping can be used to optimize particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides, which is important for enhancing catalytic activity and improving industrially relevant reactions.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过改变金属沉积物在氧化物表面的生长行为来修改表面化学并破坏化学键。这可能导致形成平面金属沉积物，与3D粒子相比，在某些反应中显示出更高的活性。例如，发现二氧化钛薄膜上的双层Au筏在低温CO氧化中的活性比其单层或多层等效物高一个数量级。同样，发现氧化铝上的筏状Pt粒子在丙醇氧化中是最具反应性的。颗粒周界的特定作用在于使吸附物能够同时与金属和氧化物支撑物相互作用，这解释了金属颗粒在催化作用中的形状依赖性的显著性。可以通过掺杂氧化物材料来控制金属吸附颗粒的平衡形状。在本研究中，通过Mo和Li掺杂CaO薄膜来调整Au沉积物的生长行为。Mo充当电子供体，为转移到Au中提供过剩电荷，导致形成2D岛屿。另一方面，Li在氧化物晶格中创建电子陷阱，中断向金属的电荷流动，重新安装Au的初始3D生长模式。在掺杂剂存在下Au的不同电荷状态导致不同的生长形态，带负电荷的Au由于增强的界面粘附而倾向于2D模式。这项工作展示了如何通过氧化物掺杂来优化常规块体氧化物上的颗粒几何形状，这对于增强催化活性和改善工业相关反应至关重要。
