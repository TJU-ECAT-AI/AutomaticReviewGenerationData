[1] "The performance of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis is closely related to their size and morphology as well as to interactions with the oxide support."
[2] "Several authors have highlighted the particular relevance of flat metal deposits for various reactions."
[3] "Goodman et al., for example, found bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films to be an order of magnitude more active in low-temperature CO oxidation than their mono- or multilayer equivalents."
[4] "A similar conclusion was drawn from an electron microscopy study on Au/FeOx catalysts."
[5] "Also in the propanol oxidation over alumina-supported Pt, raft-like particles turned out to be the most reactive."
[6] "An explanation for the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis is the specific role of the particle perimeter that enables a simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support."
[7] "Given the importance of the particle geometry, several attempts have been made to tailor the shape of metal deposits on oxide supports."
[8] "On most bulk oxides, the growth of ad-metals follows the VolmerWeber regime, resulting in compact 3D particles with large height to diameter (aspect) ratios."
[9] "A 2D growth of metals has been found on a few strongly interacting systems, e.g. on polar and highly defective oxide surfaces."
[10] "The formation of monolayer islands is also revealed on various thin-film supports, where a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands reinforces the metaloxide adhesion."
[11] "However, all approaches for shaping metal deposits presented so far are restricted to specific oxide systems and therefore unsuitable to optimize particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides, as used in heterogeneous catalysis."
[12] "This work demonstrates how doping of an oxide material might be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles."
[13] "For this purpose, we have prepared CaO films of 50 ML thickness via Ca vapor deposition onto a Mo(001) single crystal in 5 × 107 mbar of O2."
[14] "The doping was performed by adding defined quantities of Li and/or Mo to the reaction gas used for film preparation."
[15] "Whereas Li is an undervalent dopant, Mo adopts a higher charge state than the initial Ca2+ and thus acts as electron donor."
[16] "To avoid segregation of the dopants to the surface, the films were capped with 10 layers of pristine CaO."
[17] "This particular thickness was chosen to enable diffusion of the dopants into a near-surface region without enriching them on top of the oxide layer."
[18] "The preparation was completed by annealing of the film to 900 K in ultrahigh vacuum in order to stimulate its crystallization."
[19] "Higher temperatures were avoided as they triggered Li desorption from the film."
[20] "Four different samples have been prepared in this way, namely pristine CaO, Mo-doped (CaOMo), Li-doped (CaOLi), and codoped (CaOLiMo) films."
[21] "They all display a sharp (1 × 1) LEED pattern as well as atomically flat and defect poor surfaces in low-temperature STM measurements."
[22] "The main defects are dislocation lines that compensate for the misfit strain between the oxide film and the Mo support."
[23] "Point defects, on the other hand, are hardly detected in the STM, suggesting that the capping layer indeed inhibits segregation of the dopants to the surface."
[24] "Only the spatial extension of oxide terraces was found to change for different doping procedures, with the smallest terrace sizes occurring for CaOLi."
[25] "The presence of Mo dopants in the CaO films has been confirmed with Auger spectroscopy, revealing the characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy."
[26] "In contrast, the Li impurities could only be probed indirectly via their impact on the energy position of the CaO bands, as deduced from STM conductance measurements."
[27] "On pristine films, the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges are detected at 5.0 and +2.0 V, respectively, demonstrating a substantial downshift of the midgap position with respect to the Fermi level."
[28] "The shift reflects the development of a strong interface dipole between the basic CaO film and the electronegative Mo support."
[29] "Upon Li doping, the bands move to higher energies, reaching VB = 4.0 V and CB = +3.0 V at 8% Li content."
[30] "The rigid upshift is due to a back transfer of electrons from Mo to the CaO film in order to fill the holes created by Li+ ions located on Ca2+ substitutional sites."
[31] "As a result, the positive dipole at the CaO/Mo interface diminishes and the CaO midgap position moves closer to the Fermi level."
[32] "The band shift is fully reversible, and the original situation is restored when removing the Li from the oxide film upon heating to 1050 K."
[33] "Not surprisingly, the opposite effect is observed for CaOMo, as the Mo dopants adopt a higher charge state and release electrons to the lattice."
[34] "Transfer of these excess charges to the metal support reinforces the initial interface dipole and promotes a further downshift of the bands to VB = 5.5 V and CB = +1.5 V."
[35] "We note that only dopants close to the interface participate in this electron transfer, while near-surface species retain their original charge state due to the large tunneling barrier to the Mo metal."
[36] "The latter might however be able to donate electrons to adsorbates."
[37] "To explore this possibility, we have dosed small amounts of gold, which is a good electron acceptor, onto the doped CaO films."
[38] "An electron transfer might be derived in this case from the equilibrium shape of the Au deposits, as negatively charged gold was found to grow into 2D islands on various oxide supports."
[39] "On pristine CaO, gold develops 3D deposits, as expected from its weak interaction with the wide-gap insulator."
[40] "Inserting 4% of Mo into the CaO matrix changes the particle shapes from 3D to 2D."
[41] "The 2D deposits appear as faint depressions in the STM images, because electron transport is more efficient into the bare CaO than into the Au islands at high sample bias."
[42] "The reason for this contrast inversion is the presence of low-lying vacuum states with high electron transmissibility above the CaO surface that are not available above the metal islands."
[43] "The regular contrast with the Au deposits appearing bright is only revealed below 3.0 V sample bias; however low-bias tunneling through a 50 ML thick CaO film is challenging."
[44] "The aspect ratio of Au islands on CaOMo films has been determined with (0.07  0.02) at 6.0 V sample bias, which corresponds to a Au monolayer."
[45] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."
[46] "As long as the Li content is lower than the one of Mo, most of the Au deposits remain 2D and only particles along the CaO dislocation lines switch back to a 3D geometry."
[47] "This leads to a bimodal particle-shape distribution characterized by two well-separated maxima."
[48] "With increasing Li concentration, the fraction of 2D islands decreases with respect to the 3D deposits."
[49] "Once the Li doping level exceeds the one of Mo, the original shape distribution of bare CaO is restored and only the particle density is somewhat higher due to the lower surface quality of CaOLiMo films."
[50] "We note that pure Li doping has almost no effect on the Au growth characteristic."
[51] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."
[52] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge."
[53] "This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."
[54] "As a result, the Mo dopant becomes oxidized while the Au atom takes a negative charge."
[55] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion."
[56] "In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."
[57] "In contrast to Mo, Li is a charge acceptor as it lacks one valence electron with respect to the divalent Ca."
[58] "It thus creates energetically costive holes in the 2p orbitals of adjacent O ions that can be filled by electrons from the Mo codopants."
[59] "The presence of Li in CaOMo films therefore triggers charge-compensation effects between the dopants, reducing the number of electrons that are available for transfer into the Au deposits."
[60] "The absence of excess electrons now forces the gold to adopt its original 3D growth regime, in agreement with the experimental findings."
[61] "The geometry crossover affects primarily particles along the CaO dislocation lines, suggesting that the line defects are the preferred binding sites of Li."
[62] "Alternatively, additional electron acceptors might be present along those defects, e.g. O vacancies or structural electron traps, which also disrupt the charge flow into the gold."
[63] "We have no indication of positive Au charging if only Li dopants are present in the CaO films."
[64] "While this observation might be unexpected at first glance, it is readily explained by alternative routes to remove the unfavorable holes created by the Li dopants."
[65] "The required electrons are provided by either O defects (F0 or F2+ centers) or donor-type adsorbates in the rest gas, e.g. H2 or H2O."
[66] "In any case, the charge imbalance due to Li incorporation will be removed long before the Au interacts with the surface."
[67] "In conclusion, we have successfully tailored the shape of Au particles by doping a CaO support with Mo or Li impurities."
[68] "Inserting overvalent Mo species leads to the growth of 2D metal islands that are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions."
[69] "Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants."
[70] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."
[71] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[72] "It also illustrates that codoping, being a widely proposed strategy in the catalytic literature, results in internal charge compensation that destroys the desired effect."

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by altering the size and morphology of metal particles, which are crucial for catalytic activity. Doping with Mo or Li impurities can change the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles, leading to different growth morphologies. Mo acts as an electron donor, providing excess charges to be transferred into the metal, while Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal. This results in a morphology crossover from 3D to 2D growth of metals on the oxide surface. The different charge states of the metal in the presence of the dopants lead to distinct growth morphologies, with anionic metal favoring a 2D mode due to enhanced interface adhesion. This demonstrates how oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts, which can have implications for catalytic activity enhancement, the nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过改变金属颗粒的大小和形态来修改表面化学并破坏化学键，这对于催化活性至关重要。通过Mo或Li杂质的掺杂可以改变金属吸附颗粒的平衡形状，导致不同的生长形态。Mo充当电子供体，为金属提供过剩电荷，而Li在氧化物晶格中产生电子陷阱，中断向金属的电荷流动。这导致金属在氧化物表面的生长形态从3D到2D的转变。金属在掺杂剂存在下的不同电荷状态导致独特的生长形态，带负电的金属由于增强的界面粘附而倾向于2D模式。这展示了如何通过氧化物掺杂来调整吸附颗粒在支撑金属催化剂上的平衡几何形状，这可能对催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置以及在工业相关反应中的潜在改进产生影响。

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding by changing the growth behavior of metal deposits on the oxide surface. This can lead to the formation of flat metal deposits, which have been shown to be more active in certain reactions than 3D particles. For example, bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films were found to be an order of magnitude more active in low-temperature CO oxidation than their mono- or multilayer equivalents. Similarly, raft-like particles of Pt on alumina were found to be the most reactive in propanol oxidation. The specific role of the particle perimeter in enabling a simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support explains the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis. Doping of an oxide material can be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles. In this study, doping of CaO films with Mo and Li was used to tailor the growth behavior of Au deposits. Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the Au, leading to the formation of 2D islands. Li, on the other hand, creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal, reinstating the initial 3D growth regime of Au. The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants result in different growth morphologies, with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion. This work demonstrates how oxide doping can be used to optimize particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides, which is important for enhancing catalytic activity and improving industrially relevant reactions.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过改变金属沉积物在氧化物表面的生长行为来修改表面化学并破坏化学键。这可能导致形成平面金属沉积物，与3D粒子相比，在某些反应中显示出更高的活性。例如，发现二氧化钛薄膜上的双层Au筏在低温CO氧化中的活性比其单层或多层等效物高一个数量级。同样，发现氧化铝上的筏状Pt粒子在丙醇氧化中是最具反应性的。颗粒周界的特定作用在于使吸附物能够同时与金属和氧化物支撑物相互作用，这解释了金属颗粒在催化作用中的形状依赖性的显著性。可以通过掺杂氧化物材料来控制金属吸附颗粒的平衡形状。在本研究中，通过Mo和Li掺杂CaO薄膜来调整Au沉积物的生长行为。Mo充当电子供体，为转移到Au中提供过剩电荷，导致形成2D岛屿。另一方面，Li在氧化物晶格中创建电子陷阱，中断向金属的电荷流动，重新安装Au的初始3D生长模式。在掺杂剂存在下Au的不同电荷状态导致不同的生长形态，带负电荷的Au由于增强的界面粘附而倾向于2D模式。这项工作展示了如何通过氧化物掺杂来优化常规块体氧化物上的颗粒几何形状，这对于增强催化活性和改善工业相关反应至关重要。

1.Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding, leading to changes in catalytic activity. The performance of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis is closely related to their size, morphology, and interactions with the oxide support. Flat metal deposits have been found to be more active in certain reactions, such as low-temperature CO oxidation and propanol oxidation over alumina-supported Pt. The particle perimeter plays a specific role in enabling simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support. Doping of an oxide material can be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles. For example, doping CaO films with Mo and Li can alter the growth behavior of gold deposits from 3D to 2D and back to 3D, respectively. This is due to charge transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal. Mo acts as an electron donor, providing excess charges to be transferred into the gold, while Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal. The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants result in different growth morphologies, with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to enhanced interface adhesion.

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以改变表面化学并破坏化学键，从而导致催化活性的变化。金属颗粒在异相催化中的性能与其尺寸、形态以及与氧化物载体的相互作用密切相关。平面金属沉积物在某些反应中被发现更活跃，例如低温CO氧化和氧化丙醇在氧化铝支撑的Pt上。颗粒周长在使吸附物与金属和氧化物载体同时相互作用中起着特定的作用。可以通过掺杂氧化物材料来控制金属吸附颗粒的平衡形状。例如，通过Mo和Li掺杂CaO薄膜可以改变金沉积物的生长行为，从3D到2D，再回到3D。这是由于掺杂剂与吸附金属之间的电荷转移过程。Mo作为电子供体，向金提供过量的电荷，而Li在氧化物晶格中产生电子陷阱，中断向金属的电荷流动。在掺杂剂存在下，Au的不同电荷状态导致不同的生长形态，带负电的金由于增强的界面粘附而倾向于2D模式。

[1] "The performance of metal particles in heterogeneous catalysis is closely related to their size and morphology as well as to interactions with the oxide support."
[2] "Several authors have highlighted the particular relevance of flat metal deposits for various reactions."
[3] "Goodman et al., for example, found bilayer Au rafts on titania thin films to be an order of magnitude more active in low-temperature CO oxidation than their mono- or multilayer equivalents."
[4] "A similar conclusion was drawn from an electron microscopy study on Au/FeOx catalysts."
[5] "Also in the propanol oxidation over alumina-supported Pt, raft-like particles turned out to be the most reactive."
[6] "An explanation for the pronounced shape-dependence of metal particles in catalysis is the specific role of the particle perimeter that enables a simultaneous interaction of adsorbates with the metal and the oxide support."
[7] "Given the importance of the particle geometry, several attempts have been made to tailor the shape of metal deposits on oxide supports."
[8] "On most bulk oxides, the growth of ad-metals follows the VolmerWeber regime, resulting in compact 3D particles with large height to diameter (aspect) ratios."
[9] "A 2D growth of metals has been found on a few strongly interacting systems, e.g. on polar and highly defective oxide surfaces."
[10] "The formation of monolayer islands is also revealed on various thin-film supports, where a spontaneous charge transfer into the ad-islands reinforces the metaloxide adhesion."
[11] "However, all approaches for shaping metal deposits presented so far are restricted to specific oxide systems and therefore unsuitable to optimize particle geometries on conventional bulk oxides, as used in heterogeneous catalysis."
[12] "This work demonstrates how doping of an oxide material might be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles."
[13] "For this purpose, we have prepared CaO films of 50 ML thickness via Ca vapor deposition onto a Mo(001) single crystal in 5 × 107 mbar of O2."
[14] "The doping was performed by adding defined quantities of Li and/or Mo to the reaction gas used for film preparation."
[15] "Whereas Li is an undervalent dopant, Mo adopts a higher charge state than the initial Ca2+ and thus acts as electron donor."
[16] "To avoid segregation of the dopants to the surface, the films were capped with 10 layers of pristine CaO."
[17] "This particular thickness was chosen to enable diffusion of the dopants into a near-surface region without enriching them on top of the oxide layer."
[18] "The preparation was completed by annealing of the film to 900 K in ultrahigh vacuum in order to stimulate its crystallization."
[19] "Higher temperatures were avoided as they triggered Li desorption from the film."
[20] "Four different samples have been prepared in this way, namely pristine CaO, Mo-doped (CaOMo), Li-doped (CaOLi), and codoped (CaOLiMo) films."
[21] "They all display a sharp (1 × 1) LEED pattern as well as atomically flat and defect poor surfaces in low-temperature STM measurements."
[22] "The main defects are dislocation lines that compensate for the misfit strain between the oxide film and the Mo support."
[23] "Point defects, on the other hand, are hardly detected in the STM, suggesting that the capping layer indeed inhibits segregation of the dopants to the surface."
[24] "Only the spatial extension of oxide terraces was found to change for different doping procedures, with the smallest terrace sizes occurring for CaOLi."
[25] "The presence of Mo dopants in the CaO films has been confirmed with Auger spectroscopy, revealing the characteristic Mo transitions at 200 eV kinetic energy."
[26] "In contrast, the Li impurities could only be probed indirectly via their impact on the energy position of the CaO bands, as deduced from STM conductance measurements."
[27] "On pristine films, the valence (VB) and conduction band (CB) edges are detected at 5.0 and +2.0 V, respectively, demonstrating a substantial downshift of the midgap position with respect to the Fermi level."
[28] "The shift reflects the development of a strong interface dipole between the basic CaO film and the electronegative Mo support."
[29] "Upon Li doping, the bands move to higher energies, reaching VB = 4.0 V and CB = +3.0 V at 8% Li content."
[30] "The rigid upshift is due to a back transfer of electrons from Mo to the CaO film in order to fill the holes created by Li+ ions located on Ca2+ substitutional sites."
[31] "As a result, the positive dipole at the CaO/Mo interface diminishes and the CaO midgap position moves closer to the Fermi level."
[32] "The band shift is fully reversible, and the original situation is restored when removing the Li from the oxide film upon heating to 1050 K."
[33] "Not surprisingly, the opposite effect is observed for CaOMo, as the Mo dopants adopt a higher charge state and release electrons to the lattice."
[34] "Transfer of these excess charges to the metal support reinforces the initial interface dipole and promotes a further downshift of the bands to VB = 5.5 V and CB = +1.5 V."
[35] "We note that only dopants close to the interface participate in this electron transfer, while near-surface species retain their original charge state due to the large tunneling barrier to the Mo metal."
[36] "The latter might however be able to donate electrons to adsorbates."
[37] "To explore this possibility, we have dosed small amounts of gold, which is a good electron acceptor, onto the doped CaO films."
[38] "An electron transfer might be derived in this case from the equilibrium shape of the Au deposits, as negatively charged gold was found to grow into 2D islands on various oxide supports."
[39] "On pristine CaO, gold develops 3D deposits, as expected from its weak interaction with the wide-gap insulator."
[40] "Inserting 4% of Mo into the CaO matrix changes the particle shapes from 3D to 2D."
[41] "The 2D deposits appear as faint depressions in the STM images, because electron transport is more efficient into the bare CaO than into the Au islands at high sample bias."
[42] "The reason for this contrast inversion is the presence of low-lying vacuum states with high electron transmissibility above the CaO surface that are not available above the metal islands."
[43] "The regular contrast with the Au deposits appearing bright is only revealed below 3.0 V sample bias; however low-bias tunneling through a 50 ML thick CaO film is challenging."
[44] "The aspect ratio of Au islands on CaOMo films has been determined with (0.07  0.02) at 6.0 V sample bias, which corresponds to a Au monolayer."
[45] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."
[46] "As long as the Li content is lower than the one of Mo, most of the Au deposits remain 2D and only particles along the CaO dislocation lines switch back to a 3D geometry."

[67] "In conclusion, we have successfully tailored the shape of Au particles by doping a CaO support with Mo or Li impurities."
[68] "Inserting overvalent Mo species leads to the growth of 2D metal islands that are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions."
[69] "Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants."
[70] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."
[71] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[72] "It also illustrates that codoping, being a widely proposed strategy in the catalytic literature, results in internal charge compensation that destroys the desired effect."

1.金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过改变金属颗粒的大小和形态来修改表面化学和破坏化学键，这与它们的催化活性密切相关。这是因为金属颗粒在异相催化中的性能受到它们与氧化物载体相互作用的影响。例如，平面金属沉积物在某些反应中表现出更高的活性，如在二氧化钛薄膜上的双层Au筏上进行的低温CO氧化，Au/FeOx催化剂，以及在氧化铝支撑的Pt上的丙醇氧化。颗粒周界在使吸附物同时与金属和氧化物载体相互作用方面起着特定的作用，这解释了金属颗粒在催化作用中对形状的显著依赖性。人们尝试过调整金属沉积物在氧化物载体上的形状，但大多数方法都局限于特定的氧化物系统，因此不适合优化在异相催化中使用的常规块状氧化物上的颗粒几何形状。这项工作展示了如何通过掺杂氧化物材料来控制金属吸附颗粒的平衡形状。通过在Mo(001)单晶上制备含有定义数量的Li和/或Mo掺杂剂的CaO薄膜，作者能够观察到在掺杂CaO薄膜上Au颗粒几何形状的变化，这可以通过掺杂剂和吸附金属之间的电荷转移过程来解释。CaO宿主中的Mo杂质采用+2电荷状态，可以将一个电子转移到Au 6s亲和水平，导致由杂质离子的电子转移稳定化的2D金属岛的生长。相反，Li是一个电荷接受者，它在相邻O离子的2p轨道中产生能量成本高的空穴，这些空穴可以被Mo共掺杂剂的电子填充，触发掺杂剂之间的电荷补偿效应，减少可用于转移到Au沉积物中的电子数量。由于缺乏多余的电子，黄金被迫采用其原始的3D生长模式。几何形状的交叉主要影响CaO位错线上的颗粒，这表明线缺陷是Li的首选结合位点。这项研究阐明了如何通过掺杂氧化物载体来塑造金属吸附颗粒，同时也说明了在催化文献中广泛提出的共掺杂策略会导致内部电荷补偿，破坏预期的效果。
