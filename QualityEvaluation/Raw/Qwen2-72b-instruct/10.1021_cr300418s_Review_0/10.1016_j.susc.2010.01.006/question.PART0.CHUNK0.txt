at low coverages, and forms thin films at 2 monolayer equivalents (MLE) of iron. Two types of ordered superstructures were observed on the Fe3O4 particles with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å, respectively.
As the Fe3O4 particles form more continuous films, the 50 Å feature was the predominant superstruc- ture observed. The Fe3O4 structures at all coverages show a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in the atomically resolved STM images. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
Iron and iron-oxide based catalysts are important materials uti- lized in many industrial processes, such as the FischerTropsch reaction, the synthesis of styrene, and gas-sensing applications [13]. Iron has two variable oxidation states, Fe2+ and Fe3+, and forms three natural oxides with different stoichiometries and crys- tal structures: FeO (wstite), Fe3O4 (magnetite), and a-Fe2O3 (hematite) [4]. There are also two other artificially synthesized oxi- des, known as c-Fe2O3 (maghemite) and e-Fe2O3, respectively [4].
The chemical and catalytic properties of iron-oxide depend on the specific phase of the oxides which are dictated by the oxidation states and associated crystal structures. This difference is illus- trated by the experimental observation that Fe3O4(1 1 1) and a- Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) are capable of chemically adsorbing ethylbenzene and styrene, whereas FeO(1 1 1) is inert toward both molecules [1]. In addition, a-Fe2O3 is the most active oxide for the dehydro- genation of ethylbenzene to styrene among all the studied Fe-oxide phases [1].There have been many studies on Fe-oxide single crystals [5 14]. Epitaxial Fe-oxide thin films have also been grown on single crystal metal surfaces, including Pt(1 1 1) [1521] and Ru(0 0 0 1) [22]. Depending on the growth conditions such as O2 pressure, oxi- dation temperature and Fe coverage, one can prepare films of FeO(1 1 1), Fe3O4(1 1 1), and a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) on these single crys- tal surfaces. The growth of epitaxial Fe-oxide thin films on metal surfaces is motivated by some of the technical problems some- times associated with using the single crystal oxides, such as the presence of uncontrolled impurities and low conductivities. A pho- toemission study has suggested that these iron oxide thin films are indeed electronically equivalent to the corresponding bulk materi- als [16].
Recently, we have demonstrated the selective growth and char- acterization of FeO(1 1 1) and a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) nanoparticles and thin films on the herringbone reconstructed Au(1 1 1) surface [23,24]. The FeO nanoparticles adopt a two-dimensional, bilayer structure consisting of Fe(1 1 1) and O(1 1 1) planes [23], while the a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles have a more three-dimensional struc- ture with an O-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface [24]. In comparison to studies on low-index and stepped Fe-oxide single crystals, the nanoparticles grown on metal surfaces serve as model catalysts which preserve many important features of real catalysts, namely edges, kinked steps, missing atoms, and other structural defects.
These features can be difficult to reproduce in single crystal sys- tems and are critical factors which govern the reactivity of real world heterogeneous catalysts.
In the present work, we demonstrate the preparation and char- acterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films on Au(1 1 1). We are interested in Fe3O4 because it is believed to be a key intermediate 0039-6028/$ - see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

This transformation is believed to occur when Fe2O3 is re- duced to Fe3O4 with the help of Cu or K promoters, which is then carburized into Fe-carbide. The final FischerTropsch catalyst is a complex, heterogeneous, mixture of Fe, Fe-oxides, Fe-carbides, Cu and/or K promoters, and other structural additives. Thus, the suc- cessful production of Fe3O4 nanoparticles may provide a platform to study Fe-carbide formation and to characterize its structure and reactivity of Fe-carbide materials using an assortment of sur- face science techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
We show that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles can be prepared by reducing a-Fe2O3 through a simple ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) annealing procedure. The UHV annealing reduces oxides by remov- ing or desorbing oxygen from the system. Recently, the reduction of MoO3 nanostructures grown on Au(1 1 1) was achieved by annealing the oxide in UHV at 650 K, generating one-dimensional oxygen vacancies associated with the formation of an Mo5+ state [26]. In our current work, the reduction of a-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 has been proposed and is supported by XPS. STM has also been used to characterize the morphology of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles formed during this reduction. The effect of Fe3O4 coverage on the morphol- ogy of the particles and films is also presented in this work.
2. Experimental method
All experiments were performed in a commercial UHV chamber from Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH. This chamber is equipped with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) [23]. The base pressure was main- tained at 3  1010 mbar.
The growth and characterization of a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and films on Au(1 1 1) has been described in detail elsewhere [24]. In this work, we used a slightly modified procedure. Briefly, prior to iron deposition, the Au(1 1 1) surface (Princeton Scientific Corp.) was cleaned by cycles of Ar+ sputtering (P = 1  106 mbar,
1.5 keV) at 300 K, followed by annealing at 700 K for 10 min. Iron
was then deposited on the clean Au(1 1 1) surface at room temper- ature using an electron-beam assisted evaporator (Omicron EFM3T) from a rod material (Good fellow, 2.0 mm, 99.99%), fol- lowed by heating in NO2 (directly introduced on the sample plate through a 1 = 4 stainless steel tube, chamber pressure during dosing 3  108 mbar) from room temperature to 700 K (heating rate
0.3 K/s). NO2 (research grade) was used as received and without
further purification.
The coverage of a-Fe2O3 on Au(1 1 1) is noted as a monolayer equivalent of Fe (MLE), referring to the atomic ratio of Fe and Au (only the surface Au atoms are taken into account) used to make the oxide. We also refer to the Fe3O4 formed from the a-Fe2O3 using this definition of coverage. The MLE coverage was deter- mined from the XPS data collected during Fe deposition on the clean Au(1 1 1) surface. Corrections to the XPS data were made for the atomic sensitivity factors (ASF) and the inelastic mean free path (IMFP), as described in our previous study [24].
XPS measurements were collected using an Mg Ka X-ray source (1253.6 eV, 300 W) and a hemispherical analyzer with pass energy of 20 eV at room temperature. The binding energy (BE) was cali- brated by Au 4f7/2 = 83.8 eV for each spectrum. All STM measure- ments were performed at room temperature in constant current mode using etched W tips. The STM was calibrated using the steps on Au(1 1 1) and the literature value for the height of these steps of
2.4 Å [27,28]. All STM images were processed using the Scanning
Probe Imaging Processor (SPIP) brand software including plane corrections.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the a-Fe2O3 structures grown on Au(1 1 1) is shown in Fig. 1a. Briefly, a-Fe2O3 adopts a three-dimensional struc- ture with a height of 5 Å. At the coverage of 1 MLE, most of the a- Fe2O3 particles coalesce to form irregularly shaped islands, with boundaries showing contrast differences in the STM image; while a small portion still appear as individual particles. According to our previous study [24], these a-Fe2O3 structures appear to have an O-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface, showing a hexagonal unit cell with a lattice constant of 3 Å in the atomically resolved STM images.
Fig. 2a shows the XP spectra of the Fe 2p and O 1s regions of 1 MLE a-Fe2O3 grown on Au(1 1 1). The binding energy (BE) of the Fe 2p3/2 peak is located at 710.9 eV, in agreement with the literature value of a-Fe2O3 [29,30]. More importantly, the shakeup satellite peak at 719 eV (marked with a dashed line in the Fe 2p region),a characteristic for the Fe3+ species [31] typically seen in Fe2O3,is present in the XP spectrum. The O 1s peak is located at
529.7 eV. The atomic ratio of O and Fe is estimated to be 1.5:1,
based on integrated XPS signal intensities after taking the atomic sensitivity factors (ASF) into account, consistent with the a-Fe2O3 stoichiometry.
The morphology changes after annealing the a-Fe2O3 structures at 750 K for 10 min. Although most structures still appear as irreg- ularly shaped islands on Au(1 1 1), the structures have sharper and straighter edges than before this annealing step (Fig. 1b). Most Fig. 1.

noticeably, the larger structures display an ordered hexagonal superstructure, as is highlighted with a circle in Fig. 1b. This or- dered superstructure was not seen in our previous work on a- Fe2O3, and is thus presumed to be caused by the additional anneal- ing step.
A more noticeable change was observed by STM after the a- Fe2O3 structures were annealed at 750 K for 30 min (Fig. 1c). Spe- cifically, most of the oxide structures adopt an irregular hexagonal shape (six unequal length sides) with some structures taking on a more complex shape. The structures in Fig. 1c have a very broad size distribution, varying from a few nanometers to tens of nano- meters, but all have sharp and straight edges. The structures in Fig. 1c also display the ordered hexagonal superstructure noted in Fig. 1b.
The XP spectra indicate that the a-Fe2O3 structures grown on Au(1 1 1) are partially reduced after annealing at 750 K for 30 min. Specifically, the Fe 2p3/2 peak is broader in comparison to that of a-Fe2O3 (Fig. 2b), mainly due to the increasing intensity in the lower BE region (709 eV). In addition, the satellite peak of Fe3+ at 719 eV also becomes less visible. As suggested in the liter- ature [1,12], these results would indicate, although qualitatively,that a lower oxidation state of Fe2+ is produced in the particles dur- ing the annealing steps. This interpretation is also consistent with the slightly lowered intensity observed for the O 1s peak (Fig. 2b).
It should be noted that the BE of the O 1s peak also shifts +0.4 to
530.1 eV, in comparison to the data collected on a-Fe2O3.
The XPS data shows that the oxide continues to be reduced dur- ing longer annealing times at 750 K. After 60 min, the Fe 2p3/2 peak becomes much broader because of increasing intensities at both the lower and higher BE regions (Fig. 2c). The intensity changes at lower BE region (709 eV) are indicative of Fe2+; whereas the changes in the higher BE region (marked with a solid arrow in the Fe 2p region) are associated with a satellite excitation of the Fe2+ species [32]. Both sets of intensity changes are attributable to an increasing Fe2+ concentration. After 60 min of annealing,the satellite peak associated Fe3+ state (719 eV) becomes difficult to see, likely due to decreasing Fe3+ concentrations and the increas- ing intensity from the Fe2+ satellite excitation. The O 1s peak stays at 530.1 eV after 60 min of annealing, but its intensity continues to decrease. There is no further change observed after annealing at 750 K for 120 min (data not shown), meaning that the structures have reached a steady state at these conditions. The changes in the XP spectra that we attribute to the formation of Fe3O4 are more prominent at higher coverages and are illustrated and discussed below.
The XPS results for the reduction of a-Fe2O3 are quantified and summarized in Fig. 3. The atomic ratio of Fe to Au (also known as a monolayer equivalent (MLE) of Fe as defined in Section 2) remains constant, suggesting that there is no loss of Fe species during the annealing steps. Fig. 3 shows that the atomic ratio of O to Fe de- creases monotonically with annealing time, dropping from 1.5 (the stoichiometric value of a-Fe2O3) to 1.4 (after 30 min anneal- ing). The atomic ratio of O to Fe reaches a ratio of 1.3 after 60 min of annealing and remains the same thereafter. 730 725 720 715 710 705 Binding Energy (eV) Fe2+ 534 532 530 528 526 Binding Energy (eV)

629 On the basis of the XPS data and literature results for single crystal studies [6,8,12], we propose that the a-Fe2O3 structures grown on Au(1 1 1) are transformed into Fe3O4 by annealing in
UHV
at
750 K.
Previous studies have reported that an Fe3O4(1 1 1) overlayer can be formed on single crystal a-Fe2O3- (0 0 0 1) after annealing in UHV or in low partial pressures of O2 [6,8,12]. In those works, the epitaxial growth of one Fe-oxide phase on another is facilitated by the crystallographic similarity between Fe3O4 and a-Fe2O3; namely the closed-packed oxygen layers lying parallel to a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) are crystallographically similar to the closed-packed oxygen layers parallel to Fe3O4(1 1 1), as illustrated in the literature [8]. The a-Fe2O3 structures in our work consist of only two or three layers of (0 0 0 1) O-planes with a total height of 5 Å [24]. The reduced thickness of these structures suggests that the more complete transformation of the a-Fe2O3 structures into Fe3O4 could be expected versus a condition of one Fe-oxide phase growing epitaxially on top of another. Our XPS results (Figs. 2 and 3) are all consistent with the interpretation that the reduc- tion to Fe3O4 could be complete under our experimental conditions.The STM images of 1 MLE Fe3O4 on Au(1 1 1) (prepared from the annealing of 1 MLE a-Fe2O3 at 750 K for 120 min) are displayed in Fig. 4. Most of the Fe3O4 structures adopt an irregular hexagonal shape with sizes varying from a few nanometers to tens of nano- meters (Fig. 4a). The large Fe3O4 structures usually appear with or- dered hexagonal superstructures on the surface. After careful examination of the STM data, these Fe3O4 structures have two,slightly different, heights, which are shown by the examples marked as structures 1 and 2 in Fig. 4a. Structure 1 (apparent height 6 Å) seems to be representative of a majority of the fea- tures in Fig. 4a, and is about 1 Å lower than structure 2 (apparent height 7 Å), as demonstrated by linescans (Fig. 4b).

The enlarged images of structures 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. Both structures adopt an irregular hexagonal shape with a size of 20 nm. They both present an ordered hexag- onal superstructure (marked with a blue and a red unit cell on each structure, respectively), each with different periodicities. Structure 1 (shorter feature) has a larger periodicity (50 Å) while structure 2 (higher feature) has a smaller periodicity (42 Å).
Despite the differences mentioned above, both structures 1 and 2 have a similar atomic structure, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. Both structures show a hexagonal unit cell with a periodicity of 3 Å in the atomically resolved STM images. Some defects may also be present on both surfaces, appearing as deep depressions in the STM images (marked with arrows in Fig. 4e and f). The ordered superstructures for both classes of particles are still clearly visible,as highlighted by the dashed triangles in these atomically resolved images.
In addition to data at 1 MLE, we have also investigated higher coverages. At the coverage of 2 MLE, XPS results confirm that the annealing step also leads to the reduction of a-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, sig- nified by the broadening of the Fe 2p3/2 peak and the diminishing of the Fe3+ satellite peak (Fig. 5a). The higher coverage used in Fig. 5a makes the XPS changes described with the reduction of a- Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 in Fig 2a far more pronounced. In particular, the loss of the Fe3+ satellite and the broadening of the Fe 2p3/2 peak are more discernable. STM images of a coverage of 2 MLE shows that Fe3O4 forms continuous films with visible boundaries (Fig. 5b).
There are also small regions of the surface which are missing Fe3O4 and the Au(1 1 1) growth substrate is visible. The 2 MLE film shows an ordered hexagonal superstructure with a periodicity of 50 Å (Fig. 5c), the same as was observed for structure 1 in Fig. 4c. Structure 2 from Fig. 4 with a periodicity of 42 Å was not observed at this coverage even after checking several different spots on the Au(1 1 1) crystal. However, the presence of structure 2 at this coverage cannot be completely ruled out because of the localized nature of STM imaging. The atomically resolved images from the 2 MLE film also show a hexagonal lattice with a periodic- ity of 3 Å (Fig. 5d).
Fe3O4 has an inverse spinel structure with cubic closed-packed O anions forming planes perpendicular to the (1 1 1) direction [4].
The average OO spacing within the (1 1 1) planes is 2.97 Å. The Fe cations are located in the interstitial sites distributed as eight Fe2+ and eight Fe3+ ions in octahedral holes of the O sublattice, and eight Fe3+ ions in tetrahedral holes within a unit cell. There are two pos- sible Fe-terminations, noted as Kagom and mix-trigonal layers,respectively [1], and both terminations have an identical inter- atomic FeFe distance of 5.94 Å. The measured hexagonal lattice with a periodicity of 3 Å suggests that the oxygen atoms in Fe3O4(1 1 1) were imaged under the tunneling conditions used in our STM study. We caution against concluding that these Fe3O4 materials have an O-terminated surface based solely on the oxygen lattice imaged in our STM results since tunneling conditions and tip interactions can cause imaging of sub-surface states as has been seen previously for STM studies of Fe2O3 films and surfaces. More detailed computational studies and experiments such as dynamical LEED analysis and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) measurements similar to those conducted for the Fe2O3 system [1,9] will be needed to conclusively determine the surface termination of the Fe3O4 materials studied here.
Studies from both single crystal Fe3O4(1 1 1) and the nominally Fe3O4(1 1 1) terminated a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) system have determined the surface to be an Fe-termination, and a hexagonal unit cell of 6 Å (corresponding to the Fe atom periodicity) has been observed in the atomically resolved STM images [6,33]. If the Fe3O4(1 1 1) structures prepared in our work were indeed terminated by Fe,the differences of the atomic images between our work and those single crystal works could come from the different tunneling Fig. 5.

631 conditions used in each study, resulting in imaging of different states. Likewise, it could be attributed to the reduced dimension of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films supported on the Au(1 1 1) substrate, resulting in modified electronic states compared to the bulk materials.
Note that two types of hexagonal superstructures with distinct periodicities (50 and 42 Å, respectively) have been identified in the study. The hexagonal superstructure with a 42 Å periodicity seems to match the dimensions of the so-called biphase structure observed on sputtered and annealed a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) in the litera- tures [1,34]. It was recently suggested to result from as a simple hex-on-hex overlayer: a thin Fe3O4-type layer at or near the a- Fe2O3 surface [12]. There are no reports in the literature of observing the hexagonal superstructure of 50 Å which indeed is a significant feature of this work. More studies, including the theoretical efforts,will be needed to the sort out the origins of this superstructure.
4. Conclusion
Fe3O4 has been formed on Au(1 1 1) by annealing a- Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures in UHV at 750 K. The reduction to Fe3O4 has been proposed in comparison with the literature results and been supported by XPS, showing a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak due to the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased atomic ratio of O and Fe (from 1.5 to 1.3). STM characterization of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and films shows that Fe3O4 appears as particles on Au(1 1 1) at the coverages below 1 MLE, adopting an irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges. At coverages of 2 MLE, most of the Au(1 1 1) has been covered with a Fe3O4 thin film.
While two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å have been observed on large Fe3O4 particles, the 50 Å periodicity is the dominant superstructure observed on the continuous Fe3O4 thin films. A hexagonal lattice with a periodicity of 3 Å has been observed in the atomically resolved STM images at all coverages of Fe3O4, suggesting that the oxygen atoms in Fe3O4(1 1 1) are being imaged.
