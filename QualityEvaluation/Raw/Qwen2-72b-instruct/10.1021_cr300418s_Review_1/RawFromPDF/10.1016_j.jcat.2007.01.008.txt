Abstract
Aiming at an estimate of the number of chemically active surface defects on MgO nanocrystals, we used Li+ doping in conjunction with
subsequent thermal annealing. Changes in the surface reactivity of the Li+-doped nanocrystals were monitored by IR and electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy using chemisorbed hydrogen, surface trapped electrons, and surface complexed O−
2 as molecular probes. It was found
that the admixture of 0.2 at% Li+ not only signiﬁcantly reduces the thermal stability, but also changes all surface spectroscopic features speciﬁc to
pure MgO. On the basis of the Li+ doping effect, the maximum concentration of active surface sites on undoped MgO nanocrystals corresponds
to 3% of a nanocrystal monolayer.

1. Introduction
Insights into electronic structure and chemical surface reac-
tivity of polycrystalline materials are important for heteroge-
neous catalysis, engineering of nanomaterials, and the deﬁni-
tion of new device concepts on the nanoscale. We have shown
in previous work that MgO nanoparticles can be produced by
chemical vapor deposition and that the choice of the produc-
tion parameters sets the average size of the particles [1]. MgO
nanoparticles appear to be outstanding building blocks for the
construction of functional nanostructures and mesostructures
and to serve as suitable model systems for the investigation of
surface reactivity on oxides. Pure alkaline earth oxides (AEOs)
have been intensively investigated in the ﬁelds of surface sci-
ence and catalysis [2–11] due to their simple crystal structure
and perfect ionicity. Furthermore, the MgO surface can be ef-
fectively doped with selected impurities by making use of ther-
mally induced impurity segregation into the surface [12,13]. As

demonstrated for mixed CaxMg1−xO particles, this can lead to
unexpected optical and chemical surface properties [14,15].
The motivation for the present investigation has been to elu-
cidate how traces of Li impurities affect the surface proper-
ties of the MgO nanoparticles. The close ionic radius of Li+
(rLi+ = 0.76 Å) compared with that of Mg2+ (rMg2+ = 0.72 Å)
allows for easy substitutional accommodation within the MgO
lattice. After thermal treatment, Li+ ions tend to localize in
the surface and near-surface region of the MgO-based crys-
tallites [16]. They induce defects that are important for het-
erogeneous catalysis, where Li-promoted MgO is discussed
as a nonredox catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion reactions
[17–22]. Li+O−sites are proposed to abstract atomic hydrogen
from the hydrocarbon-generating radicals, which then desorb to
start a chain propagation reaction in the gas phase. The catalytic
activity of the solid exhibits a strong correlation to the amount
of removable oxygen that is apparently destabilized by Li+ ions
[21,23].
Along with the generation of [Li+O−] centers, an alterna-
tive mechanism that involves surface F-centers as active sites
has been put forward [24,25]. A direct theoretical comparison
of the associated energetics was made recently using electronic
structure techniques based on DFT calculations. This provided

relevant clues that binding of a hydrogen atom (originating
from, e.g., hydrogen abstraction from CH4) to an O−ion is en-
ergetically more favorable than binding to an F-center [26].
Thermal treatment affects the material properties of Li-
doped MgO polycrystals in the following ways:
(i) At elevated temperatures, the loss of structural oxygen of
Li-doped MgO is facilitated. The concomitant increase in
the oxygen vacancy concentration gives rise to p-type con-
ductivity [27,28], which is enhanced compared with pure
MgO above 873 K and prevails as a conduction mecha-
nism at 1170 K. The electronic properties of a solid are
related to the catalytic performance of doped oxide ma-
terials, because molecule activation generally occurs via
charge transfer between the catalyst surface and the adsor-
bate.
(ii) Li+ ions affect particle morphology. The dominant mech-
anism of Li incorporation involves the generation of
hole centers, which—after segregation into the surface—
destabilize low-index planes at higher coverages. Octa-
hedrally shaped MgO-based crystals expressed by (111)
planes are expected on the basis of theoretical investi-
gations [29]. In fact, Hargreaves et al. [30] reported that
Li-induced sintering of the crystallites is accompanied by
loss of the regular morphology of the MgO precursor.
(iii) The thermal stability of the doped polycrystals is sig-
niﬁcantly decreased compared with undoped MgO. This
presents a practical limitation, because the increase in
grain size is equivalent to the decrease in chemically ac-
tive surface area. XRD measurements have revealed the
absence of any phase impurity, such as Li2O, Li2CO3, or
LiOH in Li+-doped MgO particles, containing <10 at%
Li+ [16].
The description of reactive surface sites by spectroscopy at
room temperature and below represents a useful approach for
the characterization of relevant adsorption sites on the catalyst
surface [31], although the corresponding experiments must be
carried out under conditions much different than those during a
catalytic reaction cycle.
Doping polycrystalline materials with impurities—which
has a profound effect on the surface reactivity of the host oxide
but do not alter the bulk structure—can represent an approach to
quantifying the number of reactive sites on pure MgO particles.
We produced Li+-doped MgO nanoparticles using the chem-
ical vapor deposition (CVD) technique and characterized Li+
ion-induced changes on the surface of the resulting nanopar-
ticles. IR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) identiﬁed three characteristic types of surface defects:
sites that dissociatively activate molecular hydrogen [32–34],
oxygen-anion deﬁcient arrays acting as electron traps [35–37],
and surface cations complexing superoxy species O−
2 [38,39].
On the basis of Li+-induced surface changes related to the
total Li+ content, an estimate for the number of chemically rele-
vant surface sites on doped and undoped nanoparticles is given.
2. Experimental
MgO and Li-doped MgO nanoparticles were prepared
by CVD based on the reaction of metal vapor (Mg: John-
son Matthey, 99.98%; Li: Aldrich, 99.9%) with O2 (Messer
Griessheim, 99.998%). The ﬂow reactor system comprises a
quartz glass tube and an inner stainless steel tube mounted con-
centrically inside a cylindrical furnace. Ar gas ﬂows through the
inner stainless steel tube and transports the metal atoms (mag-
nesium vaporized at 900 K and lithium vaporized at 760–860 K,
depending on the Li content required [40]) to a combustion
zone, in which the reaction with oxygen coming from the outer
quartz glass tube leads to the formation of nanometer-sized ox-
ide particles. These are then deposited at the downstream end
within a stainless steel net. Mg and Li concentrations were
determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer
2280) using hollow cathode lamps. The relative concentration
of Li and Mg was constant over a production period of 30 min.
Composition analysis of samples before and after annealing
under high-vacuum conditions revealed that about 50% of the
original Li content was lost during activation via evaporation.
The samples were also checked for Fe contamination, which
can originate from the stainless steel tube of the CVD reactor
system; Fe at concentrations above 10 ppm was excluded on
the basis of AAS measurements. For speciﬁc surface area de-
termination, BET adsorption isotherms were measured by N2
physisorption at 77 K.
The IR experiments were performed in an appropriate sam-
ple cell that allows sample activation at high-vacuum conditions
with a base pressure above 5×10−6 mbar. Samples, in the form
of hand-pressed, self-supporting wafers, were measured in the
IR transmission mode with a Bruker IFS 113v spectrometer.
A total of 300 scans were accumulated for one spectrum to ob-
tain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral resolution
was 3 cm−1. For IR and EPR spectroscopic measurements, the
respective material was subjected to thermal treatment up to
1173 K. First, the sample was heated at a rate of 5 K min−1 to
873 K and exposed to oxygen at this temperature to remove or-
ganic contaminants. Finally, the sample was heated to 1173 K
at p < 5 × 10−6 mbar and kept under these conditions for 1–
2 h to dehydroxylate the particle surfaces. Occasional impuri-
ties, such as carbonaceous species, were completely eliminated
by this procedure. In contrast to pure MgO, Li-doped samples
showed absorptions of minor intensity in the OH region with
band positions different than those observed on pure MgO after
chemisorption of H2. The spectra shown in Fig. 2 were obtained
by subtracting spectra measured in the presence of 100 mbar
from those acquired directly after thermal activation and cool-
ing to room temperature.
For EPR measurements, the respective powder sample was
ﬁlled into an EPR tube, which was then attached to a high-
vacuum pumping stage, providing a base pressure p < 5 ×
10−6 mbar. The same activation procedure as in the IR study
was applied. UV exposure for the generation of paramagnetic
surface defects was carried out using a 300-W xenon lamp
(Oriel) equipped with a water ﬁlter. X-band EPR measurements
were performed with a Bruker EMX 10/12 spectrometer us-

ing an ER 4102 ST standard rectangular resonant cavity in the
TE102 mode. Low-temperature measurements were done with a
Dewar ﬁlled with liquid nitrogen (T = 77 K). Ten accumulated
scans provided a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. The g val-
ues were determined on the basis of a DPPH standard (Aldrich
25,762-1).
3. Results
3.1. Thermal stability
Fig. 1 plots the speciﬁc surface area values of pure and
Li+-doped MgO nanoparticles as a function of thermal activa-
tion at temperatures between 473 and 1173 K. For pure MgO,
470 m2 g−1 was measured immediately after the CVD process
(Fig. 1a). On thermal activation, the speciﬁc surface area was

maintained up to 673 K. Between 673 K and 873 K, however,
the surface area decreased to 300 m2 g−1 and remained con-
stant thereafter at least up to 1173 K. After thermal activation,
the pure MgO nanocrystals had a particle size of 7 nm. For the
Li+-doped samples, the speciﬁc surface area was critically de-
pendent on the Li+ concentration and decreased with increasing
amounts of Li+ (Figs. 1b–1d). All of these curves had a decay
at 673–873 K in common.
3.2. IR spectroscopy: surface hydroxyl and hydride groups
The IR spectra in Fig. 2 demonstrate hydrogen chemisorp-
tion in the presence of 100 mbar H2 on undoped and doped
MgO nanoparticles that had been dehydroxylated at 1173 K.
For undoped MgO nanoparticles, it is generally accepted that at
room temperature, hydrogen splitting proceeds via two differ-
ent heterolytic pathways according to [32,33,36]
Mg2+–O2−+ H2 →Mg2+H−–O2−H+.
(1)
The corresponding IR spectrum (Fig. 2, bottom) clearly reveals
two pairs of OH and MgH stretching bands, which are asso-
ciated with irreversible (3712 and 1130 cm−1) and a reversible
H2-splitting processes (3462 and 1325 cm−1) [32,33]. Profound
spectral changes occurred with increasing Li+ concentration
(Fig. 2). The OH and MgH stretching bands speciﬁc to pure
MgO lost intensity, and new bands grew in the OH and MeH
stretching region. At a concentration of 0.2 at% (Fig. 3, top) the
MgO-speciﬁc OH and MgH bands were lost. Obviously, a Li
concentration of 0.2 at% Li (bulk plus surface) effectively re-
placed all MgO-speciﬁc IR bands after thermally induced Li+
segregation.

the sample spectra before admission of 100 mbar H2 from those recorded thereafter. The spectra of Li-doped samples were not normalized with respect to comparable
surface areas.

pure (a) and Li-doped MgO nanoparticles (b–d). The paramagnetic centers were
generated by UV exposure in the presence of 10 mbar H2 at room temperature.
3.3. EPR spectroscopy: surface-trapped electrons
After thermal activation at 1170 K and cooling, Li+-doped
MgO nanoparticles showed no paramagnetic center at 77 K.
To generate trapped electron centers as paramagnetic surface
probes, samples of various Li+ contents were exposed to hy-
drogen and UV light. On pure high-surface area MgO, such a
treatment led to the production of (H+)(e−) centers that are in-
tensively investigated surface probes [37,41,42]. The character-
istic EPR signature revealed signiﬁcant electron spin interaction
with the proton of an adjacent OH group appearing as a super-
hyperﬁne splitting of the resonance lines into a doublet [41,43].
Fig. 3a shows a typical color center signal measured on MgO
nanocubes [35,44]. The admixture of Li+ doping gradually re-
placed the characteristic signature with a broad isotropic signal
(Figs. 3b–3b) that does not change its contour within the mi-
crowave power range of 10−6–10−3 W. At a Li+ concentration
of 0.3 at%, the MgO-speciﬁc color center signature was essen-
tially lost.
3.4. EPR spectroscopy: adsorbed O−
2 ions stabilized by
surface cations

trapped electrons destroys the corresponding signals in Fig. 2

(2)
This also applies for Li+-doped MgO nanoparticles, as demon-
strated by the EPR spectra in Fig. 4, in which orthorhombic
signal patterns of the radical anions are clearly observable.
The gxx and gyy signals overlap, but the well-separated gzz
components, which are subject to the local crystal ﬁeld gra-
dient at the adsorption site, present a site-sensitive probe for
surface cations [38]. On undoped MgO, essentially two O−
2
species complexed by differently coordinated surface Mg2+
cations can be identiﬁed from the EPR spectrum in Fig. 4a.
All components of the g tensor, including gzz at 2.077 and
at 2.090, exhibit a distinct hyperﬁne interaction with the pro-
ton of a nearby hydroxyl group (1H shf splitting), consistent
with previous observations given in Table 1 [45,46]. A third
O−
2 type characterized with gzz = 2.080 can be found on sam-
ples with 0.11 and 0.30 at% Li+ (Fig. 4). The g-matrix of
this signal lacks 1H shf splitting effects and indicates the ab-
sence of a signiﬁcant interaction between the adsorbed oxygen
radical and a hydroxyl group in close vicinity. The fact that
such species have also been observed in previous experiments
on pure MgO [46] suggests that it is not directly associated
with Li+ cations as coordinating surface sites. With increasing
Li+ content, all MgO-speciﬁc O−
2 sites lost relative intensity
(Figs. 4b–4c), and above 0.2 at% Li+ the most intense MgO
component at gzz = 2.077 is absent. Furthermore, the 1H shf
splitting effect cannot be resolved at higher Li+ concentrations.

A broad and intense feature at g = 2.052 appears (Fig. 4c).
Comparison with literature values reveals that the g parame-
ters g⊥= 2.054 and g∥= 2.004 (Table 1) are consistent with
O−hole centers in conjunction with adjacent Li+ ions [47,48]
rather than with the EPR signature of O−
2 ions [38,39]. As re-
ported by Lunsford et al. [48], on powders, such centers are
generated at temperatures above 673 K and stabilized there-
after if quenching in liquid O2 to 77 K is applied. In the present
study, adding H2 to a sample (characterized by the top spec-
trum in Fig. 4) led to only a partial signal reduction ( < 10%)
of the feature at g = 2.054 and thus indicates reduced chemi-
cal reactivity compared with hole centers present on pure MgO
nanocubes [44].
4. Discussion
Traces of Li ions signiﬁcantly affected the thermal stability
of the MgO-based materials. Already during particle genera-
tion in the combustion ﬂame inside the CVD reactor, signiﬁcant
grain coarsening occurred, as derived from the initial values of
the BET measurements (Fig. 1). After subsequent thermal acti-
vation under high-vacuum conditions, a Li+ concentration de-
crease of about 50% was observed. This is in line with other re-
ports of Li2O evaporation during sintering of Li+-doped MgO
materials [49]. By favoring the formation of anion vacancies,
Li+ ions enhance ion mobility at elevated temperatures [27,28]
and segregate from the bulk into the nanoparticle surface. In
fact, quantum chemical calculations have suggested that Li+
cations embedded in the MgO nanoparticles segregate during
an appropriate annealing procedure into the surface, where they
preferentially substitute the lowest-coordinated Mg2+ cations
to compensate for local deviations from stoichiometry [50,51].
The IR and EPR spectroscopic data obtained for Li+-doped
MgO nanoparticles (Figs. 2 and 4) have one feature in com-
mon: After thermal treatment, Li+ ions localize either in the
near-surface region or in the surface of the MgO-based mater-
ial, where they signiﬁcantly alter surface reactivity. Irrespective
of the speciﬁc surface reaction, hydrogen activation (Fig. 2),
electron trapping (Fig. 3), or electron transfer to molecular oxy-
gen (Fig. 4), Li+ admixture with a concentration of ca. 0.2 at%
replaces all MgO-speciﬁc signals by qualitatively new spectro-
scopic features. It was shown that undoped high-surface area
MgO materials (compare, e.g., CVD MgO nanocubes [18,33,
35] with MgO obtained via the controlled thermal decomposi-
tion of hydroxides [5,32,37]) have different particle morpholo-
gies but show identical spectroscopic ﬁngerprints in terms of IR
band positions [32,33] and g factors [35,37]. This rules out the
possibility that MgO particle morphology variations give rise to
different spectroscopic features and furthermore proves that the
spectroscopic effects observed for Li-containing samples are di-
rectly related to the presence of Li ions.
Obviously there is no preferential depletion of either elec-
tron-trapping sites or sites active in hydrogen splitting with
increased Li+ concentration. This may be explained in two
different ways: either Li+ inﬂuences the respective underly-
ing sites accidentally to the same extent, or the sites involved
in hydrogen chemisorption and electron-trapping are identical.
The substitution of Mg2+ cations by Li+ ions can also lead to
long-range effects regarding the reactivity of local MgO-based
surface structures, such as inverse steps proposed for H2 split-
ting [32] or edges as electron-trapping sites [37].
Surface-trapped electrons react instantaneously with O2. It
was shown by OH probe spectroscopy that O−
2 sites character-
ized by a gzz component at 2.077 are directly associated with
the trapping site that previously hosted the (H+)(e−) center
[33,34,45]. Structural elements, such as edges and step edges
made of four-coordinated cations and anions, can be active for
electron trapping and the complexation of O−
2 ions, as demon-
strated by the good agreement between experimental and theo-
retical data [36,37,52,53]. The relative contribution of the O−
2
at gzz = 2.077 decreased with increasing Li+ content compared
with the less strongly bound O−
2 with gzz at 2.090. This again is
in line with quantum mechanical calculations predicting that the
lowest-coordinated Mg2+ cations are replaced by thermally in-
duced Li+ segregation [50]. Regarding the O−
2 , which is associ-
ated with a signiﬁcantly smaller local crystal ﬁeld splitting with
gzz = 2.090, there is agreement that the complexing cation must
be ﬁvefold located in a (100) microplane [54,55]. The electronic
interaction between the O−
2 ion and a nearby OH group would
explain the stability of this adsorption complex [56].
As a surprising result, an EPR signal at g = 2.052 emerged
after color centers were bleached on thermally stable MgO
nanoparticles at Li+ concentrations >0.2 at% (Fig. 4d). This
feature was observed on pure Li2O powders and assigned to
a stable surface O−species. It is likely to be present on Li+-
doped MgO nanoparticles. Owing to the comparatively large
half width of this signal component, it is detectable only at
higher concentrations. With the less tightly bound electrons of
the oxygen anions surrounding the low-coordinated Li+, the
electron afﬁnity of the O2 molecules might facilitate electron
transfer from O2−to O2.
The surface concentration of defects on pure MgO nanopar-
ticles can be estimated by evaluating the Li+ concentration
effect on the MgO-speciﬁc reactivity pattern. The following as-
sumptions can be made:
(i) The total amount of Li+ segregates into the subsurface or
surface region. Correspondingly, the estimated concentra-
66

tion presents an upper limit, because Li+ ions that remain
dissolved in the bulk cannot be excluded.
(ii) The particle surface is assumed to be smooth in the sense
that the speciﬁc surface area can be directly related to the
particle size on the basis of particle shape. This assumption
is valid for pure MgO nanocubes in which the average edge
length of the cube is consistent with the measured values
for the speciﬁc surface area [1].
With respect to various methods of determining average par-
ticles size, D (i.e., TEM, X-ray diffraction, and BET), the
use of BET speciﬁc surface areas (SBET)—where the cross-
sectional area of N2 (in nm2 molecule−1) serves as principle
input parameter—provides the most straightforward approach.
The respective formula SBET = 6(1/ρ · DBET), with ρ as the
density of the solid, applies for cubes as well as for spheres and
thus for all conceivable MgO particle morphologies. In case of
rougher particle surfaces, the derived value for D may deviate
from the true value but will not affect the ﬁnal result, that is, the
maximum concentration of reactive surface sites.
A speciﬁc surface area of 110 m2 g−1 for MgO particles
doped with 0.2 at% Li (Fig. 1) corresponds to an average
edge length of 15.2 nm for cubical-shaped particles. Such a
particle contains 3.8 × 105 ions in total and 760 Li+ ions if
doped with 0.2 at% Li+. With a total number of 1.5 × 104
surface cations and perfect Li+ segregation into the surface
[assumption (i)], 4.8% of all surface cations would be Li+.
This number also applies for spherical particles with a diam-
eter of 15.1 nm [57]. If we exclude long-range effects, where
a Li+ ion affects the reactivity of more than one coordination
sphere, this suggests that <3% of all cationic surface sites are
involved in surface processes, such as hydrogen chemisorption
and electron-trapping. This estimate corresponds to an upper
limit, because complete segregation of Li+ from the bulk into
the surface and atomically plane surfaces were adopted in the
model applied. The underestimation of smaller particle sizes
(an inherent shortcoming of the BET approach) implies that the
actual surface site concentration is again <3%. It is interesting
to note that on an ideal MgO cube of 15.2 nm edge length, this
value corresponds to the fraction of surface cations located on
the edges.
5. Conclusion
Admixtures of small amounts of Li to Mg vapor during the
chemical vapor deposition process decrease the stability of the
resulting oxide nanoparticles. After thermally induced surface
segregation, Li+ ions effectively alter all MgO-speciﬁc spectro-
scopic ﬁngerprints, such as IR active hydroxyls and hydrides,
surface-trapped electrons, and adsorbed oxygen radicals. We
conclude that Li+ ions preferentially move into surface sites
associated with low-coordinated ions and enhanced surface re-
activity. Doping of oxide nanostructures with chemically ac-
tive impurities provides an efﬁcient way to estimate the con-
centration of reactive surface defects on the undoped mater-
ial.
