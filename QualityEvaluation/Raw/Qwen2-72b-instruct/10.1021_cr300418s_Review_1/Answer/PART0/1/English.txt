Impurities in oxide catalysts, which may act as substitutional dopants, can segregate at the surface and influence catalytic activity without our knowledge, even at low concentrations. Additives in industrial catalysts, designed to prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent catalyst evaporation, increase conversion, selectivity, or poison unwanted reactions, might have unintentionally led to the use of doped oxide catalysts throughout history. This historical perspective suggests that the use of doped oxides in catalysis could be as old as the use of oxides themselves, highlighting the potential for unrecognized contributions of dopants to catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design.
