The historical evolution and unintended application of doped oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation processes have been significantly influenced by the presence of impurities and additives, as elucidated in reference \[10.1021/cr300418s_1\]. These impurities, acting as substitutional dopants, can segregate at the surface of oxide catalysts and impact catalytic activity, even at low concentrations, without our conscious recognition. Industrial catalysts, enriched with additives aimed at preventing coarsening, ensuring mechanical stability, inhibiting catalyst evaporation, enhancing conversion, selectivity, or selectively poisoning unwanted reactions, have inadvertently led to the utilization of doped oxide catalysts throughout history. This historical perspective suggests that the use of doped oxides in catalysis could be as ancient as the use of oxides themselves, underscoring the potential for unrecognized contributions of dopants to catalytic processes and the evolution of modern catalyst design.
