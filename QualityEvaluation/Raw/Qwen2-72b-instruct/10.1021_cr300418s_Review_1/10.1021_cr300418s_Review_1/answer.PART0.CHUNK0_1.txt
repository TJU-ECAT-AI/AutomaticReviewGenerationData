[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."

1.Impurities in oxide catalysts, which may act as substitutional dopants, can segregate at the surface and influence catalytic activity without being recognized, due to their low concentration. Additives in industrial catalysts, designed to improve various properties, might also contribute to catalytic activity unintentionally. This historical perspective suggests that the use of doped oxide catalysts could be as old as the use of oxide catalysts itself, indicating that the effects of doping on catalysis might have been present but unrecognized in the early stages of catalysis research.

1.氧化物催化剂中的杂质可能作为替代掺杂剂，它们在表面的分离可以影响催化活性，而我们可能并未意识到这一点，因为它们的总浓度很低。工业催化剂中的添加剂，旨在改善各种性能，也可能无意中对催化活性产生贡献。这一历史视角表明，掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用可能与氧化物催化剂的使用一样古老，这意味着掺杂对催化作用的影响可能从催化研究的早期阶段就存在，但未被认识到。
