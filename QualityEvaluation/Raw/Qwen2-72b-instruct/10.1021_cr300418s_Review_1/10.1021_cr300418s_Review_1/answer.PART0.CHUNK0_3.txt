[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."

1.Impurities in oxide catalysts, which may act as substitutional dopants, can segregate at the surface and influence catalytic activity without our knowledge, even at low concentrations. Industrial catalysts often contain additives that serve various functions, such as preventing coarsening, ensuring mechanical stability, and increasing selectivity. These unintentional dopants and additives suggest that catalysis by doped oxides may have a history as long as that of oxide catalysis itself, implying that our current understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design might have evolved from these historical practices without explicit recognition.

1.氧化物催化剂中的杂质可能作为替代掺杂剂，在表面分离，即使浓度很低，也可能在我们不知情的情况下影响催化活性。工业催化剂通常含有少量添加剂，用于防止粗化、确保机械稳定性、提高选择性等。这些无意中的掺杂剂和添加剂表明，掺杂氧化物的催化作用可能与氧化物催化作用的历史一样长，这意味着我们对催化过程的当前理解以及现代催化剂设计的发展可能源于这些历史实践，而没有明确的认识。
