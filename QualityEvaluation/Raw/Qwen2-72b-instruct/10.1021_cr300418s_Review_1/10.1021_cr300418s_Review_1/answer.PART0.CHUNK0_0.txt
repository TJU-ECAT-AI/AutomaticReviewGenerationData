[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."

1.Impurities in oxide catalysts, which may act as substitutional dopants, can segregate at the surface and influence catalytic activity without our knowledge, even at low concentrations. Additives in industrial catalysts, designed to prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent catalyst evaporation, increase conversion, selectivity, or poison unwanted reactions, might have unintentionally led to the use of doped oxide catalysts throughout history. This historical perspective suggests that the use of doped oxides in catalysis could be as old as the use of oxides themselves, implying that the development of modern catalyst design might have been influenced by these unintentional practices.

1.氧化物催化剂中的杂质可能作为替代掺杂剂，即使浓度很低，如果它们在表面分离，也可能在我们不知情的情况下影响催化活性。工业催化剂中的添加剂，旨在防止粗化，提供机械稳定性，防止催化剂蒸发，增加转化率，选择性，或毒害不需要的反应，可能无意中导致了历史上掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用。这一历史视角表明，掺杂氧化物在催化中的使用可能与氧化物本身的使用一样古老，这意味着现代催化剂设计的发展可能受到了这些无意行为的影响。
