The Catalytic Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide on Nickel Oxide. I. Pure Nickel Oxide
BY G. PARRAVANO
RECEIVED
JUNE 20, 1952
The reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen was investigated on nickel oxide catalysts at different partial pressures of carbon monoxide and oxygen and temperatures up to 222'.After an initial stage characterized by high rates and rapidly diminishing activity, the catalyst shows a minimum constant value of activity. The kinetics of this latter stage changes above 180". A reaction mechanism to explain the experimental data i s derived. The concentration of excess oxygen in the solid phase is shown to be the controlling factor in determining the type of kinetics followed by the reaction.
Several metal oxides are known to contain oxygen in excess d the stoichiometric amount. The excess oxygen, which is often referred to as active oxygen,affects a large number of physico-chemical proper- ties of these oxides.' The role played by active oxygen in oxidation catalysis has been recently studied by Krauss,2 who was able to show that the formation of nitrous oxide from ammonia-oxygen mixtures is directly dependent on the oxygen con- tent of the solid phase and independent of the type of oxide catalyst used. On the basis of these and previous results on a variety of oxidation processes it can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate re- duction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the ex- cess oxygen present on the surface, whose steady state concentration during catalysis is dependent on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase. It is therefore of interest in catalytic stud- ies of oxidation reactions to investigate how the ex- cess oxygen of the solid phase affects the over-all catalytic process. The present investigation rep- resents an attempt to apply these considerations in deriving the kinetics of the oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide.Previously, Bone and Andrew,studying the same reaction on nickel oxide powder, found that the process could be described by a first order equation with respect to the total pressure. They concluded that the reaction occurs through the formation on the nickel oxide surface of a film of active oxygen,which in turn oxidizes adsorbed carbon monoxide.The same reaction was recently studied by Rogin- skii and Tselinskaya4 on nickel oxide obtained from nickel carbonate. These authors were able to cor- relate the activity of the catalyst with the change in free energy occurring during the decomposition process of nickel carbonate.Experimental Materials.-Nickel oxide samples were prepared in the following ways.
C.P. nickel nitrate was decomposed for 3
hours at 300, fired in air at 640' for an additional 3 hours,then slowly cooled to room temperature. The resulting gray-green oxide was found to liberate iodine from an acid (1) M. Le Blanc and E. Mobius, 2. physik. Chem., A142, 59 (1934);

According to Prasad and TendulkaId this prepara- tion of nickel oxide contains a large excess of oxygen. A second sample of nickel oxide was obtained under similar conditions except that decomposition and firing of the nickel nitrate was accomplished in an atmosphere of purified he- lium. Carbon monoxide, from a commercial tank, was purified by passing it through glass wool, soda lime and phosphorus pentoxide. This method of purification was found to give a gas sufficiently free of catalytic poisons,since, in preliminary tests, no difference in catalytic activity could be found using a gas purified with the above method or by low temperature distillation. Oxygen from a com- mercial tank was purified by passing it over calcium chlo- ride, Pd-asbestos and phosphorus pentoxide.
Apparatus.-Rates of oxidation were observed in an all- glass, completely closed system, having a total volume of 302 cc. Weighed amounts of catalyst (0.05 + 0.4 g., 20-30 mesh) were loaded in a small reactor, surrounded by an electrically heated coil. Reactor temperature was con- trolled (k0.5') by a gas thermoregulator.Premixed carbon monoxide and oxygen were forced to pass through the cata- lyst by means of an alternating mercury pump, driven by an electrical motor. Gold foils were placed in the apparatus to trap any mercury vapor which might pass in. The car- bon dioxide formed could be removed by passing the gases through a column filled with Ascarite.Changes in pressure due to the reaction were recorded by means of a mercury manometer.The manometer readings, taken with the aid of a cathetometer, provided a means of following the extent of the reaction.In order to obtain data, independent o f
diffusion effects, several pumping speeds were tried, and a pumping speed of 10 cc. sec.-l was finally adopted. Gener- ally runs were carried to - 30% conversion. Some runs however were carried to completion, and in cases where the initial ratio of CO: 0 2 was different from the stoichiometric the final pressure agreed quite well with the pressure calcu- lated from the initial pressure. The experimental error in the determination of the velocity constant, k,was 5 9%,and of the over-all activation energy, E, 5 1 kcal./mole.
Results From the beginnink of this study, it became clear that the catalyst was undergoing an irreversible change during the course of each run. However,after being used for a sufficient time, the activity of the catalyst reached a minimum value, which could be considered constant for all practical pur- poses. It was therefore concluded that, under the conditions of the experiment, two different stages for the catalytic process have to be recognized: (a) an initial stage characterized by high rates and rapidly diminishing activity, followed by stage (b) of constant activity. Both stages are kinetically distinguishable.
Data for stage (a) were found to obey a kinetic law o f the type where g is the amount o f conversion and a, C

Discussion From the data presented it is clear that the oxida- tion process involves at least two kinetically differ- ent stages. Stage (a), represented by equation (1) can be suppressed by pretreating the catalyst with carbon monoxide but not with oxygen. This fact may be taken as an indication that the initial step consists in the removal by carbon monoxide o f a large excess of surface oxygen, which is built into the catalyst during its preparation. I t  must be pointed out that the detrimental effect of carbon monoxide on the activity of the catalyst occurs in a temperature range where no lattice oxygen is read- ily removed. A similar effect, obtained by pre- treatment of the catalyst with carbon monoxide, has already been described by Burns6 for the oxidation o f carbon monoxide on manganese dioxide.

lower rate of oxidation is found on nickel oxide,which was fired in helium, as compared to samples fired in air. Since the former contains undoubtedly less excess oxygen than the latter, this fact is pre- sented as supporting evidence for the previous ex- planation of the initial step o f the oxidation proc- ess. The present results.on the initial rates of oxida- tion agree with those o f Roginskii and Tselin- k a y a ,who found that carbon monoxide oxidation on very active nickel oxide catalysts could be ki- netically described by equation (l),while for less active catalysts the data could be fitted to a first order equation. Equation (1) has already been used to express the kinetics of a number o f hetero- geneous processes. Roginskii and eo-workers' were able to describe the adsorption of carbon monoxide and its oxidation on manganese dioxide in terms of equation (1). Elovich and Zhabrova* found that ethylene hydrogenation on nickel together with the activated adsorption o f ethylene and hydrogen on the same catalyst followed the same exponential law. More recently the derivation and interpre- tation of equation (1) have been discussed by Tay- lor and T h  n ,who showed that a large number of (2) (3) (6) N. Shurmovskaya and B. Burns, J. Phys.

In the course o f the initial step of the oxidation of carbon monoxide a strong interaction occurs between reactants and catalyst, some o f the surface oxygen being irreversibly removed by car- bon monoxide. I f the over-all oxidation process is represented by the steps (S)O + co = (S) + cor! (

pres- ent. Supporting evidence for this fact can be ob- tained by considering the effect of the pretreatment,as previously discussed, o f the catalyst with carbon monoxide. As the concentration of (S)O adjusts to that corresponding to the gas phase pressure of oxygen, the catalyst reaches a constant activity,characterized by the kinetics o f stage (b). Then, if reaction (4) is slow compared with (5),the rate of (4) is given by vi = kPcoecs)o (6) where 8(s)o is the fraction of surf&ce occupied by ad- sorbed oxygen. From the experimental data it can be seen that both the oxygen and carbon mon- oxide affect the rate and therefore it is reasonable to assume that the surface is not wholly covered by any one of the reactants. Under these conditions it is possible to use the device introduced by Tem- kin and Pyzehvlo in their treatment of ammonia de- composition, namely, the use of a virtual equilibrium pressure. Then (4) ( 5 ) where p is the partial pressure of oxygen fulfilling the gas phase equilibrium at a coverage 8(s)0 of adsorbed oxygen, and b a constant. Equation (6) therefore becomes

v1 = k1Pco- f i + b ( 7 ) On the assumption that the surface is heterogeneous it is possible to apply to the present case the equa- tion developed by Temkin and Kulkova for the water gas shift on y-FezOa. In the case where the determining step of the reaction is similar to that considered here, these authors derive from equation (7) the following expression for the rate of the slow process vi = kipcopp ( 8 ) (10) M.

Thus in the pres- ent case equation (S) becomes Similarly, assuming that equation (5) is rate-de- termining one gets It can be seen that equations (9) and (10) agree well with equations (2) and (3) derived from experi- mental data, with = /3 E 0.50. Therefore, it may be concluded that equation (4) represents the determining step for the high temperature inter- val, while equation (5) that for the low tempera- ture range.Additional proof for the validity of equation (9) to represent the experimental data is given by the fact that carbon dioxide was found to have no effect on the rate at high temperatures. Similar tests for equation (10) could not be carried out with the present experimental set up.The above interpretation of the experimental data is consistent with the results of Wagner and Hauffe.l2 These authors on the basis o f semi- conductivity data concluded that the controlling step for the carbon monoxide oxidation on nickel oxide at 700 is determined by the rate of carbon monoxide interaction with the nickel oxide surface.Supporting evidence for the validity of these de- ductions may be found in the effect of additions of foreign ions to nickel oxide on the activation energy of the oxidation reaction (see following paper), Less clear are the reasons for the reversal o f the kinetics in passing from the low to the high tem- perature interval. Possibly this effect might be associated with different energy levels present in nickel oxide containing excess oxygen. Recent work of Wright and Andrews13 shows the presence o f
two levels, 7 kcal./mole and 24 kcal./mole, which could be interpreted as a surface and bulk level,respectively, being therefore operative in a differ- ent temperature interval.
On the basis of the present results it can be con- cluded that during the oxidation of carbon monox- ide on nickel oxide the concentration of excess oxy- gen in the solid phase is paramount in determining the type of kinetics followed by the oxidation reac- tion. Furthermore it is possible that the energy associated with that particular type of oxygen which is operative is responsible for changes in the over- all activation energy of the catalytic process.
