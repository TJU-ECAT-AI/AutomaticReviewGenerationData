The comprehensive characterization of doped metal oxide catalysts is crucial for understanding and optimizing their performance in various chemical processes. To verify dopant incorporation and distribution, techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are employed. These methods provide insights into the crystalline structure, chemical state, and spatial distribution of dopants within the metal oxide lattice. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offer high-resolution images that reveal the morphology and microstructure of the catalysts. To assess the effects of dopants on catalytic performance, in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, are used to monitor the catalyst under reaction conditions. These methods help in understanding the active sites and reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and oxidation (TPO) techniques provide information on the redox properties of the catalysts, which are critical for their catalytic activity. By combining these characterization methods, a holistic understanding of dopant effects on the structure and catalytic performance of metal oxide catalysts can be achieved, guiding the rational design of more efficient catalysts.
