An enhancement in the watergas shift rate was observed by doping zirconium atoms into ceria to form a binary oxide for Pt promoted catalysts. By characterization using TPR and XANES, doping zirconia to ceria decreased the temperature for the surface reduction step. However, the total number ofbridging OHgroupdefectsitesdecreased,asZrremainedtoagreatextentintheZr4+oxidation state.ThiswasconfirmedbyCOadsorption,whereby the density of total surface formates was found to decline with increased Zr concentrations. However, the formate forward turnover rate in steam was increased by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone. Both the overall rate of the formate decomposition and the watergas shift rate, as measured by the CO conversion, passed through a maximum with increasing Zr content.
Two types offormates were observed, those associated with a ceria-rich surface phase, and those associated with a zirconia-rich surface phase. The relative amounts of the two formates correlated with the Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS. EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio. The sensitivity to added carbon dioxide in the feed of the undoped and a Zr doped catalyst was also explored.

1. Introduction
Ceria is an important component in automobile catalytic converter catalysts for buffering the partial pressure of oxygen [13]. To facilitate bulk to surface oxygen transport, zirconium is typically doped into the ceria cubic matrix [46]. Ceria zirconia binary solid solutions have also been reported to exhibit far greater oxygen storage capacity (OSC) than ceria alone [7,8]. These characteristics are also of interest from the perspective of the watergas shift reaction [9].
One proposed mechanism for watergas shift is a surface formate mechanism [10,11]. In this mechanism, reduction of the surface of ceria is facilitated by addition of a metal promoter [1215], resulting in the formation of bridging OH groups at Ce3+ defect sites. One possibility for their formation is the dissociation of H2O at oxygen vacancies generated during the surface reduction process [10].

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2006.01.025 However, another possibility is direct formation of the bridging OH groups via H2 dissociation on the metal and spillover to the oxide, as follows [16].
One important role of the metal, therefore, may be to facilitate the shuttling of hydrogen to and from the surface of the ceria. Considering the surface formate mechanism [10], described below, the metal can assist in two reaction steps, including: (1) the generation of the active site bridging OH groups and (2) the removal of H2 during water-assisted surface formate decomposition [17],as follows: In the surface formate mechanism, the rate-determining step has been proposed to be the decomposition of surface formate. Interestingly, both H2O and type/loading of the metal promoter have been identified to facilitate formate decomposition, the latter recently attributed to an enhanced hydrogen abstraction rate during cleaving of the formate C H bond [17]. Hydrogen transfer processes were also recently found to be enhanced during methanol synthesis when ceria was doped into a copper containing zirconia catalyst [18],and the rate of the reaction was enhanced considerably (factor of 2.4).
It is necessary, therefore, that the surface of ceria be retained in the Ce3+ state. Interestingly, increasing the loading of Pt [16] or Au [19,20] promoter was recently found to break the metal- oxide interaction at lower and lower temperatures, facilitating the reduction of the ceria surface most likely by spillover of dissociated hydrogen from the metal to oxide. However, from a commercial viewpoint, there is a limit to the amount of noble metal promoter that can be added in an economically viable manner. Zr addition, therefore, could play an important role in decreasing the amount of noble metal promoter that is required to facilitate surface reduction. If O-transport is facilitated in the bulk of ceriazirconia over ceria alone, then it is reasonable to expect that surface O atoms would also be removed more easily from the surface of the binary oxide, so that Ce3+ atoms (i.e. oxygen vacancies) could be formed at a lower temperature than ceria alone. It also follows, then, that bridging OH groups could be generated at the surface of the catalyst at a lower temperature than that required for ceria alone. Finally, if a metal promoter is added, the formation of bridging OH groups could be anticipated to be achieved at an even lower temperature. That is, the metal-support interaction could be overcome at a lower temperature for a Pt promoted ceria zirconia catalyst relative to Pt/ceria alone. Hydrogen abstrac- tion might also be expected to occur at a faster rate during formate decomposition.
One drawback to Zr addition, though, would be the fact that Zr likely remains, to a large extent, in a 4+ oxidation state at the surface. Therefore, while Ce atoms would be expected to reduce at a lower temperature, accompanied by bridging OH group formation, the downside would be a decreased number of those defect sites. Certainly, bridging OH groups have been observed on zirconia by infrared spectroscopy, indicating that defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies or bridging OH groups) are present. However, it is anticipated, based on the above discussion, that Zr would have a lower density of bridging OH groups than Ce after a metal-promoter catalyzed surface reduction step.
An alternate proposed mechanism is that of the ceria- mediated redox process [9], which also involves reduced defect centers on the ceria surface.
In this view, the oxidation state of ceria is changing back and forth from the Ce4+ to the Ce3+ oxidation states via O transfer from the surface of ceria, with CO reducing the ceria, and H2O replenishing the oxygen vacancy. The doping of zirconia into ceria to facilitate O-mobility has been proposed to speed up the WGS rate via this process.
In this study, a number of spectroscopic techniques are used to probe these phenomena. To estimate the surface composition of Ce relative to Zr, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized. To examine whether or not a binary oxide solid solution was formed, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy
(EXAFS)
was employed. The surface reduction processes were monitored by a combination of temperature programmed reduction
(TPR)
and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). To examine the impact of zirconia addition on the intensity of formates present on the catalyst surface, as well as their decomposition rate in the presence of steam,diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy was carried out using an in situ reactor cell. Finally, activity studies were conducted using a fixed bed reactor system. The feed composition was selected to mimic typical conditions expected in the low temperature shift stage of a fuel processor for hydrogen production/purification for fuel cell applica- tions. Therefore, a high H2O:CO ratio was used, and H2 and CO2 were included in the feed.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Along with preparation of ceria and zirconia, four ceria zirconia binary oxides were also prepared,including Ce0.90Zr0.10, Ce0.75Zr0.25, Ce0.50Zr0.50, and Ce0.25Zr0.75. The precursor salts used were cerium nitrate and zirconyl nitrate,which were completely dissolved in aqueous solution that was mildly heated. Urea was used to slowly release the precipitating agent, the hydroxide ion, a technique that generally leads to a more homogenous precipitation, and significantly higher surface area materials relative to standard precipitation with ammonium nitrate alone [21]. Finally,ammonium hydroxide was added dropwise to ensure complete precipitation. The resulting precipitate was washed,filtered, dried, and calcined at 400 8C for 4 h. Tetraammine platinum (II) nitrate was the metal promoter precursor, and it was added by standard incipient wetness impregnation. After Pt addition, the catalyst was re-calcined at 400 8C for 4 h. Pt loadings for ceriazirconia catalysts have been verified by ICP analysis.
2.2. BET surface area
BET surface area measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 gas adsorption analyzer. In each test, approximately 0.250.30 g of sample (either binary oxide or Pt promoted catalyst) was used. Nitrogen adsorption was carried out at its boiling temperature.
2.3. Temperature programmed reduction
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted on binary oxide and Pt promoted catalysts using a Zeton- Altamira AMI-200 unit, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The system was modified to allow heating to as high as 1150 8C. Argon was used as the reference gas, and 10% H2 (balance Ar) was flowed through the catalyst at 30 cm3/min as the temperature was increased from 50 to 1150 8C at a ramp rate of 10 8C/min. The thermocouple was situated inside the catalyst bed. Approximately 250 mg of catalyst was used.
2.4. X-ray absorption near edge and extended X-ray
absorption fine structure spectroscopies XANES spectra at the Ce LIII and Zr K edges, and EXAFS spectra at the Zr K edge, were recorded at Beamline X-18b at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York. The beamline parameters and crystal detuning procedure have been pre- viously reported [16].
Especially in the case of binary oxide catalyst studies, it is imperative to calculate sample thicknesses beforehand. We determined sample thicknesses by calculating the amount of sample, vD, in grams per square centimeter, using the thickness equation:vD  lnI0=It=Sm=r jw j where m/r is the total cross-section (absorption coefficient/ density) of element j in the sample at the absorption edge of the EXAFS element under study in cm3/g, w j is the weight fraction of element j in the sample, and ln(I0/It) was taken over a typical range of 12.5. Using the calculation for vD, and the cross- sectional area of the pellet, the mass was readily obtained. In order to prepare a self supporting wafer, free of pin-holes, boron nitride was used to dilute the catalyst powder. After the cell was purged for a long period with inert gas at a high flow rate to ensure air removal, the samples were treated in situ using a hydrogen/helium mixture (150 cm3/min H2 and 500 cm3/min He). Samples were scanned in the temperature range of room temperature to 300 8C. Scans were obtained in transmission mode to confirm the temperature for surface shell reduction of the partially reducible oxide. XANES spectra were back- ground-subtracted and normalized prior to comparison. Stan- dard data reduction methods were utilized to process the EXAFS results including edge calibration, background sub- traction, normalization, truncation, conversion to k-space, and background subtraction in k-space using appropriate splines to determine chi(k). Finally, an appropriate k-range was selected,and the Fourier transform was carried out. The Fourier trans- form magnitude spectra were compared qualitatively.
2.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS experiments were monitored with a Thermo VG Scientific Minilab. Mg Ka X-ray (kinetic energy 1273 eV) were used with a dual cathode X-ray gun. The pressure was maintained in analysis chamber generally between 9 and 5E10 Torr. The data were collected using a hemispherical electron analyzer.
The spectra were first baseline corrected. Then, for both ceria and zirconia, the areas for the 3d3/2 and the 3d5/2 peaks were calculated, and for oxygen and carbon, the areas of the 1s peak were calculated. Scofield factors [22] were employed to estimate the different atomic ratios of interest (e.g. Zr/Ce, Ce/ O, Zr/O, and (Ce + Zr)/O) for each sample. Prior to plotting the XPS results, carbon was subtracted out and the spectra were normalized relative to the Ce, Zr, and O signals alone, for purposes of comparison.
2.6. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform
spectroscopy A Nicolet Nexus 870 was used, equipped with a DTGS- TEC detector. A chamber fitted with ZnSe windows was utilized as the WGS reactor for in situ measurements. During a run the catalyst was first activated at 300 8C in hydrogen and then cooled to 130 8C in nitrogen. Formates were generated on the surface by adsorption of CO, whereby the flows were maintained at 3.75 cm3/min CO and 135 cm3/min

37 N2 (i.e. 2.7% CO). After the pseudo-stabilized formate was generated, the cell was purged with N2 and a mixture of
H2O:N2 was flowed at 63:135 cm3/min (i.e. 32% H2O).
Decomposition of the formate was recorded with time to provide an indication of the impact of the Zr dopant on the formate decomposition rate for the Pt/ceria system.
2.7. Reaction testing
Steady state catalytic activity and carbon dioxide sensitivity measurements were carried out using a fixed bed reactor system consisting of a 0.500 stainless steel tube with an internal thermocouple located inside the catalyst bed. Experiments were conducted using 200 mg of catalyst diluted with 1.8 g of silica beads. Conditions were chosen to reflect those in a fuel processor following the high temperature shift stage, including H2 and CO2 in the feed. The following conditions were selected: H2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 = 26.1:3:29.8:11.2:29.9%. Total gas flow = 250 cm3/min.
The sensitivity of the catalyst to carbon dioxide was also carried out. Inert balancing gas was replaced by carbon dioxide to maintain constant the partial pressures of the other gas constituents, as well as the total gas space velocity.
Switching was carried out from the initial conditions without
CO2H2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 = 30.8:3.5:35.1:0:30.6%,
to the carbon dioxide-containing conditionsH2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 =
30.8:3.5:35.1:8.0:22.6%, and then returning to the conditions
without CO2, in the temperature range of 235275 8C. Total gas flow = 212 cm3/min.
3. Results and discussion
Results of BET surface area measurements are reported in Table 1. The surface areas ranged from 108 to 156 m2/g, while the average pore volume remained quite uniform. For all of the catalysts, except Pt/ZrO2, the surface area decreased somewhat with Pt loading, while the average pore radius typically increased slightly. This behavior usually represents some blocking of the narrowest pores by the metal. The increase in BET surface area for Pt/ZrO2 was verified several times,although no suitable explanation was found.
XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter. In Fig. 1A, there is a general increasing trend in area with Zr loading. However, the trend is by no means linear. In fact, the Zr composition at the surface was quite similar for the 10%, 25%,and even 50% Zr-doped samples. A large increase was observed in moving to the 75% Zr sample. The Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2 peaks could be fitted very well using two Gaussian distribu- tions. Similarly, for ceria, there is a general decreasing trend,but the greatest change was again observed between 50% and 75% Zr levels, while the results for the 10%, 25%, and 50% samples are more similar. The peaks for Ce 3d are complex (Fig. 1B), and are split into the 3/2 and 5/2 ionizations. The bands are further complicated by satellite features commonly assigned with the letter v for 3d5/2 and u for 3d3/2 and given primed labels [23,24].
Peaks labeled v (882 eV),v0 (885.5 eV), v00 (889 eV), and v000 (898 eV) belong collectively to the Ce 3d5/2 ionization, while bands u (901 eV),u0 (904 eV),u00 (907.5 eV),and u000 (916.5 eV) belong to the Ce 3d3/2 ionization. The bands were fitted well with eight Gaussian curves, except in the region between approximately 910 and 912 eV, which was excluded from the fitting range. Due to charging effects, very pronounced for insulator materials, spectral shifts were not analyzed.
Rather, we were interested only in obtaining information regarding relative surface concentrations.
A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C). The total areas remained quite similar, as should be the case considering the stoichiometry. A feature at higher binding energy was noted, labeled O0 1s (531.7 eV), and is typically assigned to chemisorbed O-containing species, such as OH or C- containing species such as CO or CO2 [23]. As outlined in Table 2, the relative atomic O concentration was found to be very close to twice the value of the Ce + Zr concentrations. The Zr/Ce ratios deviated from their bulk values somewhat,especially in the case of the 10% Zr and 50% Zr samples.
Although the increasing trend of Zr surface concentration is observed with increasing bulk levels, the change was marginal from 10% Zr to 25% Zr, and also from 25% Zr to 50% Zr. Two factors could account for this. One is that, above a certain level,the zirconia no longer is doped into the ceria surface, but rather forms islands of a zirconia rich bulk phase. The other possibility is that a solid solution forms, but that the surface is enriched with zirconia until a level of 50% Zr doping is achieved.
The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively. In moving away from the absorber, the first major peak encountered is located at 1.7 A . This peak is readily assigned to ZrO bonds. For the pure ZrO2 sample, the peak in the range of 33.5 A is assigned to the ZrZr coordination in the oxide.
For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing

[5]. The assignment follows from the fact that the peak is quite intense for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample, which would be expected to exhibit a high degree of ZrCe coordination from the 3:1 stoichiometry of Ce/Zr, but much less so for the Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 material, with a stoichiometry of only 1:1. It is strongly suggested, therefore, from the EXAFS results, that a solid solution was, to a measurable degree, formed.
It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data.
The Zr/Ce ratio for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 material was close to the

The secondary O 1s band, labeled O0 1s, is indicative of chemisorbed surface OH and carbonoxygen containing species. expected result if a solid solution had formed, as suggested by
EXAFS. On the other hand, for Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, the Zr/Ce ratio
was much less than the expected value for a true solid solution,and this also correlates with the EXAFS findings, as the coordination of Zr to Zr (peak at 3 A ) was clearly much higher than Zr to Ce (peak at 3.7 A ), indicating a lower degree of mixing.
For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]. As described by Yao and Yao [25],the reduction of ceria typically occurs in two steps. For unpromoted ceria, the bulk reduction occurs above 750 8C, while the surface shell reduction step takes place at much lower temperature (400550 8C region). We interpret the surface shell reduction to involve several phenomena [16], including: (1) liberation of surface carbonates, (2) reduction of Ce surface atoms from the Ce4+ to the Ce3+ oxidation state, and (3) formation of bridging OH groups. The latter may occur via oxygen vacancy generation followed by dissociative adsorption of H2O. Fig. 3A displays the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for the binary oxide CeZr materials. As reported in the literature [26], the bulk reduction step is facilitated by incorporation of just 10% Zr, as the peak maximum shifts from about 875 8C for ceria to about 825 8C with doping of zirconia.
Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C.
Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups.
For example, as displayed in Fig. 3B, for ceria that is not doped with Zr, 1% Pt addition catalyzes the surface reduction step to around 225300 8C. Remarkably, addition of Zr further shifts this peak to lower temperature, even below 200 8C in the case of the 2575% Zr addition range. The peak reaches a limit of about 185 8C for the 2550% Zr addition range. The peak for zirconia promoted with 1% Pt occurred in a broader range, with a sharp peak at 210 8C, and a much broader peak extending up to 400 8C.
To verify that a true facilitation in the reduction of the ceria component occurred, XANES was employed, and results are depicted in Fig. 4A and B. A detailed discussion of XANES profiles and reference materials for Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states has been provided in our earlier work [16], and will not be repeated here. Nevertheless, spectra for references of Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states are provided in Fig. 4C. The Ce4+ oxidation state is characterized by two main peaks, commonly assigned B1 (lower energy peak) and C (higher energy peak).
During reduction, peak C disappears, and peak B0 develops at a position slightly lower in energy than B1 [26,27]. Peak B0 is very intense for pure Ce3+ materials (e.g., cerous carbonate [16]). After surface shell reduction occurs, a partial change is realized, and consists of a superimposition of the two states, as the bulk remains in the Ce4+ oxidation state. Overbury et al.
[26] have demonstrated that Zr addition facilitates both the temperature and extent of bulk ceria reduction. In our case, we are primarily interested in whether or not Zr can also facilitate primarily the temperature of surface shell reduction. It is well- known that adding the noble metal will reduce virtually the entire CeO2 surface [27]. Therefore, it is not expected the Zr would assist in improving the extent of reduction at the surface,since Zr could remain in the Zr4+ oxidation state to a large degree. Indeed, as shown by comparison between Fig. 4A and B, the surface reduction is shifted from about 250 to 200 8C

(and likely below that, as a partial change is evident even at 175 8C, in agreement with TPR) for the Pt promoted catalysts with addition of Zr. Fig. 4C shows that the white line for Zr does not deviate much from the Zr4+ oxidation state, though it is well known that vacancies or their associated bridging OH groups do in fact form on Zr surfaces [28,29], analogous to those on Ce [3032] and Th [33,34].
Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5AC show that, after the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in agreement with earlier studies. There are marked decreases in the intensity of bridging OH bands (3650 cm1 for ceria-rich phase and 3700 cm1 for the zirconia-rich phase), and accompanied by thisdecrease,thereare increasesinCH bands(2840,2950 cm1 for ceria and 2880, 2970 cm1 for zirconia) and OCO bands (1580, 1350 cm1 for asymmetric and symmetric, respectively [35]). The Zr formates increase relative to the Ce formates with increasing Zr addition, is better shown in the formate CH streatching region (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, in agreement with the XPSdata,thechangeisnotlinear.Only a slightchangeisnotedin moving from the 25% to 50% Zr loadings, while a more important change is detected between 50% and 75% Zr. Fig. 5C shows that the overall intensity of formates decreases as a function of Zr loading. This follows from the earlier XANES discussion. Since Zr remains largely Zr4+, there are less defect sites, and therefore, less bridging OH groups on the surface for formate formation. Therefore, we cannot expect to increase the formate intensity by addition of Zr to the surface. However, we may hope for enhanced hydrogen transfer rates based on the TPR, or perhaps a different promoting effect on the rate.
Adsorption of CO also provides some indication of the Pt dispersion. As shown in Fig. 5A, the broad PtCO band (1900 2100 cm1) is similar in intensity among the catalyst samples,indicating comparable Pt dispersions.
Regarding formate stability, there are several important findings of note to date. Formates are quite stable at low temperature, and they slowly decompose thermally (i.e. in the absence of H2O) primarily back to CO and OH [10] (i.e. reverse formate decomposition). We have found, for example,that at 240 8C, it takes more than 1 h to decompose the formates completely (<5% initial value) on 2.5% Pt/ceria. Yet for 2.5% Pt/ceria, with H2O addition, formates decomposed completely at 130 8C (110 8C lower temperature) in less than 20 min. Clearly, the formate decomposition is reactant- promoted by H2O, in agreement with the findings of Shido and Iwasawa [10]. Interestingly, changing from Au to Pt, or increasing the loading of either metal, was found to enhance the formate decomposition rate further [16,17]. Therefore, the metal may play a role in increasing the hydrogen abstraction rate.As shown in Fig. 6AE, the formate decomposition rate in steam is also enhanced by addition of Zr to the Ce. The rate reaches a maximum at about 50% Zr, and then decreases again. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, CO2 was evolved during formate decomposition, but the PtCO band did not change measurably during steam addition. For Pt/ZrO2, the formate intensity was too low to obtain a quantifiable rate during steaming. Nevertheless, we did stop H2O addition and rapidly purge with N2 to find out how much formate remained on the surface after 12.2 min (Fig. 6F). While good

The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts. The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts. It appears, then, that there may be a correlation between the WGS rate and the formate decomposi- tion step, as proposed by Shido and Iwasawa [10].
Assuming a first order decay of the formate, we estimated the first order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4).
However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a maximum at 50% Zr addition. Therefore, the total rate can be estimated to be proportional to the number of active sites multiplied by their turnover rate. Ranking the catalysts in this relative manner, we can see that the total rate reaches a maximum at 50% Zr addition. The findings are in agreement with the trend observed in the WGS rates from fixed bed reactor tests (an example is provided at 250 8C in Table 4).
We consider three possible explanations for the enhanced rates observed on the Pt/ceriazirconia catalysts relative to the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia catalysts. First, considering the surface formate mechanism, there are two possibilities that appear feasible that could account for enhanced formate decomposi- tion rates. Considering the original surface formate mechanism of Shido and Iwasawa [10], coadsorbed H2O promotes the decomposition rate. Therefore, addition of Zr4+ at the surface of Pt/ceria (i.e. which is virtually completely reduced at the surface) would be expected to lead to a lowering in the total

Formates are generated upon reaction of CO with bridging OH groups at defects on the surface of zirconia (3700 cm1), ceria (3650 cm1), or the mixed oxide. Formate bands arising on the surface indicate that there are two major contributions, surface formates on the ceria-rich surface positioned at approximately 2840 cm1 (2950 cm1) and a surface formate arising on the zirconia-rich surface positioned at approximately 2880 cm1 (2970 cm1).

This is, as previously mentioned, reflected in the initial formate intensities upon CO adsorption. However, this in turn leaves sites open for molecular adsorption of H2O, and hence, could account for improved formate decomposition rates. The model is essentially a two-site model, one involving Ce3+ and one involving Zr4+.
A second possibility is that the hydrogen abstraction rate may be higher for the zirconia promoted materials. Recently, Pt clusters were found to facilitate formate decomposition at a rate of about 20 times that of Au clusters after a similar initial formate concentration was achieved [17]. The difference was reflected in the relative WGS rates of the Pt materials relative to Au. Furthermore, increasing Pt or Au loadings led to enhanced formate decomposition rates, and increased WGS rates.Therefore, hydrogen abstraction from the formate (and neigh- boring bridging OH group) could be facilitated by Pt. Judging by the TPR profiles, there may be an improved hydrogen transfer rate for the ceriazirconia materials, stemming from the more facile reduction of the materials.
A third possibility considers a different mechanism, the ceria-mediated redox model [21,37,38]. In that mechanism, CO adsorbed on the metal (Pt) reacts with the partially reducible oxide component at the interface to liberate CO2 and reduce the Ce4+ to Ce3+. In this proposed scheme, re-oxidation of ceria by H2O occurs at the vacancies freeing up H2 product. It is conceivable then, that improved O mobility could facilitate the reaction rate based on this model. It is important to note that one basis for the redox model was that formates were not observed upon CO addition to the reduced ceria surface. Our results are

a Extrapolated from point at 12.2 min (see Fig. 7) assuming first order decay to the point. in striking contrast to those findings. Recently, it has been suggested that the feed composition may play a role in determining which of the two mechanisms may be operating [39]. We have suggested, based on several studies, including,among others, isotopic tracer [40,41] and kinetic isotope effect studies [42,43], that when H2 and H2O are in abundance in the feed, the traditional formate mechanism [10] appears to be appropriate. Nevertheless, the redox model [44] also offers an important basis for future research.
The sensitivity of metal promoted partially reducible oxides to carbon dioxide is an issue that remains unresolved [38,45,46]. As pointed out recently by Balakos et al. [47],excellent watergas shift catalysts in a feed without carbon dioxide can exhibit poor activity when appropriate levels of CO2 are added to the feed. Because there are, reportedly, less carbonates for materials doped with Zr (see Fig. 8), it is anticipated that Pt promoted CeZr binary oxides may be more resistant to the negative effect of carbon dioxide. A number of switching tests were carried out to probe this phenomenon (Table 5). Inert balancing gas was used in a feed containing CO, H2O, and H2, and then it was replaced by an equivalent amount of CO2, so that the partial pressures of CO, H2O, and H2 in the feed remained constant, and such that the total gas velocity remained constant. Comparing at similar conversion levels, the percentage drop in WGS during carbon dioxide addition was found to be quite similar among the catalysts tested (Pt/ceria, Pt/zirconia, and Pt/ceria zirconia). As shown in Table 5, the data was recorded away from the thermodynamic limit. Interestingly, though, after switching off the carbon dioxide, the Pt/ceriazirconia catalyst material displayed about an 810% greater recovery,indicating that the catalyst was less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by carbon dioxide. This result suggests that CO2 liberation is facilitated by zirconia addition and that this is an explanation for the higher rate with the incorporation of lower levels of Zr.
4. Conclusions
A measurable improvement in the watergas shift rate was realized by doping zirconium atoms into ceria to form a binary oxide for Pt promoted catalysts. While addition of zirconia to ceria decreased the temperature for surface shell reduction of ceria, as monitored by TPR and XANES, the total number of defect sites (and their corresponding bridging OH group active centers) at the surface decreased. The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone. The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum. A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum.
Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion. The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS. XPS further showed that while increasing the Zr content in general led to higher Zr levels at the surface, the results did not correlate directly to the bulk ratios. EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was obtained, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe

The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide.
However, from a kinetic viewpoint, Pt/ceria, Pt/zirconia, and Pt/ceriazirconia catalysts all decreased in CO conversion with CO2 addition to the feed. The only benefit with Zr addition to the catalysts appeared when CO2 was switched off, whereby the catalysts were observed to exhibit a better activity recovery.
