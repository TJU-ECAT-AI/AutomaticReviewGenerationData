IR spectroscopy is a technique particularly adapted for understanding the mechanism of catalytic reactions, being able to probe the surface mechanisms at the molecular level. In this critical review the main advances in the field are presented, both under the aspects of the in situ and operando approaches. A broad view of the most authoritative literature of the domain is given, based largely on the experience built up at the LCS laboratory in the last decades. After having presented the general methodology to observe a potential active site directly or by probe molecule adsorption,several examples illustrate the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the physicalchemical properties of the surface entities. The last part of the review is dedicated to the discrimination of the role of the active site and its links with the catalytic steps; the hot problem of the reaction intermediates and their visibility via spectroscopic techniques is critically addressed (138 references).
Introduction Heterogeneous catalysis is finding an increasing importance in everyday life. The industrial heterogeneous catalysts are shaped multifunctional devices intended to offer to the reacting agents a multitude of active sites, distributed on the external surface or inside the porosity of the materials, in order to optimise the contact between the reacting molecule and the transformation centre in the sense of the Sabatiers principle.
On these sites the reacting molecules are adsorbed, the inter- mediates are generated and the products formed. Physically,the active centres are the sites where the reaction crosses the energy barrier, as classically represented in Fig. 1.
Therefore, the active sites are intrinsically linked with the intermediate species and they can be affected by the poisons which can be formed during the reaction. An accurate design of the active sites (in terms of quality, strength, position, . . .) is obviously the key to obtain the optimum catalyst. On the way to catalyst optimisation and rational design, we have to thoroughly characterize the active sites, particularly when in action, considering that they are not static entities, but they undergo modifications depending on the reaction conditions and surface restructuration phenomena. For this purpose, IR spectroscopy is one of the most adapted tools, being extremely sensitive to the molecular vibrations and able to discriminate the different geometrical distortions of the molecules according to the adsorption state on a site.
In this contribution, we will present how it is possible to evidence the adsorption sites on a catalyst, particularly using Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie, ENSICAEN, Universite de Caen, CNRS, 6 Bd Mare chal Juin, F-14050 Caen, France.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4929 probe molecules. We will describe the most accurate methodo- logies to obtain information on physicalchemical properties of the sites, as well as on their concentration and strength. We will show then how to differentiate an active site from a bare adsorption centre by coupling FT-IR with catalytic evidences.
We will finally discuss briefly the problem of the detection limit of intermediate species (intrinsically linked to active sites) using infrared spectroscopy.
Surface adsorption site identification on a catalyst The best identification of the potential active sites by IR spectroscopy is the direct detection of their IR fingerprint.
The best examples are probably those given by the zeolites, for which the strong Brnsted-acid sites are often identified through the n(OH) band of hydroxyl groups. If this is not possible, specific methods must be employed to obtain a spectroscopic response for the sites. The most common is the adsorption of probe molecules, which provides IR spectra specific to the interaction with a single site. From the spectro- scopic point of view, several reviews have given criteria about the choice of the right molecule,35 However, without any further considerations, it is worthwhile noticing that whatever the probe molecule used, it generates a perturbation of the surface of the catalysts: indirect perturbations such as electron withdrawing effect, or direct perturbations like chemical reactions (protonation, electron transfer, decomposition, . . .). These phenomena can be considered as invasive, but according to the probe used and the chemical reaction considered, this can also give information on the dynamic response of a surface to the molecule adsorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that whatever the probe molecule used, the best one is the reactant itself, providing the same perturbation as during the chemical catalytic reaction. In this view, the best conditions for a study appear to be those during the reaction, i.e. the operando conditions (real in situ);6 we will develop this point towards the end of the review.
The spectroscopic study of the adsorption sites on a catalyst surface requires a good knowledge of the surface state itself, as well as an excellent reproducibility of the characterisation, to fix the parameters and the limits of the surface description. In this view, it is necessary to be aware of the presence and nature of surface impurities, to establish how to clean the surface and make the sites accessible.
Impurities and surface activation IR is a very sensitive technique for detecting surface impurities such as water, carbonates (formed by catalyst contact with ambient atmosphere), organics and other residual species after synthesis, such as nitrates, sulfates, templates, etc., because these species present characteristic bands in the IR spectra.
Although many of these species do not represent a real problem for catalytic reactions, being often eliminated at the temperature at which the process takes place, or even taking a beneficial role in the reaction itself, their presence may inhibit (at least partially) probe adsorption, or simply disturb the correct spectral interpretation by band overlapping. Band position and intensity can vary depending on the sample nature; an abundant literature exists describing these spectra (see for example ref. 5). Thermal stability of these species strongly depends on acidbase properties of the material: on relatively acidic compounds (alumina, zirconia, . . .) carbonate and nitrate species can be removed at mild temperatures. On basic oxides, such as MgO, carbonate impurities can still be observed after a thermal treatment at 750 1C. In the case of sulfates, a reducing treatment at higher temperature is even necessary to clean the surface, but traces of sulfur can remain.7 Nevertheless, we should consider the fact that these residual species are essentially bulk moieties, almost inert during the catalytic process; therefore it is better to leave them in place rather than to heat the sample at very high temperature (with the aim to clean all the impurities), so producing a drastic sintering of its surface.
It is much more difficult to detect the presence of alien anionic entities such as sulfur, Cl and F, or cationic species Fig. 1 reaction profile and intermediates in the simple case of a process going through two elemental reaction steps A - I - B: a is the profile for a non catalytic thermal reaction; b is a catalytic reaction using a good catalyst; c is a catalytic reaction using a bad catalyst.
If I is an intermediate with a low stability, it is hard to detect; if I0 is a stable intermediate it will easily be detected. The transition state A* or I* is not detectable.1,2 Marco Daturi Marco Daturi was born in Genoa (Italy) in 1964.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 such as alkaline cations in the zeolites, due to the absence of specific bands. An indirect method consists in the observation of the n(OH) range of the catalyst spectrum: OH/Cl, OH/F substitutions and OH/ONa+ alkali exchange strongly modify the intensity and the position of the n(OH) bands. These impurities and contaminants strongly influence the acidbase properties of the samples. As an example, Cl, F and sulfate species can increase the strength of the acid sites on alumina,8 whereas sodium (even if present in as small quantities as 300 ppm) poisons the strongest Lewis-acid sites,9,10 Traces of chloride also hinder oxygen mobility on cerium-based com- pounds11 and inhibit the oxidation properties of the supported metals.12 Effect of the temperature of activation The increase of the temperature of activation for metal oxides not only removes the impurities and molecularly adsorbed water but also leads to surface reconstruction, due to the elimination of hydroxyls, according to the mechanism involving two MOH groups: 2 MOH - MOM + H2O (with the possible creation of a vacancy). In extreme conditions, if the activation temperature exceeds the calcination conditions during sample synthesis, sintering phenomena can also occur.13 The thermal treatment leads to surface reconstruction, and the amounts of exposed OH groups, cationic, anionic and defective sites, which govern their acidbase and redox properties,are not predictable, but can be estimated by IR absorption experiments of probe molecules at various temperatures. The most complete IR studies about the effect of the temperature of activation on the surface modification spectroscopy probably deal with MgO and alumina.1417 Direct observation of the active sites Case of Brnsted-acid sites. Direct observation of the poten- tial active sites is possible when Brnsted-acid sites are con- sidered and this possibility is well illustrated by the zeolites or silica, for which the hydroxyl groups can be directly observed through their n(OH) bands. The spectrum of hydroxyl groups of steamed HY zeolite (Fig. 2) allows one to observe the acidic OH group located in different sites: bridged hydroxy groups in supercages (3625 cm1), or in sodalite cages (3545 cm1).
Perturbation of bridged OH groups by extraframework entities generates highly acidic species with specific n(OH) band (3602 cm1 for those in the supercages, 3520 in the sodalite cages). For this zeolite, the presence of the 3602 cm1 band is often related to the activity of the catalyst in strongly demanding reactions like n-hexane cracking,18,19 The OH bands in the dealuminated Y zeolites have been studied in detail and a new model has been proposed recently.20 Such a sensitivity to the environment is well illustrated with the IR spectra of the mordenite, which presents three nOH bands,depending on the location (Fig. 2b).21 The spectra of the sample during the conversion of xylene show that only the hydroxy groups present inside the main channels act as active sites towards the isomerisation reaction. Sites located in the narrow side pockets are not catalytically active, but have a strong influence on selectivity. This case illustrates nicely the fact that the direct observation of the potential sites can give valuable indications on the reaction protagonists.22 Thermally activated divided metal oxides present residual OH groups having IR stretching frequencies related to the nature of surface cations. The multiplicity of the n(OH) bands of oxides such as alumina has been mainly explained invoking:(i) the multifold coordination of the hydroxyls themselves (linear species giving rise to n(OH) bands at a higher frequency than those characterising bridged species), (ii) the coordination number of the cation to which OH groups are bound, (iii) the presence of morphologic defects on the surface (edges, corners,etc.). In the case of many oxides such as Al2O3, Ga2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, the higher n(OH) wavenumber component presents a basic rather than acidic character, as shown by CO2 experiments.2325 Their relation to defect crystallographic sites has also been invoked considering the sensitivity of this component to the presence of coordinated species in the neighborhood.24 This shows that the co-existence of several types of sites on the surface complicates the relation between a n(OH) band and a well defined Brnsted surface sites in the case of metal oxides.
Case of Lewis-acid sites. Direct IR observation of a Lewis-acid site itself is not possible since a coordinatively unsaturated site is not a vibrator. Considering the Lewis site and its first coordination sphere, the vibrations (metaloxygen vibrations for metal oxides) are generally coupled with the very intense bands from the bulk vibration modes and only studied by mixing the samples with KBr; therefore only hydrated solids are generally studied. However in few cases,defect sites are detected in the IR spectrum of activated samples by specific IR bands, mainly in the low frequency range: bands situated at 3782/880 cm1 on beta zeolite26 and around 960 cm1 on Ti-silicalite27 can be considered as a fingerprint of Lewis-acid sites and have been partly related to the enhanced activity of these Lewis-acid catalysts in the catalyzed MeerweinPondorfVerley

Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4931 of Lewis acidity is possible is limited, and complementary IR adsorption experiments using probe molecules are often necessary.
Probe molecule use. The direct detection of adsorption sites by IR spectroscopy is often not possible, therefore specific methods must be employed to obtain a spectroscopic response of the sites. The most common is the adsorption of probe molecules which gives IR spectra specific to the interaction with the site, as mentioned above. Concerning the choice of the appropriate probe molecule, Lercher et al.3 gave special emphasis to the criteria that have to be met to arrive at a characterization of materials that are useful for catalytic application, selecting the right molecule for the right site. The choice of the adapted probe will depend on many parameters:the chemical function providing the interaction with the site under study; the size of the molecule, depending on the site accessibility; the optimum of the interaction (sufficient to furnish valuable information, not excessive so as to limit surface modifications); the spectral response, producing a signal intense enough, with band positions sensitive to the interaction;stability on the surface catalyst to avoid decomposition; and sufficient vapour pressure to be easily introduced in an IR cell.
The investigated sites are very often cations, acting as Lewis centres, but infrared spectroscopy has also been widely used in order to characterize the metallic centres in oxides and deposited metal complex. Even if direct investigations on metaloxygen vibrations are reported3133 most of the studies related with catalysis are dealing with the adsorption of probe molecules. Among these molecules, N2, methanol, NO and CO are frequently used and the latter two are also by far the most common in the literature. In 2002 a very complete review concerning the infrared spectra of chemisorbed carbon monoxide as a characterization tool for the cationic sites of oxides34 was published. A specific property of CO is that the slightly antibonding HOMO 5s orbital is occupied. This orbital is very important for the electron-donating properties of CO, because a decrease of electron occupation on this orbital leads to stabilization of the entire molecule and thus to an increase of the n(CO) wavenumber (compared to the n(CO) for the gas phase at 2143.5 cm1). On the contrary, the addition of electron density from a metal d orbital to one of the 2p* LUMO orbitals (so called p back donation) leads to a substantial decrease of the vibrational frequency of CO, i.e. to a weakening of the CO bond. As far as the red-ox properties are concerned and in the ideal case, the expected information with CO as a probe are the following:oxidation state of the cations on the surface,coordination state of these cations,location of the cations on flat planes or other surface structures,location of the active phase on the support,surface phase analysis,existence of strong oxidizing agents on the surface.
The characterization of the various sites on mixed oxides can be advantageously carried out by CO adsorption at various equilibrium pressures at low temperature, followed by evacuation at increasing temperatures to obtain infor- mation about the stabilities of the various species. Although the CO stretching frequency is the most informative parameter,the data determining the stabilities of the various species can be decisive for the assignment of the bands. Multiple carbonyls adsorbed on the same metal cation are possible and in order to identify them, isotopic mixtures should be used. This was the case, for example, of a PtNamordenite sample, where the use of a 12CO13CO isotopic mixture combined with analysis of the second derivatives of the spectra was very useful for proving the polycarbonyl structures.35 Again, using iso- topic labeled 13CO and 15NO molecules mixed with their most abundant analogues, it was possible to describe the multiplicity and symmetry of CO and NO ligands on a complex coordinated with Rh2+ in a Rh-ZSM-5 sample;geometrical structures and band assignments were supported by DFT computational results.36 However, sometimes the polycarbonyls are very stable and in this case, if 12CO is adsorbed first and then 13CO introduced, mixed species may not form at ambient temperature.
Concerning NO, Hadjiivanov37 reported that the coordi- nation of the NO molecule to a cationic site via the nitrogen atom is accompanied by a partial charge transfer from the 5s orbital together with an increase in the bond order, just as in the case of CO. Formation of a p-back-bond, although not as easy as with CO, is also possible, and this results in a decrease in the NO stretching modes. The different surface mononitrosyls absorb in a wide spectral range: 19661710 cm1.
When only a s bond is formed, a frequency above that of gaseous NO (1876 cm1) is expected, whereas with low-valent cations, rich in d-electrons, p-back donation is possible and the NO stretching modes can fall below 1876 cm1. Cations having no d-electrons produce mononitrosyls only; on the contrary, dimeric molecules are very often the principal adspecies on transition metal cations. This is the case of NO adsorption on V-, Cr-, Mo-, W-, Fe-, Cu- and Co-containing oxide systems where the metal cations are not in their highest oxidation state. Thus, it is clear that a p-back donation stabilizes dinitrosyls. Examples of complementary information obtained by CO and NO coadsorption are also available.38 Acid sites. A review by Busca39 describes the bases of IR spectroscopic methods for the characterization of the surface acidity (both of Lewis and Brnsted type), on different mixed oxides. A systematization is proposed associating the surface acidity with the ionicity/covalency of the elementoxygen bond, mainly affected by the size and charge of the cation.
In a parallel work, the results obtained for the characterization of the Lewis-acid strength of more than 30 binary and ternary mixed oxides are interpreted on the basis of the different polarizing powers of the involved cations.40 Recent progress on acidity characterization is reviewed elsewhere and described to be related to the broadening of the spectral range (investigation of overtones, combination bands, and low- frequency modes) and to the adsorption of new non-traditional probe molecules for identification of acid sites.41,42 Some examples on oxide and zeolitic compounds.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 acidity. Its size has to be small enough to interact with all available sites and to avoid confinement effects43 but its basic strength has to be strong enough to interact even with the weakest acidic sites. Ammonia seems to be a good candidate for this but due to the high polarity of the NH bonds,hydrogen bonding with basic entities governs the coordination of adsorbed species and direct conclusions about acidic strength are not straightforward.44 That is why most often the adsorption of several probe molecules is required. For example, the FAU and the MOR structures are made of big and small cavities in which some acidic hydroxyls are out of reach of basic molecules such as pyridine. Co-adsorbing the strongly basic trimethylamine (TMA) and NH3 (see Fig. 3), we were recently able to give for the first time an infrared evidence of three distinct acidic hydroxyls in defect-free HY,45 to give an assignment for the corresponding wavenumbers and to characterize their respective acidic strength.46 Moreover, TMA desorption associated with the recovery of hydroxyls at 3656 and 3638 cm1 (and two corresponding n(NH) bands reveal the presence of at least two distinct acidic strengths for the hydroxyls located inside the supercages. For the same site location, the local chemical factor should then play a role: the aluminium distribution in the framework is not necessarily homogeneous, and the number of Al next-nearest neighbours influences the acidic strength of a given site. Another explana- tion for the unusual 3656 cm1 component could be that part of the O4 crystallographic sites is a proton holder for this low Si/Al ratio HY sample; in such a case, all the four theoretically forecasted sites in the zeolitic FAU structure would have been observed by IR spectroscopy.46 The combined use of these two molecules moreover helped us to better characterize the various coordinated NH4 + and determine the activity ranking between the ammonium species and coordinated ammonia over Lewis sites during NOx SCR.47 In the zeolites, some strong Lewis-acid sites can be obtained during steaming leading to the formation of extra-framework aluminium species. Mild Lewis sites may be naturally present (in the alkaline form) or generated upon ionic exchange with transition metals which are necessary for NOx SCR with hydrocarbons. For over-exchange level, some Lewis species may remain on the external surface and coadsorption of the bulky ortho-toluonitrile and CO was recently reported to identify the different Con+ species and their location in a Co H-MFI zeolite.48 In this respect, the use of the nitrile probe provided more precise evidences about the distribution of Co species in active CH4-SCR Co-HMFI than those arising from previous UVvis, EXAFS and XRD data.4953 The oTN (ortho-toluonitrile) and NO co-adsorption allowed to determine that a significant amount of cobalt species is at the external surface, mostly in the form of divalent cobalt. On the other hand, in the internal surface part of Co species are trivalent, together with predominant divalent Co ions. These observations coupled with those coming from the operando study were valuable for reactivity explanation, inferring that the active sites for CH4-SCR in Co-MFI are Co3+ species (presence of a nitrosyl n(NO) band at 1930 cm1) located in the cavities, but likely in non-classical cation positions, which are able to convert NO to an adsorbed bridging nitrate species,that can be later decomposed to give gas phase NO2.54 Moreover, the cavity may contribute to the stabilization of aggregates containing trivalent cobalt. At the same time, the presence of Co-isocyanates involved in the SCR suggests that a possible route for the reaction implies the reduction of nitrate-like species by methane, forming H2O and isocyanates,which could later react with NO producing N2 and CO2. On the contrary, it seemed that substitutional Co2+ ions did not play a key role in the reaction, being very likely almost redox-inactive. Co2+-dinitrosyls formed on them being decomposed well below the reaction temperature, they did not seem to be involved in the reaction.54 These considerations linking the active site with the reactivity of the species coordinated on it and with the possible intermediates can be generalized to all the reactions and will be discussed later in this review.Metalorganic framework: the ideal case for spectroscopic identification of adsorption sites. In the case of the metal oxides, surface relaxation and reconstruction phenomena might not allow to accurately identify the nature of the Lewis-acid sites (coordination, oxidation degree, unsaturation degree) via the study of spectra after the adsorption of probe molecules. On the contrary, this is not the case for the majority of hybrid organicinorganic solids such as MOFs (metalorganic frameworks), which are crystalline nanoporous solids, with a framework of inorganic units (clusters, chains or planes) and organic linkers (phosphonates, carboxylates, sulfonates). The majority of MOFs present framework metal sites that can exhibit coordinative vacancies upon solvent removal; such sites represent Lewis-acid centers of well defined symmetry and oxidation degree. As has been shown in the case of MIL-10055 and H-KUST56,57 it is possible to assign in a clear and indisputable way the bands due to the adsorbed species,like those (still debated nowadays) for carbonyls or nitrosyls coordinated on cations such as chrome, copper and iron. CO adsorption on MIL-100/101(Cr) is an example of the con- tribution of IR to the identification of the potential active sites in MOF.55,58,59 Three n(CO) bands are observed at 2207,2200 and 2193 cm1 (Fig. 4), showing that Cr3+ sites are Fig. 3 Infrared spectra of the HY sample upon TMA adsorption and NH3 saturation evidencing OH in the supercages at 3637 cm1, OH in the sodalite units at 3548 cm1 and OH in the hexagonal prism at 3501 cm1 (from ref. 45).

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4933 not equivalent. This heterogeneity is attributed to the possible presence of fluoride ions (synthesis being performed in the presence of hydrofluoric acid) on the metallic trimers, with 2, 1 or no fluorine ion, respectively, in the neighborhood of the coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Cr3+ considered site.55 Quantitatively, the number of free Cr3+ sites in the activated compound is exactly that expected, considering that one corner over the three octahedra is occupied by one anion.On MIL-101(Cr), this methodology allows identifying these sites as the grafting centres of catalytically active sites.59 Relationship between probe molecules and activity: the case of acetonitrile. Two possible aspects of acidity are generally considered. The first one is the hydrogen bond that can be established between a Brnsted site and the basic probe molecule (for example when carbon monoxide is interacting with acidic zeolites at liquid-nitrogen temperature). The second one is the extent of proton transfer, or more exactly the amount of protonated probe molecule (e.g. pyridine) on the surface of the catalyst at room temperature. These two facets of acidity, however, can not reliably be used for explaining the catalytic activity in acid-catalyzed reactions. The H-bond between a basic molecule and the various acid sites in a solid is strongly influenced by temperature. The linear relation- ship between the strength of a H-bond with CO at 100 K (often used for comparing solid catalysts) and the activation of proton transfer to a hydrocarbon in a chemical reactor at 700 K is far from being established. Acetonitrile has been increasingly used as an infrared probe molecule for solid catalysts, and might well provide an integrated approach of acidity. Both H-bond and protonation can be observed, and it can be used to probe the actual proton transfer in reaction conditions.In the absence of water, heating acetonitrile on an acidic zeolite leads to the reversible protonation of the probe molecule.60 Protonation of acetonitrile on zeolite Brnsted sites at high temperature has been used to build an acidity scale agreeing with catalytic activities in the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons: acidity is determined under conditions near to that of catalytic reactions (high temperature), leading to a more relevant parameter for the prediction of catalytic activity than H-bonds. Acid catalysis involves protonation of the reactant, and a scale built on actual protona- tion, preferably in reaction conditions, is more interesting.The protonation temperature was measured on a series of zeolites, and depends very much on the pore size.61 The nearer the pore size is to the size of the adsorbed molecule, the lower the protonation temperature. For example, in mordenite, two main locations exist for the Brnsted site: in the main channels and in the side pockets. From the point of view of CO at low temperature, a stronger H-bond is created in the main channels, and the stronger site would therefore be in the main channels. However, protonation has only been observed in the small side pockets, where maximum confinement takes place.The measurement of the protonation temperature is a way to know how easy the proton transfer is from the acid catalyst to the basic adsorbed molecule. It is therefore a new spectro- scopic measurement for the acidity of the solid, one that does not only involve the interactions strength between the adsorbed molecule and the surface, but the actual proton transfer, the real nature of acidity. The probe is here not the adsorbed molecule itself, but rather the actual catalytic protonation reaction. The new scale obtained between various zeolites was compared to the activity in catalytic conversion of saturated hydrocarbons at high temperature, a reaction where activity is linked to the acid strength of very strong sites.Contrarily to what was observed with H-bonding of CO or with pyridine protonation at room temperature, the scale of acetonitrile protonation temperature was perfectly linked with the catalytic activity.62 Modification of the basicity of the probe molecule by the acid site. Acetonitrile has also shown that the basicity of the probe is influenced by the adsorption on the solid, especially on zeolites where confinement is important. During molecular dynamics simulations of acetonitrile on mordenites,63 the electric dipole on the molecule was significantly modified in the move from the main channel to the inside of the small lateral cavity. In the purely siliceous mordenite used for the simulation, the molecular dipole of acetonitrile was enhanced from 3 D (in the large channels or in the gas phase) to 4 D in the small cavities. Such enhanced dipole could also imply that the basicity of acetonitrile would be increased by a third on entering the small cavities. Moreover, the probe molecule is locked in the cavity, and does not escape easily. It is thus kept in close distance to the OH group, thus enhancing the probability for the proton transfer (Fig. 5).When the size of the molecule compares with that of the cavity, electron densities in the basic molecule are modified,the basicity of the probe can be enhanced, and the proton transfer can happen more easily. All these parameters show that the basicity of the probe molecule can not be considered without the solid, and that it is always a pair at work.Modification of the acidity of the site by the probe molecule.In some cases, the probe molecule itself modifies the surface acid sites: during comparative study of the Lewis acidity between SiO2B2O3 and alumina by adsorption of pyridine (py), CD3CN (MeCN) and CO, no coordination of carbon monoxide has been observed on silicaboria even at low temperature whereas CO strongly coordinates on alumina.64 Similarly, coordinated pyridine and acetonitrile show a much lower thermal stability on SiO2B2O3 than on Al2O3, Fig. 4 Left: CO adsorption sites of the trimers of chromium octahedra in MIL-100(Cr). Right: n(CO) bands of CO adsorbed on MIL-100(Cr).55 Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M 4934 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 indicating that silicaboria presents much weaker Lewis-acid sites than g-Al2O3. On the other hand, coordinated pyridine and acetonitrile species show that infrared frequency shifts (n8a, n19b and n(CN), respectively) are larger on B2O3SiO2 than on Al2O3, suggesting that charge transfer from these probe molecules is more important on the B3+ than on the Al3+ Lewis acid (Fig. 6). DFT calculations of the interaction of these probe molecules with models representing Al3+ and B3+ Lewis-acid sites adequately reproduce these experimental observations (Fig. 7). The weakness of the B3+ Lewis-acid sites is ascribed to the p-character of BO bonds, which disfavours the conversion of boron from a trigonal planar conformation to a tetrahedral conformation upon adsorption of probe molecules and decreases the adsorption energy of pyridine and acetonitrile despite a strong charge transfer.The absence of interaction noted during the adsorption of CO on SiO2B2O3 has been explained by its basicity, not strong enough to compensate for the energy required for the conformational change of the B3+ Lewis-acid centre.Transformation LewisBrnsted sites. Brnsted acidity can be generated by water on the surface of crystalline or amorphous solids. On metal oxides, it is well known that water can transform Lewis into Brnsted acidity by dissociative water adsorption on the Md+Od acidbase pairs, with the con- sequent creation of MOH acidic groups. On aluminium fluorides, water addition transforms Lewis-acid sites into Brnsted sites on activated compounds.65 Due to the strong Lewis acidity, water is strongly coordinated on fluorides and generates strong Brnsted sites, as evidenced by CO adsorp- tion. The absence of sufficiently strong basic sites on fluorides,as shown by an unpublished study of propyne adsorption,inhibits dissociative adsorption of water on such materials.The consequences of the adsorption of protic molecules (water and alcohols) on the acidity of MOFs, have been well identified by IR spectroscopy:55,58 adsorption of water on activated MIL-100(Cr) leads to the formation of coordinated species well characterized by two narrow n(OH) bands at about 3700 and 3580 cm1. CO adsorption at 100 K shows that coordinated water induces the creation of Brnsted-acid sites with a strength close to that reported in the case of phosphated silica. The successive addition of CO molecules on hydrated MIL-100(Cr) shows that each coordinated water molecules creates two Brnsted-acid sites (see Scheme 1).This LewisBrnsted acid conversion was used to modulate the strength of the created Brnsted-acid sites according to the Fig. 5 Molecular dynamic simulation of acetonitrile in a purely siliceous mordenite.

Their strength is directly related to the nature of the grafted molecules and can reach that of the zeolitic Brnsted- acid sites when fluorinated alcohols are used (see Fig. 8).58 Basic sites. Heterogeneous catalysis using basic solids has been much less studied than acidic catalysis. It seems even that a concern exists about the definition of basicity itself. It may be useful to recall here that, in spite of the common use, there is not a physical difference between the so-called Brnsted and Lewis basicity, because for both it is due to electrons on oxygen atoms. In fact, for Brnsted, an acid site is a proton donor (i.e. an hydroxyl on heterogeneous catalysts), whereas Fig. 7 Evolution of the total interaction energy (DEtot, ), deformation energy of the Lewis-acid center (DEdef(A),   ), deformation energy of the probe molecule (DEdef, --), and interaction energies of the probe with the Lewis center at their geometry in the complex (DEint, ---) for six acidbase complexes as a function of the ML distance (M = B or Al; L = C or N).64 The deformation energy is the difference between the energies of the isolated species at their equilibrium geometries and the energy of the isolated species at their geometry in the complex.Scheme 1 Interaction of CO with coordinated water molecules in MIL-100(Cr).58 Reproduced by permission of the American Chemical Society.Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M 4936 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 for Lewis it is an electron pair acceptor (i.e. a cation); but looking at basicity definitions, in the sense of Brnsted a basic site is a proton acceptor, while for Lewis it is an electron pair donor, therefore an oxygen site in both cases, or an halogen atom for halogen based catalysts. Some simple concepts addressing this problem have also been mentioned by Zecchina et al.66 Concerning the difficulties in studying surface basicity, we might explain it with the fact that FT-IR is a technique sensitive to molecular bonds: in the case of acidity, when using a probe molecule to characterize Lewis sites, the molecular deformations of the molecule induced by the cationic polarizing effect are measured. In the case of a basic site, the surface is donating electrons and the back-donation effect on a molecule is a more complicated phenomenon to quantify. When studying proton donation or acceptance, the spectra are always com- plicated by broad and badly resolved features. From a general point of view, anyway, protonic molecules seem particularly adapted for probing basic sites, taking into account the basicity definition itself (and impacting them only by weak interactions).As an acid site is always associated to its conjugated basic site, reviews dealing with characterization of acidity by infrared also report interesting data about basicity (see for example ref. 41) and even describe some typical probe molecule inter- actions: CH-acids such as chloroform (Cl3CH(D)), acetylene (C2H2) and methylacetylene (CH3C2H) are shown to be potentially suitable probe molecules for basic properties using the H-bonding method.67 All three molecules undergo Oz2  HC hydrogen bonding and the induced red-shift of the CH stretching frequency permits a ranking of the base strength of a given series of materials. Many other probe molecules were tested for the specific study of the surface basicity of divided metal oxides, and Lavalley reviewed some years ago the infrared spectrometric studies of the surface basicity of metal oxides and zeolites using adsorbed probe molecules.4 Results obtained from carbon monoxide (CO),carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), pyrrole (C4H5N),chloroform (CHCl3), acetonitrile (CH3CN), alkanes, thiols,boric acid tri-Me-ether,ammonia
(NH3),
and pyridine (C5H5N) were discussed in that well cited review. As we already noticed in the case of the acidity study, the author reminds us that no probe can be used universally. CO2 for weakly basic metal oxides and for basic OH groups, CO for the characterization of highly basic structural defects on metal oxides activated at high temperature and pyrrole in the case of alkaline zeolites, appear to be quite suitable probes. Moreover,both NH3 and pyridine (generally used as probes for the measure of the acidity of catalysts) are also described to adsorb on basic oxides via dissociative chemisorption. In this respect we should stress that a strongly interacting probe (such as CO2 and NO2, for example) highly modifies the surface behaviour, often leading to false interpretations on the strength of the basic site. Moreover, a probe which dissociates is an unfriendly tool for site concentration characterisation when using volumetric methods. Again, a non-dissociating,weakly interacting protonic probe would appear as a most adapted tool for surface basic site characterization.
A pioneering review on the basic properties of zeolites was proposed by Barthomeuf.68 More recently, NO2 disproportio- nation on alkaline zeolites was used to generate nitrosonium (NO+) and nitrate ions whose infrared vibrations are shown to be very sensitive to the cation chemical hardness and to the basicity of zeolitic oxygen atoms.69 Recently, Michalska et al.70 have pointed out that propyne is an excellent probe for the study of oxygen basicity. Addi- tionally, they have verified that probe dissociation does not depend on the site strength, but can be due to the presence of Lewis-acid sites coupled with the basic ones: the formation of the hydrogen bond weakens the bond between RC and H.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4937 In the presence of an acid site, which can host the CH3CRC moiety, the surface protonation is therefore easily achieved.
Therefore, propyne dissociation is a good probe for the presence of acidbase pairs on a surface.70 Basicity case study. Among the catalysts having basic properties, ceria is probably the most common owing to its properties in the domains of oxidation and hydrogen produc- tion. It is the base material for car exhaust control devices,notably for Three Way Catalyst (TWC) applications. For these reasons an extensive characterisation of its properties has been undertaken for at least two decades. Pyrrole adsorp- tion on CeO2 leads to dissociative adsorption characterized by stretching ring vibrations at 1444 and 1367 cm1 typical of pyrrolate ions and n(OH) vibration at 3628 cm1 typical of surface hydroxyls formed upon proton transfer.71 This complete dissociation of C4H5N is indicative of the high basicity of CeO2 surface O2 ions but does not allow an investigation of its variation upon reducing ceria. CO2 was further adsorbed as it acts as a Lewis acid toward either O2 surface ions (with the production of carbonates) or residual basic OH surface species (with the production of hydrogen carbonates (HC)). The study extended to CeZr mixed oxides72 indicates that hydrogen-carbonates (indicative for basic OH groups) are mainly observed for rich ceria compounds and that the intensity of carbonate species is directly proportional to the cerium content, as expected according to the basic properties of this element. Identification of the spectral features typical of each species arising from CO2 adsorption was clarified by studying the splitting of the n3 band of carbonates and their thermal stability.
Nowadays, basicity is becoming a more and more important parameter, and basic materials are involved in numerous industrial processes, such as fine chemical production via green chemistry routes (replacing homogeneous by heterogeneous procedures, for example in esterification reactions in the absence of any solvent), or environmental catalysis. One of the most investigated methods for nitrogen oxide removal is NOx-trapping. In this process, NOx are stored and concen- trated in highly basic compounds, before being submitted to a reduction. The materials used in this respect are typically barium,alkaline metals,alkaline-earths and rare earth oxides.73 In such a case CO2 and NO2 are the most adopted probe molecules, giving rise to carbonates and nitrates,respectively. The storing materials are obviously submitted to severe surface and bulk restructuration, but in the same way they will be under service, exposed to the reacting lean and reach flows, containing NOx and high concentrations of CO2.
General indications on nitrate characterization and their coordination on a number of solids can be found in the excellent review by Hadjiivanov.37 A comparative study of barium and potassium based formulation74 indicated upon NO2 adsorption the formation of both ionic and covalent-like
NO3
species over PtRh/Ba/Al2O3, whereas only very stable ionic potassium nitrates (sharp peak at 1373 cm1) were detected over Pt/K/Mn/CeAl2O3. This is due to the higher basicity of the potassium sites which furthermore enlarges the adsorbing temperature window and delays the nitrate release during the rich step impeaching NO sudden outlet.
A comparison of the latter composition with a great number of other NSR catalysts was reported in ref. 75, where the exact chemistry of nitrite and nitrate formation was investigated,and their coordination on specific structural sites of the oxide determined thanks to the parallel use of TEM analyses.
Another interesting example is the synthesis of phyto- sterol esters from transesterification of a fatty methyl ester (dodecanoate) with b-sitosterol carried out in the presence of basic solid catalysts, such as lanthanum oxides.76 The acidbase properties of La2O3 were characterized by IR spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of residual unidentate,bidentate, polydentate, and mineral carbonate species inside all of the solids even after activation, suggesting different basic and catalytic characteristics of the samples. The carbonate strengths were determined by propyne adsorption, using the shift of the n(CRC) stretching mode for the adsorbed species:the lower the position of that vibration, the greater the basicity of the corresponding site. A ranking of the basic strength of the surface carbonates species of the lanthanum oxycarbonate samples was thus possible and it was correlated to the catalytic activity: the lower the basicity of carbonates, the higher the phytosterol ester yield.
Moreover,a thorough spectral characterization of KBr-diluted samples indicated that the higher the intensity of unidentate carbonate bands (1499 and 1382 cm1), the higher the sterol ester yield, suggesting those moieties of medium basic strength play a central role in the catalytic mechanism.
It was shown in our laboratory that COS hydrolysis77 and CS2 hydrolysis78 could be used as test-reactions for metal oxide hydroxyl basicity. However, the use of IR spectroscopy should add value to this form of characterisation: adsorption of CS2 on a series of metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO and CeO2) gave rise to a specific interaction with O2 sites, leading to the formation of xanthate (COS2)2 species characterized by bands in the 12001000 cm1 range whose intensities correlate well with the relative basicity of the analyzed oxides.
Co-adsorption experiments of CS2 with either CO2 or pyridine showed that its adsorption sites are mainly those giving rise to bidentate carbonates, showing that this new probe is more specific than CO2. Moreover, the transformation of xanthate into carbonate species at low temperature could account also for the surface oxygen mobility.79 Metallic and redox sites. Transition metal oxides, rare-earth oxides and various metal complexes deposited on their surface are typical catalytic phases leading to redox properties. For each of these phases, complementary tools exist for an appro- priate characterization of the metal coordination number,oxidation state or nuclearity. Among all the techniques, IR provides information by characterizing the characteristic vibrations of intrinsic (hydroxyls) or extrinsic (methanol, CO, . . .) probes.
We have already discussed the principles of the use of probe molecules for the characterisation of surface species in the section concerning probe molecule use. CO and NO can provide highly valuable information on the supported metal dispersion and coordination, as well as on the oxidation degree of such moieties. Typical examples can be found in the works of Binet8083 and Bazin.84,85 This methodology appears Downloaded by University of Toronto on 21 November 2012 Published on 29 October 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B919543M 4938 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 particularly adapted to the case of redox supports, where the alternative hydrogen chemisorption will lead to imprecise results. Another positive point for the use of such probes is their small size, allowing site accessibility even in small cavities. Moreover, the fair interaction energy between the probe and the site is a guarantee for a minor perturbation of the surface state upon interaction. A useful volumetric/ spectroscopic
CO
adsorption combined method allows metal dispersion calculation in a simple and reliable way, by integrating the bands relative to CO adsorption on the metal sites vs. the molar amount of the introduced probe, as shown in Fig. 9.85,86 In such a way CO adsorption mode, sites and quantity are continuously monitored by IR spectra upon calibrated doses introduction.
Additionally, carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide adsorption can provide very useful information on the coordi- nation mode of such molecules (of primary importance for environmental issues) and on the complexes formed with the metal particles, potential sites for pollutant abatement.
For example, it was found that the adsorption of CO on a non- reduced Pt/TiO2 sample reveals the existence of Pt3+ and Pt2+ cations as well as some amount of metallic platinum. However, Pt4+ species are also present on the sample but, being coordinatively saturated, cannot adsorb CO, while NO forms nitrosyl species with bare Pt2+ and Pt0 sites, but it is not coordinated to Pt3+ ions. Therefore, it appears that NO is a more sensitive probe than CO for testing the state of Pt2+ cations. Moreover it must be underlined that probe adsorption is not totally innocent: adsorbed CO slowly reduces the platinum cations, whereas NO oxidizes metallic platinum even at ambient temperature.87 Similar results were found on Rh-ZSM-5, where a new kind of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls was discovered. The shift of the n(CO) vibration allowed under- standing Rh position in the porous structure, its oxidation state and the capacity to host different chemical species having different stability, especially in the presence of water. These data are fundamental for understanding the mechanism of different catalytic reactions.88 According to this methodology, CO and NO adsorption on zeolithe supported Rh nano- particles containing different promoter elements permitted to both characterise the effect of the additive and the catalytic activity of the noble metal.89 Many studies were carried out on copper oxidation state,due to its importance when inserted in ZSM-5 zeolites for NO reduction. Its characteristic carbonyl band at 2158 cm1 provides quantitative results on integrating its molar extinc- tion coefficient.90 Hadjiivanov et al.91 described the water effect (which is always present during deNOx real conditions) and reported that bands at 2158 and 2134 cm1 may charac- terize CO bound to dry and wet Cu+ centres, respectively,the latter being also possibly assigned to a CuO-like phase.
However a comparative study using both Cu-ZSM-5 and CuO/Al2O3 allowed Praliaud et al. to propose the n(CO) at 21232133 cm1 to be due to non-isolated Cu+ species (Cu+ surrounded by Cu2+ ions) arising from the partial reduction of bulk CuO. Whereas, the band at 21522157 cm1 would characterize isolated Cu+ ions, which are described to be responsible for the high activity in NO reduction into N2.92 Concerning NO, its adsorption even at room temperature may lead to Cu+ oxidation to Cu2+ and therefore its use for the determination of copper oxidation state distribution is rather problematical.
However the formation of Cu+ mono- and dinitrosyls is observable for high temperature (770 K) Cu-ZSM-5 activated under vacuum and Datka et al.93 even reported the possible existence of two distinct Cu+NO species at 1812 and 1825 cm1, associated to two distinct Cu+ sites differing in the density of oxygen packing. A discussion around Cu+ carbonyls can be also found in the Strauss94,95 and Zecchina96 reports. Further detailing the characterization of Cu+ by NO, it has been shown that the zeolitic structure also influences the symmetry of the dinitrosyl species and for a CuMOR sample the Cu+NO (1813 cm1) transformation into Cu+(NO)2 leads to different spectral feature depending on the Cu+ location: a doublet with ns and nas at 1828 and 1730 cm1 in the main channels and another doublet with ns and nas at 1870 and 1785 cm1 in the constrained side-pockets.97 The use of both probes can also be interesting when each one is sensitive to an oxidation state of an element, as in the case of copper, probed by NO in the Cu2+ state, whereas CO adsorp- tion would be more specific to the Cu+ state (since CO com- plexes with Cu2+ are only stable at very low temperature).98 Another example concerns the adsorption of both CO and NO as informative for the determination of the oxidation state of vanadium on vanadiatitania catalysts. Although the carbonyl bands for V4+CO, V3+CO and Ti4+CO species almost coincide,99 the fact that NO forms dinitrosyls with Vn+ but not with Ti4+ allows the effective use of NO as a probe molecule.100 Iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts were also studied for their potential application in deNOx by hydrocarbons. Interesting results identifying different Fe2+ species as active sites for NOx SCR with propene can be found in ref. 101 and 102. Fe3+ characterization in the Y structure was also previously studied Fig. 9 Integrated intensity of the n(CO) bands bound to platinum as a function of introduced CO amount (reproduced from ref. 85). The abscissa of the line intersection corresponds to a CO monolayer on the exposed metal surface. This allows calculating the number of accessible Pt atoms, i.e. the metal dispersion.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49284950 4939 using CO adsorption,103 even if IR spectroscopy of probe molecules is more suitable for characterization of Fe2+ than Fe3+ cations. More recently, we tried to resolve this inter- pretation conflict present in the specialized literature, reporting NO adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy to charac- terize iron cations in Fe-ferrierite.104 Different iron sites forming mononitrosyl species were identified. The comple- mentary use of Mo ssbauer spectroscopy enabled us to deter- mine that the iron oxidation state is essentially +2. For low Fe loading (by ion exchange), the main fraction of Fe2+ cations is suggested to be located in highly accessible positions of the ferrierite, where ionic exchange takes place in the easiest way. When the amount of Fe is increased, a second site in a less accessible position is detected. When an oxidative pretreatment is applied, only the iron cations in the confined positions lead to the formation of Fe3+OH species. More- over, NO appears to be able to form polynitrosyl species with these confined Fe2+ cations. It thus appears that both the oxidation and the coordination states of confined Fe2+ may change easily, which makes them excellent candidates for active redox sites.104 Combining CO and NO as molecular probes, we were able to go into very fine detail for site characterisation in Fe-FER. It was ascertained that type I sites are the most populated and the Fe2+ ions located in the so-called G-positions are the most symmetric ones. Their unique geometry allows two guest molecules approaching the site from different cages, resulting in the formation of monocarbonyls (2195 cm1), converted then, at low tempera- tures, into dicarbonyls (2188 cm1). Type I Fe2+ cations are hardly sensitive to oxidizing treatment and show little tendency to yield Fe3+ cations. Type II sites are less populated and less symmetric: Fe2+ ions in these B-positions form, with CO,monocarbonyls (2189 cm1) and, with NO, mononitrosyls (1880 cm1) practically coinciding in wavenumber with the nitrosyls formed with type I Fe2+ ions. These cations are sensitive to oxidizing treatment and are easily oxidized to Fe3+ ions most probably associated to the formation of a-oxygen species. When the iron concentration in the samples increases, a third site (F-site) is occupied. Iron ions in this position change easily and reversibly their oxidation state from Fe2+ to Fe3+ thus forming Fe3+OH or Fe3+O species.
When in the Fe2+ state, iron ions form the most stable carbonyl species (2196 cm1) which can be converted, at low temperature, into di- (B2188 cm1) and tricarbonyls (B2180 cm1). With NO these Fe2+ ions form nitrosyls absorbing at 1895 cm1. With time, in NO atmosphere, the Fe2+ cations are displaced from their original positions in order to form tetranitrosyl species.105 The specific structure of MOF compounds gives particular adsorption, separation and catalytic properties to these materials. For example, the controlled reduction of a large-pore iron(III) trimesate with unsaturated iron sites, MIL-100(Fe),strongly increases the strength of interaction with unsaturated gas molecules, such as propylene and CO, that have either a double or triple bond. Therefore, this property leads to a dramatic improvement of not only preferential gas sorption but also separation performance for the investigated hybrid compound: it could be used for the removal of CO impurity to protect the deactivation of Pt electrodes in low temperature fuel cells, for example, or the removal of CO from CO2-rich mixtures arising from the production of hydrogen from biomass. The use of mixed-valent MIL-100(Fe) may be also considered for further applications involving the selective separation or purification of olefins and acetylenes from hydrocarbon mixtures. The reducibility of MIL-100(Fe) to form FeII CUS has been unambiguously shown by in situ IR spectroscopic analysis using CO as a probe, which also allowed to quantify the concentration of Fe2+/Fe3+ sites as a function of the activation treatment (see Scheme 2 and Fig. 10). Moreover it provided evidences that unsaturated sites can be created not only through the removal of water but also to a much lesser extent from the departure of other Scheme 2 Representations of MIL-100(Fe): (a) one unit cell, (b) two types of mesoporous cages shown as polyhedra, (c) formation of FeIII CUS and FeII CUS in an octahedral iron trimer of MIL-100(Fe) by dehydration and partial reduction from the departure of anionic ligands (X = F or OH) (from ref. 106).

This arises from the ability of the Ce cation oxidation number in ceria and ceria-zirconia to easily change between 3+ and 4+. The surface state (reduced or oxidized) and composition (ratio between cerium and zirconium cations) is available using methanol (CH3OH) adsorption.107 Its dissocia- tion leads to cation coordinated methoxy and hydroxyl formation. Both the n(CO) wavenumbers associated to methoxy species108,109 and the n(OH) associated to surface hydroxyls110 depend on the cerium oxidation state. The Ce4+/Ce3+ surface ratio is thus available from the quantitative study of the corresponding methoxy intensities. Fig. 11 shows the con- secutive adsorption of oxygen (O2) calibrated doses after methanol dissociation over pre-reduced ceriumzirconium mixed oxide which enable the determination of the oxygen storage capacity of the sample.
Moreover, the methoxy species is very sensitive to the local coordination site and it allows discriminating between the different cations on a surface. Concerning ceriazirconia solid solutions, for example, methoxys on Ce4+ and Zr4+ surface sites present specific IR fingerprints. Therefore, the surface cationic composition can easily been obtained upon methanol adsorption at room temperature.25 Rare-earth compounds also present electronic transitions, arising for ions in internal structural defects; for ceria, at temperatures above 523 K a new band appears at 2120 cm1 and is attributed to the 2F5/2 - 2F7/2 electronic transition of Ce3+, thus indicating the beginning of bulk oxide reduction.111 Accessibility of sites. To be active in a catalytic reaction, a surface site must be accessible to reactants and products.
Isotope labelling is here again a very useful tool. Deutera- tion of the surface OH groups is only possible if they are accessible to the deuterated molecule used for the exchange. In silica, for example, internal silanol groups are distinguished from external ones based on accessibility to deuterated water molecules.112 An accessibility index (ACI) was derived from infrared spectroscopy of substituted alkylpyridines with different sizes (pyridine: 0.57 nm, 2,6-lutidine: 0.67 nm, collidine: 0.74 nm) over hierarchical ZSM-5 crystals. The samples were prepared by selective silicon extraction of a parent commercial sample in alkaline medium (desilication) and contained different degrees of intracrystalline mesoporosity. The enhanced accessibility of acid sites in the hierarchical zeolites was shown. A relatively bulky molecule such as collidine, which probes practically no acid sites of the parent medium-pore MFI structure, can access up to 40% of the Brnsted sites in the mesoporous sample.
The ACI is a powerful tool to standardize acid site accessibility in zeolites and can be used to rank the effectiveness of synthetic strategies towards hierarchical zeolites (mesoporous crystals, nanocrystals, and composites).113 Time resolved studies of probe molecules: 2D-pressure jump spectroscopy. Time-resolved IR spectroscopy can be used in probe molecule studies. Microsecond infrared spectroscopy can be used to monitor adsorbed probe molecules after a pressure jump on the surface of a porous catalyst. The analysis of the time behavior of the adsorbed molecule can be obtained by a Fourier Transform of the IR spectra over time. A 2D map is obtained, showing frequency response vs. IR spectra for the adsorbed probe molecule on the catalyst.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
