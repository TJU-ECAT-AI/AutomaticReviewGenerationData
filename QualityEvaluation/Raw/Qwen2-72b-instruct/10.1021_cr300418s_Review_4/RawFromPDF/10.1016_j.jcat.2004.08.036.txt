Abstract
K-doped Mo–V–Sb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by
hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of
adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593–693 K temperature range. The undoped MoVSbO
catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped
catalysts. No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each
case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis. However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to
XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped
catalysts. The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acid–base properties of the
catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brønsted) acid sites. In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity
is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed.

1. Introduction
There is an increasing interest in the development of a
process for direct oxidation of propane to acrylic acid as
an alternative to the two-step conventional industrial process
based on the propylene feedstock, which represents approx-
imately 90% of the 1.84 × 106 tons/year of the total capac-
ity of acrylic acid production plants [1,2]. Although a large
number of catalytic systems have been studied, only few cat-
alysts seem to be relatively active and selective [3,4]. This
is the case of undoped and Me-doped V–P–O oxides [5–7],
Ni–Mo–Te–P–O oxides [8,9], and metal and/or pyridine ex-
changed molybdovanadophosphoric acid [1–14].

MoVNbTe(Sb) catalysts have been recently proposed as
active and selective in the oxidation of propane to acrylic
acid [15–24], but the selectivities achieved on Sb-containing
catalysts [19–23] are generally lower than those obtained on
Te-containing catalysts [15–18]. Despite their practical in-
terest, few fundamental studies on the nature and catalytic
behavior of MoVSb-based catalysts have been published
[20–23]. Although some factors seem to have an important
inﬂuence on the selectivity to acrylic acid, such as the cat-
alyst calcination conditions [20,21] or the incorporation of
water in the feed [22], relatively low selectivities to acrylic
acid have been reported.
Characterization results published on MoVSbO [23] and
MoVSbNbO [20,21] catalysts suggest the presence of sev-
eral crystalline phases depending on the chemical compo-
sition, the catalyst preparation procedure, and the calcina-

tion conditions. Sb4Mo10O30 and Sb2Mo10O31 in addition
to Mo5−x(V/Nb)xO14 were proposed to be present on sam-
ples prepared by a slurry method and heat-treated at 873 K
in N2 and activated in He or in O2/He mixtures (20% of
O2), although some changes in the DRX were observed de-
pending on the activation procedure [20,21]. (Sb2O)M6O18
and (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V) were proposed,
however, in MoVSbO catalysts prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis and activated in air at 643 K for 20 min followed
by a second heat treatment, in pure nitrogen, at 873 K for
2 h [26]. Nevertheless, the similarities of the XRD pat-
terns of the oxides involved and the complexity of the sys-
tems render difﬁcult an unambiguous interpretation of the
diffraction data, and to get additional information, which
may help to elucidate the crystallographic phases, present,
by using other characterization techniques. In this sense,
one of the differences among these crystalline phases is
the Sb oxidation state, which is Sb3+ in Sb4Mo10O30 and
Sb2Mo10O31 [20,25] and Sb3+/Sb5+ in (Sb2O)M6O18 and
(SbO)2M20O56 [26].
MoVSbO catalysts, prepared by hydrothermal synthe-
sis, have also been studied in the partial oxidation of
propane [23]. They present a selectivity to acrylic acid (ca.
6%) lower than that obtained on Te-based catalysts [16,23,
24], although their catalytic performance has partially been
enhanced by grinding the catalyst precursor before the calci-
nation step. However, selectivities to acrylic acid lower than
20% have been reported [23].
Recently, it has been shown that the selectivity to acrylic
acid obtained during the selective oxidation of propane on
MoVSbO catalysts can be improved by the incorporation of
potassium on the catalyst surface [27]. This higher produc-
tion of acrylic acid could be related to the modiﬁcations of
the nature and number of acid sites on the catalyst surface
after the incorporation of potassium. However, the role of
each element and the nature of the crystalline phases are still
unclear.
In this paper we will present the characterization and cat-
alytic behavior of undoped and K-doped MoVSbO, in which
the incorporation of potassium has a promoter effect on the
catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of propane
to acrylic acid. The characterization results show no changes
in the bulk of the catalysts after the incorporation of potas-
sium, suggesting that the higher selectivity to acrylic acid
observed on K-doped catalysts could be mainly related to the
modiﬁcation of both the number and the nature of acid sites
rather than changes in the oxidation state of the Sb cations
on the catalyst surface.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A Mo–V–Sb mixed metal oxide catalyst was prepared
by a hydrothermal method, using vanadyl sulfate, anti-
mony sulfate, ammonium heptamolybdate, and water with
a Mo/V/Sb atomic ratio of 1/0.18/0.15. The gel was au-
toclaved in Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel autoclave at 448 K
for 48 h. The resulting precursor was ﬁltered, washed, dried
at 353 K for 16 h, and heat-treated at 873 K for 2 h in N2
stream. It will be called the MVS sample.
K-doped Mo–V–Sb mixed metal oxide catalysts (with
K/Mo atomic ratios from 0.002 to 0.02) have been pre-
pared by impregnation of the MVS sample with aqueous
solutions of potassium nitrate. The samples were then ro-
tavapored at 323 K and 14 kPa. The resulting powders were
dried overnight at 373 K and ﬁnally heat-treated at 773 K
for 1 h in a N2 stream. The samples will be named MVSK-n
(n = 1 to 4); their main characteristics are shown in Table 1.
For comparative purpose, a portion of the MVS precursor
was ﬁrst calcined in air at 553 K (2 h) and then heat-treated
at 873 K (2 h) in N2. This sample will be referred to as MVS-
A-N.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were collected using
a Philips X’Pert diffractometer equipped with a graphite
monochromator, operating at 40 kV and 45 mA and employ-
ing nickel-ﬁltered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX micro-
analyses were performed on a JEOL JSM 6300 LINK ISIS
instrument. The quantitative EDX analysis was performed
using an Oxford LINK ISIS System with the SEMQUANT
program, which introduces the ZAF correction.
Infrared spectra of the samples diluted in KBr (20 mg of
the sample mixed with 100 mg of dry KBr and pressed into
a disk) were obtained with a Nicolet 710 FTIR spectrometer.
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) were
recorded with a Bruker ER-200D spectrometer working
in the X-band and calibrated with a DPPH standard (g =
2.0036). Quantitative analysis was carried out by double
integration of the EPR spectra and comparison with a cop-
per sulfate (CuSO4 ·5H2O) standard. Computer simulations
were employed to determine experimental parameters or to
quantify contributions of overlapping signals. Portions of
ca. 40 mg of sample were introduced inside an EPR quartz
probe cell and subjected (under conventional high vacuum
conditions) to extensive room temperature outgassing prior
to recording their spectra.
Photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG-
Escalab-210 Spectrometer using AlKα radiation (AlKα =
1486 eV) operated at 12 kV and 20 mA. The spectrome-
ter’s hemispherical analyzer was set to 50 eV constant pass
energy. The samples were previously outgassed at 373 K
for 2 h in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer and
subsequently transferred to the analysis chamber where the
pressure during spectra acquisition was 5 × 10−10 Torr. The
binding energy (BE) data were referenced to C1s (BE =
284.5 eV) from surface contamination. Atomic ratios of
the elements were calculated from the relative peak areas

of the respective core-level lines using the Wagner sensi-
tivity factors [28]. The inﬂuence of the Kα3,4 satellite of
the O1s line has been taken into account for the integration
of the V2p3/2 core-level line. Thus, the satellite subtrac-
tion (intensity ratios I/I0 and energies distances E, be-
tween main line and satellite) has been adjusted by using
a reference material without vanadium in order to obtain a
smooth background baseline, as indicated in Ref. [29]. By
optimising the above mentioned parameters, the values ob-
tained for the satellite subtraction are Kα3: I/I0 = 0.06225,
E = 9.8 eV; and Kα4: I/I0 = 0.030, E = 11.8 eV.
Determination of the O1s peak area is calculated after sub-
traction of the Sb3d5/2 peak area (assuming a 3:2 peak ra-
tio of the 3d5/2:3d3/2 doublets). Data analysis procedures
involve smoothing, a Shirley background subtraction, and
curve ﬁtting using mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian functions by
a least-squares method.
Sb LI edge XANES spectra were acquired at room tem-
perature at the line D42, XAS 13 beamline, at the LURE
Synchrotron Radiation facility (Orsay, Paris) using a double
crystal Si (311) monochromator, detuned until 50%. Detec-
tion was made in the transmission mode by using two ion
chambers with air ﬁlled gas. Three scans were collected
for every spectra in the range 4650–4680 eV, with varying
energy steps in three regions: 0.5 eV/s between 4650 and
4680 eV, 0.2 eV/s in the 4680–4735 eV region, and 0.4 eV/s
in the range 4735–4780 eV. Linear background absorption
was subtracted to the entire spectra, which was then normal-
ized at approximately 50 eV above the absorption edge. The
spectrum of FeSbO4 was recorded as a reference for the po-
sition of the Sb5+ cation, with the absorption maximum at
4707.5 eV.
Infrared spectra of adsorbed ammonia were obtained in a
Bio-Rad Fis-4017 spectrophotometer.Wafers of 10 mg cm−2,
mounted in a Pyrex vacuum cell ﬁtted with KRS-5 windows,
were degassed at 473 K for 2 h and then cooled at room tem-
perature. Ammonia was ﬁrst admitted at room temperature,
degassed for 1 h, and ﬁnally desorbed at 298–373 K.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic experiments were carried out in a ﬁxed-
bed quartz tubular reactor (i.d. 20 mm, length 400 mm),
working at atmospheric pressure [24]. Catalyst samples
(0.3–0.5 mm particle size) were introduced in the re-
actor and diluted with 2–4 g of silicon carbide (0.5–
0.75 mm particle size) in order to keep a constant volume
in the catalyst bed. The feed consisted of a mixture of
C3H8/O2/H2O/He or C3H6/O2/H2O/He molar ratio of
4/8/30/58 or 4/9/30/57, respectively. Experiments were
carried out in the 613–673 K temperature interval in order to
achieve the highest selectivity to partial oxidation products.
Reactants and reaction products were analyzed by on-line
gas chromatography [16]. Blank runs showed that the homo-
geneous reaction could be neglected under the experimental
conditions used in this work.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
A slight decrease of the surface area is observed upon
the incorporation of potassium in the MoVSbO catalyst (Ta-
ble 1), indicating that neither the incorporation of potassium
by impregnation nor a second heat-treatment in N2 at 773 K
for 1 h have a strong inﬂuence on the speciﬁc surface area of
MoVSb-based catalysts.
The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is
shown in Fig. 1a. The appearance of peaks at 2θ = 22.3,
25.8, 28.3, 36.3, 45.0, and 50.0◦can be attributed to the
presence of a Sb3+-containing compound like Sb4Mo10O30

[JCPDS, 33-0104] [20,21], although the formation of (Sb2-
O)M6O19 (with M = Mo and V), a Sb5+/Sb3+-containing
crystalline phase [26] cannot be ruled out. Besides this,
peaks at 2θ = 6.6, 7.8, 8.9, 22.3, 26.3, 26.7, 27.3, and 29.3◦
could be related to the presence of a Sb3+-containing com-
pound like Sb2Mo10O31 [JCPDS: 33-105] [20,21], although
the formation of (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V),
a Sb5+/Sb3+-containing phase [26], (V0.07Mo0.93)5O14
[JCPDS: 31-1437] should also be considered. No sig-
niﬁcant differences are appreciated in the XRD patterns
when comparing undoped and K-doped MoVSbO sam-
ples (Fig. 1b), although changes in the proportion between
Sb2Mo10O31/Sb4Mo10O30 or the presence of (SbO)2M20-
O56/(Sb2O)M6O18 cannot be detected by XRD. Further-
more, additional peaks at 2θ = 12.9, 25.4, 27.2, and 38.9◦
which can be due to the formation, as minor phases, of un-
doped or metal-doped MoO3 [JCPDS: 5-508] are present
in both the K-free and the K-doped samples. The intensity
of these peaks is particularly high in the MVS-A-N sample
(Fig. 1c). This suggests that, in this case, a partial oxidation
of the catalyst is produced during the calcination in air at
553 K.
The morphology of the catalysts has been studied by
scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive
analysis (EDX). The results obtained are collected in Ta-
ble 1. The SEM image of the catalysts (not reported) shows

the presence of agglomerates containing small slabs and rods
of less than 5 µm in diameter. This morphology is similar to
those previously observed in Te- [23,24] or Sb-based [23]
catalysts prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. The global
chemical composition obtained by EDX analysis is in fair
agreement with those obtained by AAS (Table 1). Never-
theless, the SEM-EDX analysis evidences the presence of
local inhomogeneities in the composition of the particles,
with Sb-depleted zones, in some cases associated with lower
V concentrations (Table 1). In every case, the composition
of the crystals seems to be consistent with the crystalline
phases observed by XRD.
Fig. 2 shows the IR spectra of undoped and K-doped
catalysts. In agreement with the XRD results, the introduc-
tion of K in the Mo–V–Sb catalyst does not produce strong
changes in the bulk of the catalyst, as no signiﬁcant differ-
ences are found in the positions of the bands between sam-
ples with variable K content. The modiﬁcations observed in
the overall or relative intensities of a determinate group of
bands must rather be associated with K incorporation at sur-
face positions. The bands at 868, 800, 714, and 652 cm−1
can be attributed to antisymmetric vibrations of Mo–O–Me
(Me = Mo, Sb) bridging bonds [20,24,30]. The bands at ca.
925, 600, and 454 cm−1 are probably related to V=O groups
and V–O–Me bonds (Me = Mo, V) [20,24,29] and/or to the
presence of Sb2Mo10O31 [20]. A shoulder at 990 cm−1 in-
dicates the presence of Mo=O cis-dioxo groups of MoO3
[30], which contribute to the band at 868 cm−1 too.
EPR spectra recorded at 77 K consist in all cases es-
sentially in the overlapping of two signals. An example of
spectrum deconvolution is shown in Fig. 3 for the MVS
sample. All spectra basically consist in the overlapping of
a major broad symmetric signal A1 at ⟨g⟩= 1.93 with

Hpp ≈1000 G and a minor axial one at g⊥= 1.96 and
g∥= 1.90, signal A2, which is narrower than the former
(average width ≈225 G). It must be noted that signal A1
could present certain anisotropy, difﬁcult to be resolved as
a consequence of its considerable width. Parameters of sig-
nals A1 and A2 are consistent with the presence of Mo5+
cations [16,31]; though their large linewidth does not discard
the contribution of other possible paramagnetic cations (like
V4+), which could participate into magnetically coupled
phases. This is particularly true for the major broader signal
A1, for which a higher uncertainty in its estimated parame-
ters could be inferred from computer simulations. In any
case, the signiﬁcant width of both signals, with the conse-
quent absence of resolution of hyperﬁne features on them (it
must be considered that ca. 25% of the molybdenum—95Mo
and 97Mo isotopes—presents nuclear spin I = 5/2, while
99.75% of the vanadium presents I = 7/2), suggests that the
paramagnetic centers are immersed into magnetically active
environments (probably subjected to strong spin–spin inter-
actions and of a considerable magnitude for centers giving
rise to signal A1). In addition, some of the samples show
a set of relatively narrow features overlapped on the spec-
trum of signals A1 + A2, which corresponds to the presence
of residual amounts of isolated V4+ species. Another signal
represented by a feature appearing at ⟨g⟩= 3.7 is apparent
for some of the samples, particularly MVSK-2 and MVSK-
4, although it can be also present in minor amounts for the
other samples. This most likely corresponds to the forbidden
transition (ms = ±2) of Mo5+ ionic pairs in an excited
triplet state [32], based on the fact that a certain intensity in-
crease is observed upon recording the spectrum at 298 K. No
systematic study of these aspects has been done since they
do not appear of relevance in the context of the present work.
Concerning the quantitative aspects, the overall amount
of paramagnetic species detected is 158.8, 167.1, and
178.1 µmol g−1, for MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4 sam-
ples, respectively, which correspond to about 3% of the
total amount of Mo. Concerning the relative contributions
of signals A1 and A2, the A1/A2 intensity ratio displays,
according to computer simulation results, values of 4.0, 5.0,
and 5.3 for samples MVS, MVSK-2, and MVSK-4, respec-
tively.
Binding energies at peak maximum and peak half widths
(FWHM) of the V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, and K2p3/2
core-level lines in the XPS spectra of the MVS, MVSK-2,
and MVSK-4 samples, as well as the surface metal atomic
ratio determined from XPS data, are given in Table 2. For
comparative purposes, the XPS results of the MoVSbO sam-
ple calcined initially in air at 553 K and then in N2 at 873 K
(sample MVS-A-N) are also included. It can be noticed that
the Mo/V/Sb surface atomic ratios of the catalysts remains
almost the same after the incorporation of potassium and are
in close agreement with the bulk composition (Table 1).
The FWHM values of the Mo3d peaks are similar in all
samples and can be ﬁtted with two components at BE =
232.7 and 231.7 eV for the Mo3d5/2 peak, which can be as-
signed to Mo6+ and Mo5+ species [24,33–35]. Noteworthy,
a Mo5+/Mototal atomic ratio of about 0.35 (Mo6+/Mo5+
molar ratio close to 2) is determined for samples calcined
under N2. This contrasts with detection of exclusively Mo6+
species for MVS-A-N, suggesting that a higher overall oxi-
dation degree is achieved in this sample as a consequence of
the intermediate calcination treatment under air performed
in this sample, in agreement with XRD results.
The V2p3/2 core-level spectra of all samples can be de-
composed into two components at BE = 516.3 and 517.4 eV,
which can be assigned to V4+ and V5+, respectively [24,35].
V4+ cations seem to be the main component in undoped
and K-doped catalysts, presenting a V4+/Vtotal atomic ratio
of 0.84–0.87 (V4+/V5+ molar ratio around 5.5) for MVS
and MVSK-n samples (Table 3). No V3+ species have been
detected in these catalysts. However, V3+ species (BE =
515.5 eV) are observed in sample MVS-A-N, which shows
V4+/Vtotal and V3+/Vtotal atomic ratios of 0.61 and 0.29.
So, a partial reduction of V4+ to V3+ is apparently produced
for this sample.
While the addition of potassium to the MoVSb oxide does
not appear to have a strong inﬂuence on the surface composi-
tion and the nature of V2p or Mo3d XPS spectra, a different
behavior is inferred for Sb, according to the Sb3d XPS spec-
tra (Fig. 4). The peak width of the Sb3d3/2 line is sensitively
higher in the K-doped samples than in the samples without
potassium (1.95 and 1.70 eV, respectively), which could be
related to the presence of another species or to differential
charging of the samples. Since no broadening has been ob-
served in the peaks from other zones in the spectra of the
K-doped samples, contributions from differential charging
of the samples can be neglected. We must indicate that the
identiﬁcation of the Sb oxidation state is complicated be-
cause the Sb3d5/2 peaks overlap with O1s peaks and the
BE separation of Sb3+ and Sb5+ is relatively small (approx-
imately 0.6 eV). The deconvolution of the Sb3d3/2 line for

the K-doped samples is shown in Fig. 4. The Sb3d3/2 peak
of the K-containing samples can be ﬁtted with two compo-
nents at BE = 540.2 and 539.4 eV, assigned to Sb5+ and
Sb3+, respectively [26,36,37], while only one component at
BE = 539.5 eV, of Sb3+, is observed in the K-free sample.
These results suggest an oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ on
the catalyst surface (with Sb5+/Sbtotal atomic ratios of 0.17–
0.29) after the incorporation of potassium. However, the for-
mation of Sb5+ species is lower than that observed in the
sample MVS-A-N (Sb5+/Sbtotal atomic ratios of 0.81). Such
on-surface oxidation is not a consequence of the presence of
oxygen during the calcination of these samples, but it could
be related with the presence of nitrates (from the KNO3 used
to incorporate potassium) during the calcinations step. In
fact, when the MoVSb precursor is calcined initially with
O2 and then with N2 (sample MVS-A-N), the partial oxi-
dation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ is accompanied by partial reduction
of V5+ to V4+ and V3+, although without apparent modiﬁ-
cation of the oxidation state of Mo (Mo6+). At this point, it
has to be said that in V–Sb-containing catalysts Sb5+ species
are formed from Sb3+ at the expense of the partial reduction
of V5+ to V4+ and V3+ [36,37], although, in the presence
of Mo6+, V3+ formed is rapidly oxidized to V4+ with the
formation of Mo5+.

sorption spectra at the Sb LI edge of samples MVS, MVSK-

references. The edge maximum corresponds to the electronic
transition from the 2s1/2 to the empty 5p orbital, and the en-
ergy involved strongly depends on the occupancy of the 5s
orbital, i.e., on the presence of Sb3+ or Sb5+. The edge po-
sition is very sensitive to the oxidation state of antimony,
appearing at 4703.0 eV for Sb3+ and at 4708.0 eV for Sb5+,
as can be observed for Sb2O3 and FeSbO4, respectively, in
Fig. 5. This renders XANES spectroscopy very valuable for
determining the valence of antimony, information which is
not easily available by any other technique.
The spectra of the K-free and K-containing MVS sam-
ples (see Fig. 5, spectra b and c) exhibit the edge maxima
at 4703.4 eV, clearly indicating that antimony is present as
Sb3+ in both oxides [26]. However, when the parent MVS
oxide is calcined in air before the treatment in N2, i.e., sam-
ple MVS-A-N, the maximum is shifted at 4708.0 eV char-
acteristic of Sb5+, while a shoulder at ca. 4703 eV of Sb3+
is also observed, evidencing the presence of antimony in
both oxidation states (Fig. 5d). Fitting the spectrum using
a combination of the two references for Sb3+ and Sb5+ the
Sb3+/Sb5+ ratio can be estimated to be approximately 1.
Therefore, bulk oxidation of Sb3+ occurs upon the calcina-
tion in air of a MoVSbO sample (MVS-A-N) but not upon
incorporation of potassium.
Reported in Fig. 6 are the infrared spectra of ammo-
nia adsorbed on undoped (Fig. 6a) and K-doped (Fig. 6b)
MoVSbO catalysts after evacuation at 373 K. The adsorp-
tion band at 1608 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric
bending vibration of ammonia adsorbed on Lewis acid sites,
while the band at 1423 cm−1 corresponds to an asymmetric

deformation vibration (δas) of the ammonium ions (NH4+)
on Brønsted acid sites [38]. The broadening of the latter band
must be related to a certain heterogeneity in the Brønsted
acid sites, or to a splitting of the δas vibration as a conse-
quence of changes in the adsorption symmetry of the NH4+
molecule at the catalyst surface.
The incorporation of potassium apparently decreases the
intensity of both bands, thus conﬁrming the diminution of
the number of acid sites of the catalyst as already observed
upon incorporation of alkali metals on V- or Mo-based cata-
lysts [39–43].
Conversely, no signiﬁcant structural changes have been
detected by XRD in the MVS and K-doped catalysts after
the catalytic test, and only the MVA-A-N sample shows a
slight decrease in the intensity of the peaks corresponding to
MoO3 (Fig. 1d). The XPS study of the undoped and K-doped
MoVSbO used samples shows neither changes in the catalyst
composition nor important variations in the oxidation state
of each element on the catalyst surface. In addition, Sb3+
was also mainly observed by EXAFS in the used catalysts.
Therefore, we can assume that, under the reaction conditions
used in this work, our catalysts are reasonably stable during
the reaction tests.
3.2. Catalytic results for the selective oxidation of propane

the selectivities to the main reaction products obtained dur-

tained during the oxidation of propane at 653 K on undoped
and K-doped catalysts. Partial oxidation products (propy-
lene, acrylic acid, acrolein, acetone, and acetic acid) and

carbon oxides have been observed in all cases, although their
corresponding selectivities strongly depend on the catalyst
composition.
The undoped MVS sample presents a very low selec-
tivity to acrylic acid but an important selectivity to acetic
acid. Comparing the samples MVS and MVS-A-N, it can be
concluded that no apparent modiﬁcation in the catalytic per-
formance occurs when the sample is previously calcined in
air at 553 K before the heat treatment at 873 K in N2 (Ta-
ble 3).
The catalytic behavior of MoVSbO catalysts is com-
pletely modiﬁed when potassium is added to the catalyst
(Fig. 7 and Table 3). The incorporation of small amounts
of potassium notably increases the selectivity to acrylic acid
and propylene, decreasing the selectivity of both acetic acid
and carbon oxides. However, the propane conversion de-
creases with increasing the K content in the catalyst. In this
way the sample with a K/Mo ratio of 0.02 presents less than
half of propane conversion than the undoped samples.
A relative increase in the selectivity to organic acids
(acrylic and acetic acids) without apparent changes in the
propane conversion has been obtained when a MoVSbO cat-
alyst was treated with a K-free aqueous solution following
a procedure similar to that used for the preparation of the
K-containing samples [27] or by grinding a Mo6V2SbOx cat-
alyst [23]. However, the increase in the selectivity to acrylic
acid in the last two cases was very modest compared to the
changes obtained for the K-doped catalysts. So, the changes
observed in the K-doped catalysts cannot be explained by
mechanical modiﬁcations of the crystalline phases, but by
the effect of K-induced modiﬁcation of the catalyst surface.
The results of Fig. 7 indicate that the selectivity to propy-
lene decreases and the selectivity to acrylic acid increases
when the reaction temperature increases. However, the ef-
fect of the reaction temperature on the selectivity to acrylic
acid is a consequence of the variation of the propane conver-
sion. In this way, the highest selectivity to acrylic acid was
observed at propane conversions between 20 and 30%.
The yields of partial oxidation products, i.e., acrylic
acid, propylene, and acetic acid, obtained at 653 K over
the studied catalysts are reported in Fig. 8. An opposite
trend in the yields of acetic and acrylic acids is observed
when the amount of potassium incorporated to the cata-
lysts is increased, whereas the yield of propylene remains
almost unchanged. Moreover, no changes in the sum of the
yield of partial oxidation products (acrylic acid, acetic acid,
and propylene) are apparently observed when the amount
of potassium on the catalysts is changed. Therefore, the

lower conversion observed in the K-doped catalysts must be
mainly related to a decrease in the formation of carbon ox-
ides. So, the incorporation of potassium favors an enhance-
ment of both the selectivity and the yield of acrylic acid by
decreasing the formation of both acetic acid and carbon ox-
ides. It must be noted that the yields to acrylic acid obtained
over the K-doped samples are higher than those previously
reported in the literature for MoVSbO [23] or Nb-containing
MoVSbO catalysts [20–22], although lower than those re-
ported in the patent literature [19,44].
In order to gain a better understanding of the different
pathways in the mechanism for propane oxidation, we have
carried out some experiments of propylene oxidation, since
propylene can be considered as intermediate in propane ox-
idation. Table 4 shows the catalytic results obtained during
the propylene oxidation on undoped and K-doped catalysts.
Acrylic acid, acetic acid, acetone, and carbon oxides are
mainly observed, while acrolein and acetaldehyde were de-
tected with very low selectivities. Acetone was the most
important partial oxidation reaction product at low temper-
atures and low propylene conversions, while acrylic acid
(mainly obtained on K-doped catalysts) and/or acetic acid
(mainly obtained on undoped MVS samples) were obtained
at high reaction temperatures and high propane conversions.
This trend is similar to that observed during the propane ox-
idation.
4. Discussion
4.1. On the catalyst characterization
The characterization results presented here suggest that
the incorporation of K modiﬁes only the characteristics
of the surface of the MoVSbO catalyst, although whether
changes in the nature of the crystalline phases are induced
is still unclear. The XRD patterns of K-free and K-doped
catalysts suggest the presence of similar crystalline phases.
According to this, SEM/EDX results indicate the presence
of essentially two compositionally different zones in the
catalysts. Vanadium appears homogeneously distributed in
the crystallites, which suggests that it is incorporated to the
structure of Mo–Sb–O mixed oxide, as already proposed for
Mo–V–Te–Nb–O [24] and Mo–V–Sb–O mixed oxides [23].
However, the XRD by itself cannot be used in the determi-
nation of the crystalline phases in these catalysts. In fact,
recent results published on MoVSbO [23] and MoVSbNbO
[20,21] catalysts suggest the presence of several SbMoVO
crystalline phases depending on the calcination conditions:
Sb4Mo10O30 and Sb2Mo10O31 in samples heat-treated at
873 K in N2 and activated in He [20,21] and (Sb2O)M6O18
and (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V) in samples acti-
vated in air at 643 K for 20 min followed by a second heat
treatment, in pure nitrogen, at 873 K for 2 h [26]. Moreover,
the XRD pattern of Sb4Mo10O30 is similar to that shown
by (Sb2O)M6O18, while the XRD pattern of Sb2Mo10O31
is similar to that of (SbO)2M20O56, making difﬁcult an un-

ambiguous attribution of the diffraction peaks. The most im-
portant differences among these crystalline phases appear to
be related to the oxidation states of Sb: only Sb3+ is present
in Sb4Mo10O30 and Sb2Mo10O31 [20,25], while Sb3+ and
Sb5+ are observed in (Sb2O)M6O18 (with a Sb3+/Sb5+ ra-
tio of 63/37) and (SbO)2M20O56 (with a Sb3+/Sb5+ ratio
of 11/89) [26]. So, a possible discrimination between these
structures could be established on the basis of the presence
of Sb ions with different oxidation states.
Therefore, the presence of both Sb3+ and Sb5+ in MVS-
A-N, determined by XANES, suggests the possible presence
of (Sb2O)M6O18 and (SbO)2M20O56 (with M = Mo and V),
rather than Sb4Mo10O31 and Sb2Mo10O31 [26], in catalysts
ﬁrst calcined in oxygen and then heat-treated in N2. Sb5+
species have not been observed by XANES in both undoped
and K-doped catalysts heat-treated in N2, i.e., MVS and
MVSK-n series, suggesting the presence of Sb4M10O31 and
Sb2M10O31 (with M = Mo and V). Only a partial oxidation
of surface Sb3+ to Sb5+ species, which are not observed in
the undoped sample, and a decrease in the number of acid
sites, especially of Brønsted type, are observed upon the ad-
dition of potassium on the surface of the MoVSbO mixed
oxide.
The EPR experiments evidence the presence of two dif-
ferent magnetic environments for the paramagnetic cations
(Mo5+ and possibly also V4+), corresponding to signals A1
and A2. It is tempting to establish a correlation between
the two signals and the presence of two distinct phases (as
suggested also by the EDX results of Table 1) into which
the corresponding paramagnetic species would be immersed.
The larger width of signal A1 suggests shorter average dis-
tances between the spins, and then a higher concentration
of Mo5+ (and V4+) species would be expected in this mag-
netic domain. It must be noted that the amount of paramag-
netic species detected in these spectra is relatively low when
compared to the total amount of Mo and V (around 3%,
considering the sample compositions determined by AAS,
Table 1). The considerable higher concentration of paramag-
netic species obtained by XPS (Table 2) and the low sur-
face area of these oxides (Table 1) would suggest that they
are exclusively located at surface or near surface. However,
this is not consistent with the presence of mixed valence
(Mo6+/Mo5+ or V5+/V4+) phases observed by XRD. In
fact, the EPR spectrum of sample MVS recorded under air
(at atmospheric pressure) shows almost no modiﬁcation in
the signals lineshape or amplitude, suggesting a bulk na-
ture for most of the detected paramagnetic centers. There-
fore, it appears that a signiﬁcant amount of the paramagnetic
species must escape detection due to antiferromagnetic cou-
plings [45].
Moreover, the relatively low amount of Sb5+ species de-
tected by XPS on the surface of K-doped catalysts and the
fact that Sb5+ species are not detected by XANES, along
with consideration that structural or chemical transforma-
tions induced by K ions must mainly affect the catalyst
surface, suggest that oxidized Sb5+ is only located on the
Scheme 1. Reaction network for the oxidation of propane on MoVSb-based
catalysts.
catalyst surface. A different conclusion can be proposed in
the sample initially calcined in air and then heat-treated in
N2 (sample MVS-A-N). The XPS spectra of this sample sug-
gest a high Sb5+/Sb3+ ratio on the surface, besides several
oxidation states for V, i.e., V5+, V4+, and V3+, with a higher
overall reduction state. These results suggest that a different
solid-state reaction occurs upon calcination of the sample
under oxygen, which favors a redox reaction between V and
Sb, as suggested in other V–Sb–O-based catalysts [35,36].
4.2. Selective oxidation of propane on undoped and
K-doped MoVSbO catalysts
According to our results, a reaction network of propane
oxidation similar to that previously reported for MoVTe-
[16,24,46,47]or MoVSb-based [20–23] catalysts can be pro-
posed (Scheme 1), with a higher selectivity to acetone and
acetic acid over the latter. Propylene is initially formed from
propane on both undoped and K-doped catalysts. Accord-
ing to the results of Table 4, propylene can consecutively
react on the catalyst surface giving three parallel reactions:
(i) partial oxidation to acrolein/acrylic acid; (ii) hydration
and oxidative scission to acetone/acetic acid; (iii) direct ox-
idation to carbon oxides. It is clear that the modiﬁcation of
the catalyst surface by the K incorporation strongly changes
the reaction rates of the parallel reactions. In this way, a
higher formation of acrylic acid and a lower formation of
acetic acid and carbon oxides have been observed in the
K-doped catalysts (Fig. 7).
It is generally accepted that both the selective oxidation
and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are initiated
via H abstraction from propane by a concerted mechanism
over acid–base pairs [3,4,16–18,21–24]. The Lewis acid site
(V5+ cation) and basic oxygen (O2−) interacts with the α-
and β-hydrogen of propane, respectively, to form propy-
lene [24,48]. The incorporation of K ions on the surface of
V- [39–41] or Mo-based [41–43] catalysts has been reported
to modify the acid character and the nature of surface metal
species, favoring the achievement of higher selectivities to
propylene from propane. Accordingly, the incorporation of
potassium to MoVSbO catalysts is expected to increase the
selectivity to propylene during the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion [39–43], but it is apparently surprising the fact that the
selectivity to acrylic acid is also increased.
It is known that acid sites favor the formation of acetic
acid, and that V2O5–MoO3 catalyst favors the oxidative scis-
372
T. Blasco et al. / Journal of Catalysis 228 (2004) 362–373
sion of propylene in the presence of water vapor to form
acetone/acetic acid [49]. Meanwhile, alkaline cations pro-
mote the allylic oxidation of propylene or butylenes over
Mo-containing catalysts [50,51]. According to these results,
the incorporation of potassium to the MoVSbO catalyst sur-
face decreases the number of acid sites, and then the forma-
tion of both acetic acid and carbon oxides. A similar effect
is observed upon the addition of H2O in the feed, which en-
hances the selectivity to acrylic acid during the oxidation of
propane on MoVSbNbO [22] or VPO [6]. So, it appears that
the elimination of the strongest acid sites favors the partial
oxidation rather than the hydration (and the oxidative scis-
sion) reaction.
Beside the decrease in the surface acidity, the incorpora-
tion of K on the surface of the MoVSbO catalyst provokes
the partial oxidation of surface Sb3+ to Sb5+, which could
favor the formation of acrylic acid by an allylic mecha-
nism [18]. However, the catalytic results over MVS (Sb3+)
and MVS-A-N (Sb3+/Sb5+) suggest no apparent inﬂuence
of the oxidation state of Sb on catalytic behavior, and then
that the increase in the selectivity to acrylic acid on K-doped
MoVSbO catalysts must be mainly due to changes in the cat-
alyst acidity.
At the moment, it is not possible to establish the position
of K+ cations at the catalyst surface. Potassium could be lo-
cated over oxygen atoms of Mo, V, or Sb, replacing surface
protons and giving rise to Me–O–K surface bonds, or into
the empty channels of the crystalline phases. Though the K+
cations seems to favor, directly or indirectly, the appearance
of Sb5+ species on the catalyst surface, the mechanism is
still unclear. A higher effort will be made in order to clarify
the nature of active sites in each reaction step (oxidative de-
hydrogenation, O insertion or oxidative scission) as well as
the sites in which potassium cations are incorporated.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the incorporation of potassium on the sur-
face of MVSbO catalysts enhances the formation and the se-
lectivity to acrylic acid and decreases the formation of acetic
acid and carbon oxides during the oxidation of propane. The
presence of potassium diminishes the acidity of the catalyst
surface, avoiding undesiderable reactions and favoring the
selective formation of acrylic acid.
No important modiﬁcation in the characteristics of the
catalysts has been observed after the incorporation of potas-
sium. In fact, the main characterization results (XRD,
SEM, EDX, FTIR, EPR, and XANES) suggest clearly
that Sb4M10O30 and Sb2M10O31 (with Sb3+ and M =
Mo and V) are mainly present in undoped and K-doped
catalysts heat-treated in N2, whereas (Sb2O)M6O18 and
(SbO)2M20O56 (with Sb3+/Sb5+ and M = Mo and V) can
be proposed as major phases in the sample ﬁrst calcined in
air and then heat-treated in N2. Moreover, a partial oxida-
tion of Sb3+ to Sb5+ (Sb5+/Sbtotal of 0.2–0.3) is observed
on the surface of the K-doped catalysts, probably as a conse-
quence of the presence of nitrates during the calcination of
doped samples.
A further “in-situ” study of these catalysts will help to
determine the exact nature of crystalline phases and the pos-
sible incorporation of V species in the structure of Mo–Sb–O
mixed oxides.
