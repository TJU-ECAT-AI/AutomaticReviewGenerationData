This volume comprises 23 chapters, 15 of which are focused directly on catalytic chemistry and applications of transition-metal oxides. The opening paragraph of the preface suggests that this volume was intended to be a comprehensive survey that should serve as both an introductory source and a reference on metal oxides. While the content should be of significant interest to anyone seeking introductory and reference material on catalytic transition-metal oxides, it is less likely to appeal to those seeking general coverage of metal oxides. Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume.
The first five chapters contain a variety of topics that do not appear to have any particular logical order. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with molecular species of early transition-metal oxides on various metal oxide supports. These are followed by a short, but well-written, general chapter on point defect thermodynamics and the kinetics of transport in oxides. The fourth chapter jumps to a discussion of the characterization of metal valence states using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered imaging in transmission electron microscopy, illustrated with several well-chosen examples. The uninitiated reader may have problems appreciating the key issues with EELS spectra that make this approach succeed or fail in providing valence quantification. The topic for Chapter 5 is the evaluation of surface composition, which is a critical issue for understanding the catalytic chemistry on transition-metal oxide surfaces and is an area in which unambiguous characterization poses some very significant challenges.
Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties. Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. It is perhaps the most important chapter in this volume in terms of utility for those needing a general introduction to the fundamentals of bulk metal oxides. Chapter 7 is perhaps less helpful as an introduction because it focuses narrowly on manganite colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high-Tc superconductors. This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis. Also woven into this chapter is a section on resonant X-ray scattering, but the presentation is focused on orbital ordering phenomena in manganites and thus is not likely to be informative for the typical reader. This is unfortunate since the same technique can be a very powerful tool for applications in oxide characterization for cases where elemental distributions are difficult to resolve with conventional (off-edge) X-ray diffraction.
Chapters 8−11 survey redox and acid−base properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites. Chapter 12 is the lone contribution dealing with synthetic methods and is specifically aimed at combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput evaluation. Chapters 13−15 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis. Chapters 17 and 18 target total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions, respectively. Photocatalysis for splitting water is covered in Chapters 19 and 20 for TiO2-based systems and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides, respectively. Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides, and Chapter 22 is a discussion of semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors. The volume concludes with an overview of solid oxide fuel cell anode materials.
Overall, this volume contains many useful contributions, particularly for those working in transition-metal oxide catalysis. A wealth of references are given with each chapter, providing a valuable starting point for those new to each area of focus.
