Abstract
A series of Pt promoted ceria–zirconia mixed oxides was prepared, characterized, and tested for the low temperature water–gas shift reaction. An
enhancement in the water–gas shift rate was observed by doping zirconium atoms into ceria to form a binary oxide for Pt promoted catalysts. By
characterization using TPR and XANES, doping zirconia to ceria decreased the temperature for the surface reduction step. However, the total number
ofbridging OHgroupdefectsitesdecreased,asZrremainedtoagreatextentintheZr4+oxidation state.ThiswasconﬁrmedbyCOadsorption,whereby
the density of total surface formates was found to decline with increased Zr concentrations. However, the formate forward turnover rate in steam was
increased by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone. Both the overall rate of the formate decomposition
and the water–gas shift rate, as measured by the CO conversion, passed through a maximum with increasing Zr content.
Two types offormates were observed, those associated with a ceria-rich surface phase, and those associated with a zirconia-rich surface phase. The
relative amounts of the two formates correlated with the Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS. EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid
solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the Zr–Ce interaction was observed,
increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio. The sensitivity to added carbon dioxide in the feed of the undoped and a Zr doped catalyst was also explored.

1. Introduction
Ceria is an important component in automobile catalytic
converter catalysts for buffering the partial pressure of oxygen
[1–3]. To facilitate bulk to surface oxygen transport, zirconium
is typically doped into the ceria cubic matrix [4–6]. Ceria–
zirconia binary solid solutions have also been reported to
exhibit far greater oxygen storage capacity (OSC) than ceria
alone [7,8]. These characteristics are also of interest from the
perspective of the water–gas shift reaction [9].
One proposed mechanism for water–gas shift is a surface
formate mechanism [10,11]. In this mechanism, reduction of
the surface of ceria is facilitated by addition of a metal promoter
[12–15], resulting in the formation of bridging OH groups at
Ce3+ defect sites. One possibility for their formation is the
dissociation of H2O at oxygen vacancies generated during the
surface reduction process [10].
Note that in Schemes 1 and 2, bold Ce atoms represent the
Ce3+ oxidation state, while normal type Ce atoms represents the
Ce4+ oxidation state.

However, another possibility is direct formation of the
bridging OH groups via H2 dissociation on the metal and
spillover to the oxide, as follows [16].
One important role of the metal, therefore, may be
to facilitate the shuttling of hydrogen to and from the
surface of the ceria. Considering the surface formate
mechanism [10], described below, the metal can assist in
two reaction steps, including: (1) the generation of the active
site bridging OH groups and (2) the removal of H2 during
water-assisted
surface
formate
decomposition
[17],
as
follows:
In the surface formate mechanism, the rate-determining
step has been proposed to be the decomposition of surface
formate. Interestingly, both H2O and type/loading of the
metal promoter have been identiﬁed to facilitate formate
decomposition, the latter recently attributed to an enhanced
hydrogen abstraction rate during cleaving of the formate C–
H bond [17]. Hydrogen transfer processes were also recently
found to be enhanced during methanol synthesis when ceria
was doped into a copper containing zirconia catalyst [18],
and the rate of the reaction was enhanced considerably
(factor of 2.4).
It is necessary, therefore, that the surface of ceria be retained
in the Ce3+ state. Interestingly, increasing the loading of Pt [16]
or Au [19,20] promoter was recently found to break the metal-
oxide interaction at lower and lower temperatures, facilitating
the reduction of the ceria surface most likely by spillover of
dissociated hydrogen from the metal to oxide. However, from a
commercial viewpoint, there is a limit to the amount of noble
metal promoter that can be added in an economically viable
manner. Zr addition, therefore, could play an important role in
decreasing the amount of noble metal promoter that is required
to facilitate surface reduction. If O-transport is facilitated in
the bulk of ceria–zirconia over ceria alone, then it is reasonable
to expect that surface O atoms would also be removed more
easily from the surface of the binary oxide, so that Ce3+ atoms
(i.e. oxygen vacancies) could be formed at a lower temperature
than ceria alone. It also follows, then, that bridging OH groups
could be generated at the surface of the catalyst at a lower
temperature than that required for ceria alone. Finally, if a
metal promoter is added, the formation of bridging OH groups
could be anticipated to be achieved at an even lower
temperature. That is, the metal-support interaction could be
overcome at a lower temperature for a Pt promoted ceria–
zirconia catalyst relative to Pt/ceria alone. Hydrogen abstrac-
tion might also be expected to occur at a faster rate during
formate decomposition.
One drawback to Zr addition, though, would be the fact that
Zr likely remains, to a large extent, in a 4+ oxidation state at the
surface. Therefore, while Ce atoms would be expected to
reduce at a lower temperature, accompanied by bridging OH
group formation, the downside would be a decreased number of
those defect sites. Certainly, bridging OH groups have been
observed on zirconia by infrared spectroscopy, indicating that
defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies or bridging OH groups) are
present. However, it is anticipated, based on the above
discussion, that Zr would have a lower density of bridging
OH groups than Ce after a metal-promoter catalyzed surface
reduction step.
An alternate proposed mechanism is that of the ceria-
mediated redox process [9], which also involves reduced defect
centers on the ceria surface.
In this view, the oxidation state of ceria is changing back and
forth from the Ce4+ to the Ce3+ oxidation states via O transfer
from the surface of ceria, with CO reducing the ceria, and H2O
replenishing the oxygen vacancy. The doping of zirconia into
ceria to facilitate O-mobility has been proposed to speed up the
WGS rate via this process.
In this study, a number of spectroscopic techniques are
used to probe these phenomena. To estimate the surface
composition of Ce relative to Zr, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized. To examine whether or
not a binary oxide solid solution was formed, extended X-ray
absorption
ﬁne
structure
spectroscopy
(EXAFS)
was
employed. The surface reduction processes were monitored
by a combination of temperature programmed reduction
(TPR)
and
X-ray
absorption
near
edge
spectroscopy
(XANES). To examine the impact of zirconia addition on
the intensity of formates present on the catalyst surface, as
well as their decomposition rate in the presence of steam,
diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
was carried out using an in situ reactor cell. Finally, activity
studies were conducted using a ﬁxed bed reactor system. The
feed composition was selected to mimic typical conditions
expected in the low temperature shift stage of a fuel processor
for hydrogen production/puriﬁcation for fuel cell applica-
tions. Therefore, a high H2O:CO ratio was used, and H2 and
CO2 were included in the feed.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Along with preparation of ceria and zirconia, four ceria–
zirconia
binary
oxides
were
also
prepared,
including
Ce0.90Zr0.10, Ce0.75Zr0.25, Ce0.50Zr0.50, and Ce0.25Zr0.75. The
precursor salts used were cerium nitrate and zirconyl nitrate,
which were completely dissolved in aqueous solution that
was mildly heated. Urea was used to slowly release the
precipitating agent, the hydroxide ion, a technique that
generally leads to a more homogenous precipitation, and
signiﬁcantly higher surface area materials relative to standard
precipitation with ammonium nitrate alone [21]. Finally,
ammonium
hydroxide
was
added
dropwise
to
ensure
complete precipitation. The resulting precipitate was washed,
ﬁltered, dried, and calcined at 400 8C for 4 h. Tetraammine
platinum (II) nitrate was the metal promoter precursor, and it
was added by standard incipient wetness impregnation. After
Pt addition, the catalyst was re-calcined at 400 8C for 4 h. Pt
loadings for ceria–zirconia catalysts have been veriﬁed by
ICP analysis.
2.2. BET surface area
BET surface area measurements were conducted with a
Micromeritics Tristar 3000 gas adsorption analyzer. In each
test, approximately 0.25–0.30 g of sample (either binary oxide
or Pt promoted catalyst) was used. Nitrogen adsorption was
carried out at its boiling temperature.
2.3. Temperature programmed reduction
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted
on binary oxide and Pt promoted catalysts using a Zeton-
Altamira AMI-200 unit, equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). The system was modiﬁed to allow heating to
as high as 1150 8C. Argon was used as the reference gas, and
10% H2 (balance Ar) was ﬂowed through the catalyst at
30 cm3/min as the temperature was increased from 50 to
1150 8C at a ramp rate of 10 8C/min. The thermocouple was
situated inside the catalyst bed. Approximately 250 mg of
catalyst was used.
2.4. X-ray absorption near edge and extended X-ray
absorption ﬁne structure spectroscopies
XANES spectra at the Ce LIII and Zr K edges, and EXAFS
spectra at the Zr K edge, were recorded at Beamline X-18b at
the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York. The beamline
parameters and crystal detuning procedure have been pre-
viously reported [16].
Especially in the case of binary oxide catalyst studies, it is
imperative to calculate sample thicknesses beforehand. We
determined sample thicknesses by calculating the amount of
sample, vD, in grams per square centimeter, using the thickness
equation:
vD ¼ lnðI0=ItÞ=Sðm=rÞ jw j
where m/r is the total cross-section (absorption coefﬁcient/
density) of element j in the sample at the absorption edge of the
EXAFS element under study in cm3/g, w j is the weight fraction
of element j in the sample, and ln(I0/It) was taken over a typical
range of 1–2.5. Using the calculation for vD, and the cross-
sectional area of the pellet, the mass was readily obtained. In
order to prepare a self supporting wafer, free of pin-holes, boron
nitride was used to dilute the catalyst powder. After the cell was
purged for a long period with inert gas at a high ﬂow rate to
ensure air removal, the samples were treated in situ using a
hydrogen/helium mixture (150 cm3/min H2 and 500 cm3/min
He). Samples were scanned in the temperature range of room
temperature to 300 8C. Scans were obtained in transmission
mode to conﬁrm the temperature for surface shell reduction of
the partially reducible oxide. XANES spectra were back-
ground-subtracted and normalized prior to comparison. Stan-
dard data reduction methods were utilized to process the
EXAFS results including edge calibration, background sub-
traction, normalization, truncation, conversion to k-space, and
background subtraction in k-space using appropriate splines to
determine chi(k). Finally, an appropriate k-range was selected,
and the Fourier transform was carried out. The Fourier trans-
form magnitude spectra were compared qualitatively.
2.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS experiments were monitored with a Thermo VG
Scientiﬁc Minilab. Mg Ka X-ray (kinetic energy 1273 eV)
were used with a dual cathode X-ray gun. The pressure was
maintained in analysis chamber generally between 9 and
5E10 Torr. The data were collected using a hemispherical
electron analyzer.
The spectra were ﬁrst baseline corrected. Then, for both
ceria and zirconia, the areas for the 3d3/2 and the 3d5/2 peaks
were calculated, and for oxygen and carbon, the areas of the 1s
peak were calculated. Scoﬁeld factors [22] were employed to
estimate the different atomic ratios of interest (e.g. Zr/Ce, Ce/
O, Zr/O, and (Ce + Zr)/O) for each sample. Prior to plotting the
XPS results, carbon was subtracted out and the spectra were
normalized relative to the Ce, Zr, and O signals alone, for
purposes of comparison.
2.6. Diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform
spectroscopy
A Nicolet Nexus 870 was used, equipped with a DTGS-
TEC detector. A chamber ﬁtted with ZnSe windows was
utilized as the WGS reactor for in situ measurements. During
a run the catalyst was ﬁrst activated at 300 8C in hydrogen
and then cooled to 130 8C in nitrogen. Formates were
generated on the surface by adsorption of CO, whereby the
ﬂows were maintained at 3.75 cm3/min CO and 135 cm3/min

N2 (i.e. 2.7% CO). After the pseudo-stabilized formate was
generated, the cell was purged with N2 and a mixture of
H2O:N2 was ﬂowed at 63:135 cm3/min (i.e. 32% H2O).
Decomposition of the formate was recorded with time to
provide an indication of the impact of the Zr dopant on the
formate decomposition rate for the Pt/ceria system.
2.7. Reaction testing
Steady state catalytic activity and carbon dioxide sensitivity
measurements were carried out using a ﬁxed bed reactor system
consisting of a 0.500 stainless steel tube with an internal
thermocouple located inside the catalyst bed. Experiments were
conducted using 200 mg of catalyst diluted with 1.8 g of silica
beads. Conditions were chosen to reﬂect those in a fuel
processor following the high temperature shift stage, including
H2 and CO2 in the feed. The following conditions were
selected: H2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 = 26.1:3:29.8:11.2:29.9%. Total
gas ﬂow = 250 cm3/min.
The sensitivity of the catalyst to carbon dioxide was
also carried out. Inert balancing gas was replaced by carbon
dioxide to maintain constant the partial pressures of the other
gas constituents, as well as the total gas space velocity.
Switching was carried out from the initial conditions without
CO2—H2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 = 30.8:3.5:35.1:0:30.6%,
to
the
carbon dioxide-containing conditions—H2O:CO:H2:CO2:N2 =
30.8:3.5:35.1:8.0:22.6%, and then returning to the conditions
without CO2, in the temperature range of 235–275 8C. Total gas
ﬂow = 212 cm3/min.
3. Results and discussion
Results of BET surface area measurements are reported in
Table 1. The surface areas ranged from 108 to 156 m2/g, while
the average pore volume remained quite uniform. For all of the
catalysts, except Pt/ZrO2, the surface area decreased somewhat
with Pt loading, while the average pore radius typically
increased slightly. This behavior usually represents some
blocking of the narrowest pores by the metal. The increase in
BET surface area for Pt/ZrO2 was veriﬁed several times,
although no suitable explanation was found.
XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from
carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1A–C and Table 2. The results are
for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter. In
Fig. 1A, there is a general increasing trend in area with Zr
loading. However, the trend is by no means linear. In fact, the Zr
composition at the surface was quite similar for the 10%, 25%,
and even 50% Zr-doped samples. A large increase was observed
in moving to the 75% Zr sample. The Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2
peaks could be ﬁtted very well using two Gaussian distribu-
tions. Similarly, for ceria, there is a general decreasing trend,
but the greatest change was again observed between 50% and
75% Zr levels, while the results for the 10%, 25%, and 50%
samples are more similar. The peaks for Ce 3d are complex
(Fig. 1B), and are split into the 3/2 and 5/2 ionizations. The
bands are further complicated by satellite features commonly
assigned with the letter v for 3d5/2 and u for 3d3/2 and given
primed
labels
[23,24].

(882 eV),
v0
(885.5 eV), v00

u0
(904 eV),
u00
(907.5 eV),
and
u000
(916.5 eV) belong to the Ce 3d3/2 ionization. The bands
were ﬁtted well with eight Gaussian curves, except in the region
between approximately 910 and 912 eV, which was excluded
from the ﬁtting range. Due to charging effects, very pronounced
for insulator materials, spectral shifts were not analyzed.
Rather, we were interested only in obtaining information
regarding relative surface concentrations.
A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration
was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C). The total
areas remained quite similar, as should be the case considering
the stoichiometry. A feature at higher binding energy was
noted, labeled O0 1s (531.7 eV), and is typically assigned to
chemisorbed O-containing species, such as –OH or C-
containing species such as CO or CO2 [23]. As outlined in
Table 2, the relative atomic O concentration was found to be
very close to twice the value of the Ce + Zr concentrations. The
Zr/Ce ratios deviated from their bulk values somewhat,
especially in the case of the 10% Zr and 50% Zr samples.
Although the increasing trend of Zr surface concentration is
observed with increasing bulk levels, the change was marginal
from 10% Zr to 25% Zr, and also from 25% Zr to 50% Zr. Two
factors could account for this. One is that, above a certain level,
the zirconia no longer is doped into the ceria surface, but rather
forms islands of a zirconia rich bulk phase. The other possibility
is that a solid solution forms, but that the surface is enriched
with zirconia until a level of 50% Zr doping is achieved.
The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia
was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform
magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for
ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively. In
moving away from the absorber, the ﬁrst major peak
encountered is located at 1.7 A
˚ . This peak is readily assigned
to Zr–O bonds. For the pure ZrO2 sample, the peak in the range
of 3–3.5 A
˚ is assigned to the Zr–Zr coordination in the oxide.
For the two Ce–Zr catalysts, however, there is an additional
peak, which arises at 3.6–3.75 A
˚ . This peak has been assigned
previously to the Zr–Ce interaction, indicative of solid mixing

[5]. The assignment follows from the fact that the peak is quite
intense for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 sample, which would be expected
to exhibit a high degree of Zr–Ce coordination from the 3:1
stoichiometry of Ce/Zr, but much less so for the Ce0.50Zr0.50O2
material, with a stoichiometry of only 1:1. It is strongly
suggested, therefore, from the EXAFS results, that a solid
solution was, to a measurable degree, formed.
It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations
reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data.
The Zr/Ce ratio for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 material was close to the

expected result if a solid solution had formed, as suggested by
EXAFS. On the other hand, for Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, the Zr/Ce ratio
was much less than the expected value for a true solid solution,
and this also correlates with the EXAFS ﬁndings, as the
coordination of Zr to Zr (peak at 3 A
˚ ) was clearly much higher
than Zr to Ce (peak at 3.7 A
˚ ), indicating a lower degree of
mixing.
For ceria-based water–gas shift catalysts, the temperature of
reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature
corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging
OH groups are formed [16]. As described by Yao and Yao [25],
the reduction of ceria typically occurs in two steps. For
unpromoted ceria, the bulk reduction occurs above 750 8C, while
the surface shell reduction step takes place at much lower
temperature (400–550 8C region). We interpret the surface shell
reduction to involve several phenomena [16], including: (1)
liberation of surface carbonates, (2) reduction of Ce surface
atoms from the Ce4+ to the Ce3+ oxidation state, and (3)
formation of bridging OH groups. The latter may occur via
oxygen vacancy generation followed by dissociative adsorption
of H2O. Fig. 3A displays the temperature programmed reduction
(TPR) proﬁles for the binary oxide Ce–Zr materials. As reported
in the literature [26], the bulk reduction step is facilitated by
incorporation of just 10% Zr, as the peak maximum shifts from
about 875 8C for ceria to about 825 8C with doping of zirconia.
Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly
important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two
features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300–400 8C,
increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a
higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C.
Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell
reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of
hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,
resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups.
For example, as displayed in Fig. 3B, for ceria that is not doped
with Zr, 1% Pt addition catalyzes the surface reduction step to
around 225–300 8C. Remarkably, addition of Zr further shifts
this peak to lower temperature, even below 200 8C in the case of
the 25–75% Zr addition range. The peak reaches a limit of about
185 8C for the 25–50% Zr addition range. The peak for zirconia
promoted with 1% Pt occurred in a broader range, with a sharp
peak at 210 8C, and a much broader peak extending up to 400 8C.
To verify that a true facilitation in the reduction of the ceria
component occurred, XANES was employed, and results are
depicted in Fig. 4A and B. A detailed discussion of XANES
proﬁles and reference materials for Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation
states has been provided in our earlier work [16], and will not be
repeated here. Nevertheless, spectra for references of Ce4+ and
Ce3+ oxidation states are provided in Fig. 4C. The Ce4+
oxidation state is characterized by two main peaks, commonly
assigned B1 (lower energy peak) and C (higher energy peak).
During reduction, peak C disappears, and peak B0 develops at a
position slightly lower in energy than B1 [26,27]. Peak B0 is
very intense for pure Ce3+ materials (e.g., cerous carbonate
[16]). After surface shell reduction occurs, a partial change is
realized, and consists of a superimposition of the two states, as
the bulk remains in the Ce4+ oxidation state. Overbury et al.
[26] have demonstrated that Zr addition facilitates both the
temperature and extent of bulk ceria reduction. In our case, we
are primarily interested in whether or not Zr can also facilitate
primarily the temperature of surface shell reduction. It is well-
known that adding the noble metal will reduce virtually the
entire CeO2 surface [27]. Therefore, it is not expected the Zr
would assist in improving the extent of reduction at the surface,
since Zr could remain in the Zr4+ oxidation state to a large
degree. Indeed, as shown by comparison between Fig. 4A and
B, the surface reduction is shifted from about 250 to 200 8C

with addition of Zr. Fig. 4C shows that the white line for Zr does
not deviate much from the Zr4+ oxidation state, though it is well
known that vacancies or their associated bridging OH groups do
in fact form on Zr surfaces [28,29], analogous to those on Ce
[30–32] and Th [33,34].
Moving to the analysis of DRIFTS, Fig. 5A–C show that, after
the surface reduction process, adsorption of CO leads to reaction
with bridging OH groups to produce surface formate bands, in
agreement with earlier studies. There are marked decreases in the
intensity of bridging OH bands (3650 cm1 for ceria-rich phase
and 3700 cm1 for the zirconia-rich phase), and accompanied by
thisdecrease,thereare increasesinC–H bands(2840,2950 cm1
for ceria and 2880, 2970 cm1 for zirconia) and OCO bands
(1580, 1350 cm1 for asymmetric and symmetric, respectively
[35]). The ‘Zr formates’ increase relative to the ‘Ce formates’
with increasing Zr addition, is better shown in the formate C–H
streatching region (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, in agreement with the
XPSdata,thechangeisnotlinear.Only a slightchangeisnotedin
moving from the 25% to 50% Zr loadings, while a more
important change is detected between 50% and 75% Zr. Fig. 5C
shows that the overall intensity of formates decreases as a
function of Zr loading. This follows from the earlier XANES
discussion. Since Zr remains largely Zr4+, there are less defect
sites, and therefore, less bridging OH groups on the surface for
formate formation. Therefore, we cannot expect to increase the
formate intensity by addition of Zr to the surface. However, we
may hope for enhanced hydrogen transfer rates based on the
TPR, or perhaps a different promoting effect on the rate.
Adsorption of CO also provides some indication of the Pt
dispersion. As shown in Fig. 5A, the broad Pt–CO band (1900–
2100 cm1) is similar in intensity among the catalyst samples,
indicating comparable Pt dispersions.
Regarding formate stability, there are several important
ﬁndings of note to date. Formates are quite stable at low
temperature, and they slowly decompose thermally (i.e. in the
absence of H2O) primarily back to CO and –OH [10] (i.e.
reverse formate decomposition). We have found, for example,
that at 240 8C, it takes more than 1 h to decompose the
formates completely (<5% initial value) on 2.5% Pt/ceria. Yet
for 2.5% Pt/ceria, with H2O addition, formates decomposed
completely at 130 8C (110 8C lower temperature) in less than
20 min. Clearly, the formate decomposition is reactant-
promoted by H2O, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Shido
and Iwasawa [10]. Interestingly, changing from Au to Pt, or
increasing the loading of either metal, was found to enhance
the formate decomposition rate further [16,17]. Therefore, the
metal may play a role in increasing the hydrogen abstraction
rate.
As shown in Fig. 6A–E, the formate decomposition rate in
steam is also enhanced by addition of Zr to the Ce. The rate
reaches a maximum at about 50% Zr, and then decreases
again. As shown in Fig. 7A and B, CO2 was evolved during
formate decomposition, but the Pt–CO band did not change
measurably during steam addition. For Pt/ZrO2, the formate
intensity was too low to obtain a quantiﬁable rate during
steaming. Nevertheless, we did stop H2O addition and
rapidly purge with N2 to ﬁnd out how much formate
remained on the surface after 12.2 min (Fig. 6F). While good

The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,
promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped
catalysts. The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/
Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts. It appears, then, that there may be a
correlation between the WGS rate and the formate decomposi-
tion step, as proposed by Shido and Iwasawa [10].
Assuming a ﬁrst order decay of the formate, we estimated
the ﬁrst order rate constant based on 0.15-life (i.e. 85% formate
decomposition) results. The total active sites, based on the
initial formate intensities, decreases with Zr addition (Table 4).
However, the rate of their decomposition, passes through a
maximum at 50% Zr addition. Therefore, the total rate can be
estimated to be proportional to the number of active sites
multiplied by their turnover rate. Ranking the catalysts in this
relative manner, we can see that the total rate reaches a
maximum at 50% Zr addition. The ﬁndings are in agreement
with the trend observed in the WGS rates from ﬁxed bed reactor
tests (an example is provided at 250 8C in Table 4).
We consider three possible explanations for the enhanced
rates observed on the Pt/ceria–zirconia catalysts relative to the
Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia catalysts. First, considering the surface
formate mechanism, there are two possibilities that appear
feasible that could account for enhanced formate decomposi-
tion rates. Considering the original surface formate mechanism
of Shido and Iwasawa [10], coadsorbed H2O promotes the
decomposition rate. Therefore, addition of Zr4+ at the surface of
Pt/ceria (i.e. which is virtually completely reduced at the
surface) would be expected to lead to a lowering in the total

upon reaction of CO with bridging OH groups at defects on the surface of zirconia (3700 cm1), ceria (3650 cm1), or the mixed oxide. Formate bands arising on
the surface indicate that there are two major contributions, surface formates on the ceria-rich surface positioned at approximately 2840 cm1 (2950 cm1) and a
surface formate arising on the zirconia-rich surface positioned at approximately 2880 cm1 (2970 cm1). (B) and (C) After reduction in H2 (100 cm3/min), the 1% Pt

number of defect sites, and therefore, their associated bridging
OH groups. This is, as previously mentioned, reﬂected in the
initial formate intensities upon CO adsorption. However, this in
turn leaves sites open for molecular adsorption of H2O, and
hence, could account for improved formate decomposition
rates. The model is essentially a two-site model, one involving
Ce3+ and one involving Zr4+.
A second possibility is that the hydrogen abstraction rate
may be higher for the zirconia promoted materials. Recently, Pt
clusters were found to facilitate formate decomposition at a rate
of about 20 times that of Au clusters after a similar initial
formate concentration was achieved [17]. The difference was
reﬂected in the relative WGS rates of the Pt materials relative to
Au. Furthermore, increasing Pt or Au loadings led to enhanced
formate decomposition rates, and increased WGS rates.
Therefore, hydrogen abstraction from the formate (and neigh-
boring bridging OH group) could be facilitated by Pt. Judging
by the TPR proﬁles, there may be an improved hydrogen
transfer rate for the ceria–zirconia materials, stemming from
the more facile reduction of the materials.
A third possibility considers a different mechanism, the
ceria-mediated redox model [21,37,38]. In that mechanism, CO
adsorbed on the metal (Pt) reacts with the partially reducible
oxide component at the interface to liberate CO2 and reduce the
Ce4+ to Ce3+. In this proposed scheme, re-oxidation of ceria by
H2O occurs at the vacancies freeing up H2 product. It is
conceivable then, that improved O mobility could facilitate the
reaction rate based on this model. It is important to note that one
basis for the redox model was that formates were not observed
upon CO addition to the reduced ceria surface. Our results are

in striking contrast to those ﬁndings. Recently, it has been
suggested that the feed composition may play a role in
determining which of the two mechanisms may be operating
[39]. We have suggested, based on several studies, including,
among others, isotopic tracer [40,41] and kinetic isotope effect
studies [42,43], that when H2 and H2O are in abundance in the
feed, the traditional formate mechanism [10] appears to be
appropriate. Nevertheless, the redox model [44] also offers an
important basis for future research.
The sensitivity of metal promoted partially reducible
oxides to carbon dioxide is an issue that remains unresolved
[38,45,46]. As pointed out recently by Balakos et al. [47],
excellent water–gas shift catalysts in a feed without carbon
dioxide can exhibit poor activity when appropriate levels of
CO2 are added to the feed. Because there are, reportedly, less
carbonates for materials doped with Zr (see Fig. 8), it is
anticipated that Pt promoted Ce–Zr binary oxides may be
more resistant to the negative effect of carbon dioxide. A
number of switching tests were carried out to probe this
phenomenon (Table 5). Inert balancing gas was used in a feed
containing CO, H2O, and H2, and then it was replaced by an
equivalent amount of CO2, so that the partial pressures of
CO, H2O, and H2 in the feed remained constant, and such that
the total gas velocity remained constant. Comparing at
similar conversion levels, the percentage drop in WGS during
carbon dioxide addition was found to be quite similar among
the catalysts tested (Pt/ceria, Pt/zirconia, and Pt/ceria–
zirconia). As shown in Table 5, the data was recorded away
from the thermodynamic limit. Interestingly, though, after
switching off the carbon dioxide, the Pt/ceria–zirconia
catalyst material displayed about an 8–10% greater recovery,
indicating that the catalyst was less sensitive to irreversible
deactivation by carbon dioxide. This result suggests that CO2
liberation is facilitated by zirconia addition and that this is an
explanation for the higher rate with the incorporation of
lower levels of Zr.
4. Conclusions
A measurable improvement in the water–gas shift rate was
realized by doping zirconium atoms into ceria to form a binary
oxide for Pt promoted catalysts. While addition of zirconia to
ceria decreased the temperature for surface shell reduction of
ceria, as monitored by TPR and XANES, the total number of
defect sites (and their corresponding bridging OH group active
centers) at the surface decreased. The formate decomposition
rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was
found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone. The
overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active
sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom-
position) was found to pass through a maximum. A reasonable
correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates
and the water–gas shift activity, which also passed through a
maximum.
Two types of formates were observed, those associated with
a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion. The
relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the
relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS. XPS further
showed that while increasing the Zr content in general led to
higher Zr levels at the surface, the results did not correlate
directly to the bulk ratios. EXAFS results provided direct
evidence that a solid solution was obtained, as a distinct peak in
the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the Zr–Ce

with increasing Ce/Zr ratio.
The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less
sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide.
However, from a kinetic viewpoint, Pt/ceria, Pt/zirconia, and
Pt/ceria–zirconia catalysts all decreased in CO conversion with
CO2 addition to the feed. The only beneﬁt with Zr addition to
the catalysts appeared when CO2 was switched off, whereby the
catalysts were observed to exhibit a better activity recovery.
