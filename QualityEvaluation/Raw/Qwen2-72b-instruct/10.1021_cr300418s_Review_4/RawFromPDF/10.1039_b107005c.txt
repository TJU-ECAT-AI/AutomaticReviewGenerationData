In situ-EPR, in situ-UV–VIS spectroscopy and on line-GC
have been for the first time simultaneously combined to
follow the behaviour of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane to propene.
Understanding the role of active sites in solid catalysts under
working conditions is a major research goal in heterogeneous
catalysis and a number of spectroscopic techniques have been
adapted in recent years to study solid catalysts during reaction,1
among them UV–VIS diffuse reflectance2,3 and EPR spectros-
copy.4,5 These techniques provide complementary information
on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions (TMI)
during reaction. For example, Cr6+ species are not visible by
EPR but do give rise to intense charge-transfer (CT) transitions
in the UV–VIS spectrum while EPR is able to distinguish
between Cr5+ and Cr3+ sites of different structure.2,6 A similar
situation arises, e.g. for different valence states in vanadia-
based catalysts.7
In this work, both techniques have been for the first time
coupled to each other and to on line-GC to widen the variety of
TMI that can be simultaneously monitored under reaction
conditions. Moreover, this set-up ensures identical reaction
conditions for both spectroscopic techniques that are almost
equal to those usually applied in catalytic tests since a fixed-bed
flow reactor of similar dimensions is used. Thus, limitations in
the comparability of spectroscopic results are eliminated that
otherwise might arise from variations of the reaction conditions
when different in situ-cells are used for separate EPR and UV–
VIS measurements.
Combined in situ-EPR/UV–VIS measurements were per-
formed using a home-made flow reactor4,5 which was imple-
mented in the rectangular cavity of a c.w. spectrometer
ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) operating in X-band. Details of
the flow reactor are described elsewhere.4 Simultaneous UV–
VIS reflectance spectra were recorded by a fibre optics AVS-
PC-2000 plug-in spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a CCD
array detector responsive from 200 to 1100 nm. The two
channels of the spectrometer (master: 200–500 nm; slave:
500–1100 nm) as well as a DH-2000 deuterium-halogen light
source were connected to a cylindrical quartz sensor (Optran
WF, length 200 mm, diameter 1.5 mm) by fibre optic cables
(length 2 m) consisting of a core of pure silica (diameter 0.4
mm) coated with polyimide. The sensor fits into the reactor
through a Teflon sealing disk which is fixed by a screwing at the
top end of the reaction tube. The tip of the sensor is a plane
polished surface and is placed within the catalyst bed. The feed-
through of the thermocouple at the bottom end of the reaction
tube is realized in the same way. For on line product analysis,
the reactor outlet was connected to a GC 17AAF capillary gas
chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a 30 m 3 0.32 mm
Silicaplot column (Chrompack) and a FID. The main features of
the arrangement are schematically displayed in the graphic
contents entry.
This setup has been used to study the dehydrogenation of
propane to propene over two CrOx catalysts: (a) Cr/La,Al2O3
prepared by thermal decomposition of ammonium dawsonite,
NH4Al(OH)2CO3, doped with 10 wt% Cr and 3.9 wt% La and
(b) Cr//La,ZrO2 prepared by impregnating a commercial 7 wt%
La2O3/ZrO2 support (MEL-CAT XZ0681/01, MEL Chemicals)
with an aqueous (NH4)2CrO4 solution to result in a Cr loading
of 0.5 wt% followed by calcination at 873 K.6 Doping by La was
used since La is known to stabilize the Cr species on the
surface.8 The BET surface areas were 345 m2 g21 (Cr/
La,Al2O3) and 104 m2 g21 (Cr//La,ZrO2). In each run, 125 mg
catalyst particles (250–355 mm) were treated in a flow of 23%
C3H8/N2 (W/F = 16.2 g h mol21).
The as-synthesized catalysts contain mainly hexavalent
chromate species evidenced by intense CT bands around 370
nm in the UV–VIS spectra [Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)]9 besides traces of
Cr5+ species that give rise to the very narrow singlet at gA ≈ 1.97
in the EPR spectra [Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)]. The as-synthesized
sample Cr/La,Al2O3 contains also a certain amount of Cr3+
reflected by a broad d–d transition band around 630 nm [Fig.
1(a)].9 Upon heating under feed, the CT bands of chromate
Fig. 1 UV–VIS (a) and EPR (b) spectra alongside propane conversion and
propene selectivity results during heating of the Cr/La,Al2O3 catalyst in a
flow of 23% C2H8/N2. For comparison the UV–VIS spectrum at 810 K in
H2 flow is also shown (thick line).

around 370 nm vanish and d–d bands of Cr3+ appear in the UV–
VIS spectra [Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)]. Simultaneously, the narrow
EPR singlets of Cr5+ disappear and a broad singlet at gA ≈ 2
arises from weakly interacting Cr3+ species [Fig. 1(b) and 2(b)].
By comparing these results with the catalytic data [Fig. 1(c) and
2(c)] it is clearly evident that the reduction of Cr6+ and Cr5+ to
Cr3+ occurs already at temperatures well below the onset of the
dehydrogenation reaction. This information cannot be derived
post mortem from measurements of quenched catalysts and
shows that Cr sites in oxidation states higher than +3 do not
exist under reaction conditions. With increasing time on stream
at 810 K the propane conversion over the Cr/La,ZrO2 catalyst
drops markedly [Fig. 2(c)]. This is due to the partial coverage of
active Cr3+ sites by coke deposits.6 As a consequence, the EPR
singlet of Cr3+ loses intensity since magnetic interaction with
paramagnetic coke species may cause line broadening. In the
UV–VIS spectra, deactivation leads to a gradual increase of
absorbance in the visible range of the spectrum with a maximum
around 470 nm arising from higher condensed carbon species
such as polyaromatics and condensed rings.10
In comparison to sample Cr/La,ZrO2, the Cr/La,Al2O3
catalyst is, despite a higher BET surface area and Cr content,
less active but more stable against deactivation [Fig. 1(c)]. As
for Cr/La,ZrO2, carbon deposits are also formed with increasing
time on stream. However, the maximum of absorbance is
shifted to lower wavelength around 360 nm being characteristic
of less condensed rather linear polyenylic species10 which
might be less deactivating [Fig. 1(a)]. Unfortunately, the d–d
bands of Cr3+ ions and bands of the different carbonaceous
deposites fall partially in the same wavelength range. However,
the contribution of the carbon deposits to the overall absorbance
is readily evident by comparing the UV–VIS spectra at 810 K in
H2 flow [thick line in Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)] reflecting only bands
of reduced Cr species with those in propane/N2 flow. The latter
show higher absorbance even at 620 K when propane
conversion is still below the detection limit. This suggests that
carbon deposits start to form quite early but probably need to
exceed a certain polymerization degree to become deactivating.
Again, this is a result that cannot be obtained from ex situ-
measurements of deactivated catalysts. The lower activity of the
Cr/La,Al2O3 catalyst is most probably due to the fact that most
of the Cr ions are incorporated in Al lattice positions of the
catalyst bulk and, thus, not accessible by reactants. This is also
supported by XPS measurements that reveal a markedly lower
Cr concentration on the surface than in the bulk already for the
as-synthesized catalyst which is expected to decrease even more
upon reduction during time on stream. This behaviour is well
known for Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.9 In contrast to Cr/La,ZrO2
catalysts8 this obviously can not markedly be prevented by
doping with La.
The obtained results demonstrate that the simultaneous
coupling of in situ-EPR/UV–VIS/on-line-GC is a powerful new
tool to follow the reaction-dependent interconversion of
different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behaviour of
CrOx catalysts.
