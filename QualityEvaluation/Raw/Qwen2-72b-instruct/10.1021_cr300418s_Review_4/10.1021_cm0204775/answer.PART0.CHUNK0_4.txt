1.The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been comprehensively characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS, EXAFS, and TPR. High-resolution XRD studies confirm the formation of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ with 6% oxide ion vacancy. TEM images reveal very few Pt particles on the CeO2 surface, and the density of Pt metal particles decreases upon heating. XPS studies show that Pt is mostly in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with only 7% present as Pt metal particles. EXAFS studies indicate an average coordination number of 1.3 around the platinum ion at a distance of 1.98 Å, suggesting oxide ion vacancy. Upon heating, the average oxygen coordination of Pt increases to 2.3. The second shell at 2.97 Å is attributed to PtPt coordination, which is not observed in PtO2 and PtO. The third shell at 3.28 Å, not observed in Pt metal or platinum oxides, is attributed to Pt2+Ce4+ correlation. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the chemical state, coordination environment, and distribution of Pt in the catalyst, thus ruling out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity.

1.通过XRD、TEM、XPS、EXAFS和TPR等综合表征方法，对燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2催化剂中Pt的结构和化学性质进行了全面的表征。高分辨率XRD研究证实了Ce1-xPtxO2-δ的形成，其中含有6%的氧离子空位。TEM图像显示，在制备样品的CeO2表面存在非常少的Pt颗粒，加热后Pt金属颗粒的密度降低。XPS研究表明，Pt主要以+2和+4氧化态存在，只有7%以Pt金属颗粒的形式存在。EXAFS研究表明，1% Pt/CeO2中铂离子周围第一壳层的平均配位数为1.3，距离为1.98 Å，表明铂离子周围存在氧离子空位。加热后，Pt的平均氧配位数增加到2.3。第二壳层在2.97 Å处，归因于PtPt配位，这在PtO2和PtO中没有观察到。第三壳层在3.28 Å处，在Pt金属或铂氧化物中均未观察到，归因于Pt2+Ce4+相关性。这些技术通过提供有关催化剂中Pt的化学状态、配位环境和分布的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，从而排除了对观察到的催化活性的其他解释。
