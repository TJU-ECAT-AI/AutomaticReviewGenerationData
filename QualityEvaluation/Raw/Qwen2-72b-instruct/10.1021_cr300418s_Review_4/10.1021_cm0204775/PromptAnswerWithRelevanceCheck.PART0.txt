1.The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been comprehensively characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR). High-resolution XRD studies show that the structure could be refined for the composition of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in the fluorite structure with 6% oxide ion vacancy. TEM images reveal very few Pt particles on the CeO2 crystallite surface in as-prepared samples, and a decrease in the density of Pt metal particles is observed on heating.

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the chemical state, coordination environment, and dispersion of the dopant, as well as the structural properties of the support. They rule out alternative explanations by confirming the specific chemical nature and distribution of the dopant, as well as the absence of other phases or structures that could affect catalytic activity.

1.通过X射线衍射(XRD)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)和温度编程反应(TPR)对燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2催化剂中Pt的结构和化学性质进行了全面的表征。高分辨率XRD研究表明，结构可以精炼为Ce1-xPtxO2-δ的萤石结构，其中含有6%的氧离子空位。TEM图像显示，在制备样品中CeO2晶粒表面几乎没有Pt颗粒，加热后Pt金属颗粒的密度降低。XPS研究表明，Pt主要以+2(72%)和+4(21%)氧化态分散在CeO2上，而只有7%以Pt金属颗粒的形式存在。EXAFS研究表明，在1% Pt/CeO2的第一壳层中，铂离子周围的平均配位数为1.3，距离为1.98 Å，表明铂离子周围存在氧离子空位。加热后，Pt和氧的平均氧配位数增加到2.3。第二壳层在2.97 Å处，是由于PtPt配位，这在PtO2和PtO中是不存在的。第三壳层在3.28 Å处，在Pt金属或任何铂氧化物中均未观察到，这可能归因于Pt2+Ce4+相关性。这些技术通过提供有关掺杂剂的化学状态、配位环境和分散性以及支撑结构的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。它们通过确认掺杂剂的特定化学性质和分布，以及不存在可能影响催化活性的其他相或结构，排除了其他解释。

These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the structure, chemical nature, and coordination environment of the dopants. For instance, high-resolution XRD studies can refine the structure of the doped catalyst, revealing the presence of oxide ion vacancy. TEM images can show the distribution and size of the dopant particles, while XPS can determine the oxidation states of the dopants. EXAFS can provide information on the coordination environment of the dopants, indicating the presence of unique correlations not observed in other materials. These techniques collectively rule out alternative explanations by confirming the formation of a solid solution with specific linkages between the dopant and the support.
