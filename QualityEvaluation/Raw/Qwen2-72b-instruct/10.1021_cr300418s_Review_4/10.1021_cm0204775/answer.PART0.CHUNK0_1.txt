1.The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated using a comprehensive set of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR). These methods provide a detailed understanding of the catalyst's composition, structure, and chemical state. High-resolution XRD studies have shown that the structure can be refined for the composition of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in the fluorite structure, indicating the presence of oxide ion vacancy. TEM images reveal very few Pt particles on the CeO2 crystallite surface in as-prepared samples, and a decrease in the density of Pt metal particles is observed upon heating. XPS studies demonstrate that Pt is predominantly in the +2 and +4 oxidation states on CeO2, with only a small fraction present as Pt metal particles. EXAFS studies show an average coordination number of 1.3 around the platinum ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.98 Å, indicating oxide ion vacancy around the platinum ion. Upon heating, the average oxygen coordination of Pt and oxygen increases to 2.3. The second shell at 2.97 Å is attributed to PtPt coordination, which is not observed in PtO2 and PtO. The third shell at 3.28 Å, not observed in Pt metal or any of the platinum oxides, is attributed to Pt2+Ce4+ correlation. These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the catalyst's composition, structure, and chemical state, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior.

1.通过一系列全面的技术，包括X射线衍射(XRD)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)和温度编程反应(TPR)，对燃烧合成的Pt/CeO2催化剂中Pt的结构和化学性质进行了研究。这些方法为催化剂的组成、结构和化学状态提供了详细的了解。高分辨率XRD研究表明，结构可以精炼为Ce1-xPtxO2-δ在萤石结构中的组成，表明存在氧化离子空位。TEM图像显示，在制备样品中，CeO2晶粒表面的Pt粒子非常少，加热后Pt金属粒子的密度降低。XPS研究表明，Pt主要以+2和+4氧化态存在于CeO2上，只有少量以Pt金属粒子的形式存在。EXAFS研究表明，铂离子在第一壳层中的平均配位数为1.3，距离为1.98 Å，表明铂离子周围存在氧化离子空位。加热后，Pt和氧的平均氧配位数增加到2.3。第二壳层在2.97 Å处，归因于PtPt配位，这在PtO2和PtO中没有观察到。第三壳层在3.28 Å处，在Pt金属或任何铂氧化物中均未观察到，归因于Pt2+Ce4+相关性。这些技术集体通过提供关于催化剂组成、结构和化学状态的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，这对于理解催化行为至关重要。
