[1] "The structure and chemical nature of Pt in combustion-synthesized Pt/CeO2 catalysts have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR)."
[2] "High-resolution XRD studies show that the structure could be refined for the composition of Ce1-xPtxO2-δ in the fluorite structure with 6% oxide ion vacancy."
[3] "TEM images show very few Pt particles on the CeO2 crystallite surface in as-prepared samples and a decrease in the density of Pt metal particles is observed on heating."
[4] "XPS studies demonstrate that Pt is dispersed mostly in +2 (72%) and +4 (21%) oxidation states on CeO2, whereas only 7% is present as Pt metal particles."
[5] "EXAFS studies show the average coordination number of 1.3 around the platinum ion in the first shell of 1% Pt/CeO2 at a distance of 1.98 Å, indicating oxide ion vacancy around the platinum ion."
[6] "On heating, the average oxygen coordination of Pt and oxygen increases to 2.3."
[7] "The second shell at 2.97 Å is due to PtPt coordination, which is absent in PtO2 and PtO."
[8] "The third shell at 3.28 Å is not observed either in Pt metal or any of the platinum oxides, which could be attributed to Pt2+Ce4+ correlation."
[9] "Thus, Pt/CeO2 forms a Ce1-xPtxO2-δ type of solid solution having Pt2+OCe4+ kinds of linkages."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and temperature-programmed reaction (TPR). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the structure, chemical nature, and coordination environment of the dopants. For instance, high-resolution XRD studies can refine the structure of the doped catalyst, revealing the presence of oxide ion vacancy. TEM images can show the distribution and size of the dopant particles, while XPS can determine the oxidation states of the dopants. EXAFS can provide information on the coordination environment of the dopants, indicating the presence of unique correlations not observed in other materials. These techniques collectively rule out alternative explanations by confirming the formation of a solid solution with specific linkages between the dopant and the support.
