1.The literature does not provide specific details on the characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention the use of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) to determine the chemical composition and surface composition of the catalysts, respectively. These techniques help in establishing a relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing information on the bulk and surface composition of the catalysts. The literature also discusses the effect of calcination temperature and impurities on the catalytic performance, which can be considered as part of the comprehensive characterization approach to rule out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供用于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的具体表征方法和分析方法的详细信息。但是，它确实提到了使用X射线荧光（XRF）和低能离子散射（LEIS）来确定催化剂的化学成分和表面成分。这些技术通过提供催化剂的体相和表面成分信息，有助于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间的关系。文献还讨论了煅烧温度和杂质对催化性能的影响，这可以被认为是全面表征方法的一部分，以排除对观察到的催化活性的其他解释。
