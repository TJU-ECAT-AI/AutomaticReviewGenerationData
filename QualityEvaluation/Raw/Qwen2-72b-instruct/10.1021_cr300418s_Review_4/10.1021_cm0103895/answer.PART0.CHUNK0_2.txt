[1] "XRD data of Pd/CeO2 catalyst materials for Rietveld refinement were collected on a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with a rotating anode with CuKα1 radiation (1.54059 Å) having a graphite-crystal monochromator."
[2] "XPS of these materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) with AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
[3] "Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra in catalyst and reference samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode by using synchrotron radiation with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at BL01B1 beamline in Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8), Japan."
[4] "EXAFS data were analyzed by using the UWXAFS program, 35 which uses the criteria of good background removal, optimization of low R portion of the EXAFS data, and Fourier transform to R space."
[5] "In principle, the EXAFS function χ(k) is defined by the relation where μ and μo are the characteristic atomic absorption coefficients of the atom in the material of interest and in the isolated state, respectively, both of which are functions of k, which is wave vector of photoelectron ejected as a consequence of X-ray absorption."
[6] "The theoretical calculations of backscattering amplitude and phase-shift functions were obtained by using the FEFF (6.01) program."
[7] "The experimental EXAFS data were fitted with the theoretical EXAFS function by using the FEFFIT (2.5 d) program."
[8] "From this analysis structural parameters such as coordination numbers (N), bond distance (R), and DebyeWaller factor (σ) were calculated."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. XRD provides information on the crystalline structure and phase purity, XPS reveals the chemical state and oxidation level of elements, and EXAFS offers insights into the local structure around the dopant atoms. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed structural and chemical information. They rule out alternative explanations by confirming the absence of secondary phases or aggregates that could contribute to catalytic activity independently of the dopant.

1.验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。XRD提供了晶体结构和相纯度的信息，XPS揭示了元素的化学状态和氧化水平，而EXAFS提供了掺杂原子周围局部结构的见解。这些技术通过提供详细的结构和化学信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战。它们通过确认不存在可能独立于掺杂剂对催化活性做出贡献的二次相或聚集体，排除了其他解释。
