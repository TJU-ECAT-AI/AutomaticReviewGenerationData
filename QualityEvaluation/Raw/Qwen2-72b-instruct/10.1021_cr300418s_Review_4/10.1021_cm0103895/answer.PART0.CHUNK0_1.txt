[1] "XRD data of Pd/CeO2 catalyst materials for Rietveld refinement were collected on a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with a rotating anode with CuKα1 radiation (1.54059 Å) having a graphite-crystal monochromator."
[2] "XPS of these materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) with AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
[3] "Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra in catalyst and reference samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode by using synchrotron radiation with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at BL01B1 beamline in Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8), Japan."
[4] "EXAFS data were analyzed by using the UWXAFS program, 35 which uses the criteria of good background removal, optimization of low R portion of the EXAFS data, and Fourier transform to R space."
[5] "The theoretical calculations of backscattering amplitude and phase-shift functions were obtained by using the FEFF (6.01) program."
[6] "The experimental EXAFS data were fitted with the theoretical EXAFS function by using the FEFFIT (2.5 d) program."
[7] "From this analysis structural parameters such as coordination numbers (N), bond distance (R), and DebyeWaller factor (σ) were calculated."
[8] "XPS studies show that Pd is in a highly ionic Pd2+ state in 1 at. % Pd/CeO2."
[9] "EXAFS analysis proves that Pd2+ ions are substituted for Ce4+ sites with oxide ion vacancy around Pd2+ ion."
[10] "The Pd2+ ion is stabilized in the Ce4+ site leading to a strong PdCeO2 interaction in the form of Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution with Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the document include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XRD provides information on the crystalline structure and phase purity, XPS gives insights into the chemical state and oxidation level of the elements, and EXAFS offers details on the local atomic environment and coordination geometry. These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing a detailed understanding of the material's structure at various scales, from long-range order to local atomic arrangements. They also help in ruling out alternative explanations by confirming the substitution of dopants into the host lattice and the formation of specific chemical bonds, such as Pd2+O2-Ce4+ linkages, which are crucial for the observed catalytic activity.
