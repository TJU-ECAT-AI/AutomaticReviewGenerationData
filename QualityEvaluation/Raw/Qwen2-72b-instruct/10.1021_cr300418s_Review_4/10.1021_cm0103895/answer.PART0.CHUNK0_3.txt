[1] "XRD data of Pd/CeO2 catalyst materials for Rietveld refinement were collected on a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with a rotating anode with CuKα1 radiation (1.54059 Å) having a graphite-crystal monochromator."
[2] "XPS of these materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) with AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
[3] "Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra in catalyst and reference samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode by using synchrotron radiation with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at BL01B1 beamline in Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8), Japan."
[4] "EXAFS data were analyzed by using the UWXAFS program, 35 which uses the criteria of good background removal, optimization of low R portion of the EXAFS data, and Fourier transform to R space."
[5] "Theoretical calculations of backscattering amplitude and phase-shift functions were obtained by using the FEFF (6.01) program."
[6] "The experimental EXAFS data were fitted with the theoretical EXAFS function by using the FEFFIT (2.5 d) program."
[7] "From this analysis structural parameters such as coordination numbers (N), bond distance (R), and DebyeWaller factor (σ) were calculated."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These techniques provide detailed information on the structure, chemical state, and local environment of the dopants in the metal oxide catalysts. XRD with Rietveld refinement allows for the determination of the crystal structure and lattice parameters, XPS provides insights into the oxidation state and chemical environment of the elements, and EXAFS spectroscopy offers information on the coordination numbers, bond distances, and the Debye-Waller factor, which are crucial for understanding the local structure around the dopants. These methods collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing a comprehensive view of the catalyst's structure and composition, thus ruling out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity.

1.在研究中使用的综合表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)与Rietveld精修、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。这些技术提供了金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂结构、化学状态和局部环境的详细信息。XRD与Rietveld精修允许确定晶体结构和晶格参数，XPS提供了元素氧化态和化学环境的见解，而EXAFS光谱提供了配位数、键长和德拜-瓦勒因子的信息，这对于理解掺杂剂周围的局部结构至关重要。这些方法共同解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，通过提供催化剂结构和组成的全面视图，从而排除了催化活性观察到的替代解释。
