[1] "XRD data of Pd/CeO2 catalyst materials for Rietveld refinement were collected on a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with a rotating anode with CuKα1 radiation (1.54059 Å) having a graphite-crystal monochromator."
[2] "XPS of these materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) with AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
[3] "Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra in catalyst and reference samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode by using synchrotron radiation with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at BL01B1 beamline in Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8), Japan."
[4] "EXAFS data were analyzed by using the UWXAFS program, 35 which uses the criteria of good background removal, optimization of low R portion of the EXAFS data, and Fourier transform to R space."
[5] "In principle, the EXAFS function χ(k) is defined by the relation where μ and μo are the characteristic atomic absorption coefficients of the atom in the material of interest and in the isolated state, respectively, both of which are functions of k, which is wave vector of photoelectron ejected as a consequence of X-ray absorption."
[6] "The theoretical calculations of backscattering amplitude and phase-shift functions were obtained by using the FEFF (6.01) program."
[7] "The experimental EXAFS data were fitted with the theoretical EXAFS function by using the FEFFIT (2.5 d) program."
[8] "From this analysis structural parameters such as coordination numbers (N), bond distance (R), and DebyeWaller factor (σ) were calculated."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the local structure, chemical environment, and coordination of the dopant atoms. XRD provides information on the long-range order and phase purity, XPS reveals the chemical state and oxidation level of the dopants, and EXAFS offers insights into the local atomic arrangement around the dopant atoms. These techniques collectively rule out alternative explanations by confirming the substitution of dopants into the metal oxide lattice and the absence of secondary phases or surface segregation.

1.验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的关键综合表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。这些技术通过提供掺杂原子的局部结构、化学环境和配位的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。XRD提供了长程有序和相纯度的信息，XPS揭示了掺杂剂的化学状态和氧化水平，而EXAFS提供了掺杂原子周围局部原子排列的见解。这些技术集体通过确认掺杂剂在金属氧化物晶格中的替代以及排除二次相或表面分离的存在，排除了其他解释。
