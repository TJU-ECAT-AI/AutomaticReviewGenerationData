1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. XRD was performed using a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation, XPS was conducted with AlKα radiation, and EXAFS was recorded using synchrotron radiation at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute. EXAFS data were analyzed using the UWXAFS program, which involves background removal, optimization of the low R portion of the data, and Fourier transform to R space. The EXAFS function χ(k) was defined based on the atomic absorption coefficients, and the data were fitted using the FEFFIT program. The analysis allowed for the calculation of structural parameters such as coordination numbers, bond distances, and Debye-Waller factors. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the local structure and chemical environment of the dopants, thus ruling out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity.
