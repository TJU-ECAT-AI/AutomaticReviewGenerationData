[1] "XRD data of Pd/CeO2 catalyst materials for Rietveld refinement were collected on a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with a rotating anode with CuKα1 radiation (1.54059 Å) having a graphite-crystal monochromator."
[2] "XPS of these materials were recorded in an ESCA-3 Mark II spectrometer (VG Scientific Ltd., England) with AlKα radiation (1486.6 eV)."
[3] "Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra in catalyst and reference samples were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode by using synchrotron radiation with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator at BL01B1 beamline in Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (SPring-8), Japan."
[4] "EXAFS data were analyzed by using the UWXAFS program, 35 which uses the criteria of good background removal, optimization of low R portion of the EXAFS data, and Fourier transform to R space."
[5] "In principle, the EXAFS function χ(k) is defined by the relation where μ and μo are the characteristic atomic absorption coefficients of the atom in the material of interest and in the isolated state, respectively, both of which are functions of k, which is wave vector of photoelectron ejected as a consequence of X-ray absorption."
[6] "The theoretical calculations of backscattering amplitude and phase-shift functions were obtained by using the FEFF (6.01) program."
[7] "The experimental EXAFS data were fitted with the theoretical EXAFS function by using the FEFFIT (2.5 d) program."
[8] "From this analysis structural parameters such as coordination numbers (N), bond distance (R), and DebyeWaller factor (σ) were calculated."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. XRD was performed using a Rigaku-2000 diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation, XPS was conducted with AlKα radiation, and EXAFS was recorded using synchrotron radiation at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute. EXAFS data were analyzed using the UWXAFS program, which involves background removal, optimization of the low R portion of the data, and Fourier transform to R space. The EXAFS function χ(k) was defined based on the atomic absorption coefficients, and the data were fitted using the FEFFIT program. The analysis allowed for the calculation of structural parameters such as coordination numbers, bond distances, and Debye-Waller factors. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the local structure and chemical environment of the dopants, thus ruling out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity.

1.本研究中采用的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)光谱。XRD使用Rigaku-2000衍射仪和CuKα1辐射进行，XPS使用AlKα辐射进行，EXAFS使用日本同步辐射研究所的同步辐射进行。EXAFS数据使用UWXAFS程序进行分析，该程序涉及背景消除、EXAFS数据低R部分的优化以及R空间的傅立叶变换。EXAFS函数χ(k)基于原子吸收系数定义，数据使用FEFFIT程序进行拟合。分析允许计算结构参数，如配位数、键长和德拜-瓦勒因子。这些技术通过提供掺杂剂的局部结构和化学环境的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，从而排除了催化活性的其他解释。
