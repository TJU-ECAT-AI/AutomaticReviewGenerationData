[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
[2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."
[3] "The structure could be refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ (x = 0.03 and 0.05; δ  0.13 and 0.16) in the fluorite structure with 58% oxide ion vacancy."
[4] "High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2."
[5] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
[6] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
[7] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
[8] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."

1.The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been thoroughly investigated using a variety of techniques. High-resolution XRD studies did not reveal any CuO lines, indicating the absence of a CuO phase. The structure was refined for the composition Ce1-xCuxO2-δ in the fluorite structure with a significant oxide ion vacancy. High-resolution TEM also did not show any CuO particles. EPR and XPS studies confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix. EXAFS investigations showed an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell, indicating an O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length was found to be shorter than in CuO. The second and third shells around the Cu2+ ion were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ correlations, respectively. These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. They address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the local structure and chemical environment of the dopants, while ruling out alternative explanations such as the presence of separate CuO phases.

1.通过多种技术对通过溶液燃烧方法合成的Cu/CeO2催化剂中Cu的结构和化学环境进行了全面研究。高分辨率XRD研究没有显示出任何CuO线，表明不存在CuO相。结构被精炼为Ce1-xCuxO2-δ的组成，在萤石结构中具有显著的氧化离子空位。高分辨率TEM也没有显示出任何CuO颗粒。EPR和XPS研究证实了CeO2基质中存在Cu2+物种。EXAFS研究显示Cu2+离子第一壳层周围平均配位数为3，表明Cu2+离子周围存在O2-离子空位。发现CuO键长比CuO中的短。Cu2+离子周围的第二和第三壳层分别归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+和Cu2+O2-Ce4+相关性。这些全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。它们通过提供有关掺杂剂局部结构和化学环境的详细信息，同时排除其他解释，如存在单独的CuO相，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战。
