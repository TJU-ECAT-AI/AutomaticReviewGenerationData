[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
[2] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
[3] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
[4] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."

1.The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO. The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively. The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages. These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts, and they address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.

1.通过X射线衍射(XRD)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、电子顺磁共振(EPR)光谱、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、循环伏安法(CV)和扩展X射线精细结构(EXAFS)光谱等方法，研究了通过溶液燃烧法合成的Cu/CeO2催化剂中Cu的结构和化学环境。EXAFS研究显示，Cu2+离子第一壳层的平均配位数为3，距离为1.96 Å，表明Cu2+离子周围存在O2-离子空位。与CuO中的CuO键长相比，CuO键长也有所减小。催化剂中Cu2+离子的第二和第三壳层分别归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+的2.92 Å和Cu2+O2-Ce4+的3.15 Å。现有结果为形成具有Cu2+OCe4+类型的Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固溶体相提供了直接证据。这些全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要，它们解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。
