[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."

1.The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been comprehensively investigated using a variety of techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy were employed to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of Cu dopants in the CeO2 matrix. EXAFS studies revealed an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the presence of O2- ion vacancies around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length was found to be shorter than in CuO, and the second and third shells around the Cu2+ ion were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at 3.15 Å, respectively. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages, addressing the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.

1.通过溶液燃烧法合成的Cu/CeO2催化剂中Cu的结构和化学环境已经通过多种技术进行了全面研究，以验证Cu掺杂剂在CeO2基质中的成功掺入和均匀分布。使用X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）光谱、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、循环伏安法（CV）和扩展X射线精细结构（EXAFS）光谱来确认Cu掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布。EXAFS研究表明，在第一壳层中Cu2+离子周围平均配位数为3，距离为1.96 Å，表明Cu2+离子周围存在O2-离子空位。发现CuO键长比CuO中的短，Cu2+离子周围的第二和第三壳层分别归因于2.92 Å的Cu2+O2-Cu2+和3.15 Å的Cu2+O2-Ce4+。这些结果为形成具有Cu2+OCe4+连接的Ce1-xCuxO2-δ型固溶相提供了直接证据，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。
