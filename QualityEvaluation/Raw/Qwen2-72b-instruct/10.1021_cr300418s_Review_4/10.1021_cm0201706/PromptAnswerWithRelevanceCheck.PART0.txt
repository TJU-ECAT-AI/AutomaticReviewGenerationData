1.The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been thoroughly investigated using a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods have confirmed the absence of CuO in the catalysts, the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix, and the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages. The EXAFS data show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion. The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO, and the second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively.

1.通过使用X射线衍射(XRD)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、电子顺磁共振(EPR)光谱、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、循环伏安法(CV)和扩展X射线精细结构(EXAFS)光谱等技术，对通过溶液燃烧法合成的Cu/CeO2催化剂中Cu的结构和化学环境进行了全面研究。这些方法证实了催化剂中不存在CuO，CeO2基质中存在Cu2+物种，以及形成了具有Cu2+OCe4+键合的Ce1-xCuxO2-δ型固溶体相。EXAFS数据显示，在第一壳层中，Cu2+离子周围平均配位数为3，距离为1.96 Å，表明Cu2+离子周围存在O2-离子空位。与CuO中的CuO键长相比，CuO键长也有所减小，Cu2+离子在催化剂中的第二和第三壳层分别归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+在2.92 Å和Cu2+O2-Ce4+在3.15 Å的距离。这些全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要，它们解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。

These methods have been crucial in verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of Cu dopants in the CeO2 matrix. High-resolution XRD and TEM studies did not show the presence of CuO, confirming that Cu is incorporated into the CeO2 lattice rather than existing as a separate phase. EPR and XPS studies confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix, indicating that Cu is not present as CuO. EXAFS investigations provided detailed information about the local structure around Cu2+ ions, showing an average coordination number of 3 at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating oxide ion vacancies around Cu2+ ions. The CuO bond length in the catalysts was found to be shorter than in CuO, and the second and third shells around Cu2+ ions were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ correlations at distances of 2.92 Å and 3.15 Å, respectively. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages, which is crucial for understanding the enhanced catalytic performance of these materials.
