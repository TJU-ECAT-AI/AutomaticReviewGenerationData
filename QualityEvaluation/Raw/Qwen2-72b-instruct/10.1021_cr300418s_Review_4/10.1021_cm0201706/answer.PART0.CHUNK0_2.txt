1.The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been thoroughly investigated using a variety of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods have been crucial in verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of Cu dopants in the CeO2 matrix. High-resolution XRD and TEM studies did not show the presence of CuO, confirming that Cu is incorporated into the CeO2 lattice rather than existing as a separate phase. EPR and XPS studies confirmed the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix, indicating that Cu is not present as CuO. EXAFS investigations provided detailed information about the local structure around Cu2+ ions, showing an average coordination number of 3 at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating oxide ion vacancies around Cu2+ ions. The CuO bond length in the catalysts was found to be shorter than in CuO, and the second and third shells around Cu2+ ions were attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ correlations at distances of 2.92 Å and 3.15 Å, respectively. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ solid solution phase with Cu2+OCe4+ linkages, which is crucial for understanding the enhanced catalytic performance of these materials.

1.通过溶液燃烧法合成的Cu/CeO2催化剂中Cu的结构和化学环境已经通过X射线衍射(XRD)、透射电子显微镜(TEM)、电子顺磁共振(EPR)光谱、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、循环伏安法(CV)和扩展X射线精细结构(EXAFS)光谱等技术进行了全面研究。这些方法对于验证Cu掺杂剂在CeO2基质中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。高分辨率XRD和TEM研究没有显示出CuO的存在，证实Cu被掺入CeO2晶格中，而不是作为独立相存在。EPR和XPS研究确认了CeO2基质中存在Cu2+物种，表明Cu不是以CuO的形式存在。EXAFS研究提供了关于Cu2+离子周围局部结构的详细信息，显示在1.96 Å的距离处平均配位数为3，表明Cu2+离子周围存在氧化物离子空位。催化剂中的CuO键长被发现比CuO中的短，Cu2+离子的第二和第三壳层分别归因于Cu2+O2-Cu2+和Cu2+O2-Ce4+相关性，距离分别为2.92 Å和3.15 Å。这些结果为Ce1-xCuxO2-δ固体溶液相的形成提供了直接证据，具有Cu2+OCe4+连接，这对于理解这些材料的增强催化性能至关重要。
