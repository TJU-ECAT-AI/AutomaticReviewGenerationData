1. The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (SEM/HRTEM), BET surface area analysis, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. They address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. XRD and SEM/HRTEM provide structural and morphological information, while BET analysis gives insights into surface area changes. H2-TPR and XPS help understand the chemical environment and interaction between the dopant and the host metal, and O2-TPD reveals the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species. These techniques collectively rule out alternative explanations by confirming the presence of a strong interaction between Ni and Zr, which plays a significant role in the lessened reducibility and the distribution of adsorbed oxygen species, ultimately influencing the catalytic performance.

1. 本研究中使用的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、扫描/高分辨率透射电子显微镜(SEM/HRTEM)、BET表面积分析、H2温度程序还原(H2-TPR)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和O2温度程序脱附(O2-TPD)。这些技术对于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。它们通过提供催化剂的物理和化学性质的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。XRD和SEM/HRTEM提供了结构和形态信息，而BET分析给出了表面积变化的见解。H2-TPR和XPS有助于理解掺杂剂和宿主金属之间的化学环境和相互作用，而O2-TPD揭示了吸附氧物种的分布。这些技术集体通过确认Ni和Zr之间存在强烈的相互作用，这种相互作用在降低还原性和吸附氧物种的分布中起着重要作用，最终影响催化性能，从而排除了其他解释。
