[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."
[2] "The characterization results indicated that cerium doping could deform the spinel structure and cause redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states; consequently, they would increase crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and thus increase the catalytic performance of cerium modified cobalt chromite catalysts."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS), and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the catalyst's structure, composition, and surface properties. They help rule out alternative explanations by confirming the deformation of the spinel structure, redistribution of metal ions with different oxidation states, and the increase in crystal defects and oxygen vacancy concentration, which facilitate oxygen mobility and enhance catalytic performance.

1. 验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、拉曼光谱、BET、扫描电子显微镜(SEM)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、温度程序还原质谱(CH4 TPR-MS)和温度程序脱附氧(O2-TPD)。这些技术通过提供催化剂结构、组成和表面性质的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间明确关系的挑战。它们通过确认尖晶石结构的变形、具有不同氧化态的金属离子的重新分布以及晶体缺陷和氧空位浓度的增加，从而促进氧的流动性并增强催化性能，从而排除了其他解释。
