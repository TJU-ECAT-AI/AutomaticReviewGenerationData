[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
[2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
[3] "The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon."
[4] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples calcined at temperatures lower than 700 C showed only reflections corresponding to the tetragonal phase."
[5] "The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples; only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflections corresponding to the monoclinic phase."
[6] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[7] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

1. The sol-gel method is crucial for the preparation of metallic catalysts as it allows for the mixing of constituents at an atomic scale, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. The crystalline phase obtained by this method depends on the starting metallic precursor. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the influence of the doping metal on the morphology of the gel particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples. The textural analysis of the catalysts reveals the specific areas and pore sizes, which can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure during catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia, with its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase, shows the best performance in catalytic tests, resisting high concentrations of trichloroethylene.
