1. The sol-gel method is used for the preparation of metallic catalysts because it allows for mixing at the atomic scale, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. The crystalline phase obtained by this method depends on the starting metallic precursor. The morphology of the gel particles is influenced by the nature of the doping metal, which can be observed through scanning electron microscopy. Textural properties of the catalysts are studied through nitrogen sorption isotherms. X-ray diffraction patterns and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are also used to characterize the samples. The catalytic activity tests show that the tetragonal phase of zirconia stabilized by lanthanum and iron doping agents significantly improves the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene.

1. 溶胶-凝胶方法用于制备金属催化剂，因为它允许在原子尺度上混合，从而在支撑上均匀分布活性金属。通过这种方法获得的结晶相取决于起始金属前体。凝胶颗粒的形态受掺杂金属性质的影响，这可以通过扫描电子显微镜观察到。催化剂的纹理性质通过氮气吸附等温线研究。X射线衍射图案和傅里叶变换红外光谱也用于表征样品。催化活性测试表明，由镧和铁掺杂剂稳定化的锆酸盐的四方相显著提高了三氯乙烯的催化燃烧。
