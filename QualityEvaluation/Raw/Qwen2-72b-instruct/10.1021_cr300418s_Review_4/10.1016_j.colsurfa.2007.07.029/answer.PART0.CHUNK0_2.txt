1.The sol-gel method is widely used for the preparation of metallic catalysts because it allows for mixing at the atomic scale, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. The crystalline phase obtained by this method is determined by the starting metallic precursor. The morphology of the gel particles is influenced by the nature of the doping metal, which can be observed through scanning electron microscopy. The textural properties of the catalysts are studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to analyze the samples treated at different temperatures. The catalytic activity tests demonstrate that the ZrO2 tetragonal phase stabilized by La, Fe doping agents significantly improves the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene.

1.溶胶-凝胶法因其能在原子尺度上混合，使活性金属在支撑体上均匀分布，因此在金属催化剂的制备中受到广泛关注。通过这种方法获得的结晶相由起始金属前体决定。凝胶颗粒的形态受掺杂金属性质的影响，这可以通过扫描电子显微镜观察到。催化剂的纹理性质通过在77 K下测量的N2吸附等温线进行研究。X射线衍射(XRD)图案用于分析在不同温度下处理的样品。催化活性测试表明，由La，Fe掺杂剂稳定化的ZrO2四方相显著提高了三氯乙烯的催化燃烧性能。
