[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
[2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
[3] "The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon."
[4] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples calcined at temperatures lower than 700 C showed only reflections corresponding to the tetragonal phase."
[5] "The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples;only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflections corresponding to the monoclinic phase."
[6] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[7] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

1. The sol-gel method is crucial for preparing metallic catalysts because it allows mixing of constituents at the atomic scale, ensuring a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to determine the crystalline phase, which depends on the starting metallic precursor. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed to observe the influence of the doping metal on the morphology of the gel particles. XRD patterns at different calcination temperatures reveal the presence of tetragonal and monoclinic phases, with the La-Mn doped zirconia showing the monoclinic phase at 800°C. Textural analysis through nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K reveals low specific surface areas but large cavity sizes that facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure during catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia, with its dominant tetragonal phase, exhibits the best catalytic performance under high concentrations of trichloroethylene.

1. 溶胶-凝胶法对于制备金属催化剂至关重要，因为它允许在原子尺度上混合组分，确保活性金属在支撑体上的均匀分布。X射线衍射（XRD）用于确定结晶相，这取决于起始金属前体。扫描电子显微镜（SEM）用于观察掺杂金属对凝胶粒子形态的影响。在不同煅烧温度下的XRD图谱揭示了四方相和单斜相的存在，其中La-Mn掺杂的氧化锆在800°C时显示出单斜相。通过77 K下的氮吸附等温线进行的纹理分析揭示了较低的比表面积，但较大的腔体尺寸有利于催化测试中反应物和产物通过多孔结构的传输。La-Fe掺杂的氧化锆，以其主导的四方相，表现出在高浓度三氯乙烯下的最佳催化性能。
