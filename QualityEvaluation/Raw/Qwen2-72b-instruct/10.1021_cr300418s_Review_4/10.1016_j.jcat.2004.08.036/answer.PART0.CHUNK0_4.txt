[1] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[2] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[3] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[4] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."
[5] "In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches that are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase identification, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface composition and oxidation state, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for acid site determination, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for paramagnetic species. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the catalyst's structure, composition, and surface properties. They rule out alternative explanations by demonstrating that the observed changes in catalytic performance are not due to changes in the bulk crystalline structure but rather to modifications in the surface properties, such as the oxidation state of surface species and the number of acid sites.

1.验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法包括用于相识别的X射线衍射(XRD)、用于表面组成和氧化态的X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、用于酸位点确定的傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)和用于顺磁物种的电子顺磁共振(EPR)。这些技术通过提供关于催化剂结构、组成和表面性质的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战。它们通过证明催化性能的观察变化不是由于体相结晶结构的变化，而是由于表面性质的改变，如表面物种的氧化态和酸位点的数量，从而排除了其他解释。
