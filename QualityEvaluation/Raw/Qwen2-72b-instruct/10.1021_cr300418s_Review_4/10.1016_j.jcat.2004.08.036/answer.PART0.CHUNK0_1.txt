[1] "K-doped MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593693 K temperature range."
[2] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[3] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[4] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[5] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."
[6] "In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3. These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of potassium dopants in the MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts. The XRD analysis shows no significant differences in the crystalline phases between undoped and K-doped catalysts, indicating that the dopant does not alter the bulk structure. However, XPS evidence reveals changes in the oxidation state of surface Sb species, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3 indicates differences in the number of acid sites. These changes are related to the enhanced catalytic performance of the K-doped catalysts, particularly in the high selectivity to acrylic acid. The elimination of Brnsted acid sites is a key factor in this improvement. The study also discusses the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity and proposes a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the surface chemistry and acidbase properties of the catalysts.

1.本研究中使用的综合表征方法和分析方法包括XRD、SEM-EDX、EPR、XPS、XANES和NH3吸附的FTIR。这些技术对于验证钾掺杂剂在MoVSb混合氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XRD分析表明，未掺杂和K掺杂催化剂之间的结晶相没有显著差异，表明掺杂剂不会改变体相结构。然而，XPS证据揭示了表面Sb物种氧化态的变化，而NH3吸附的FTIR表明酸位点数量存在差异。这些变化与K掺杂催化剂的增强催化性能有关，特别是在高选择性丙烯酸方面。Brnsted酸位点的消除是这种改进的关键因素。研究还讨论了锑物种在活性和选择性中的作用，并提出了部分氧化反应的反应网络。这些技术通过提供催化剂表面化学和酸碱性质的详细见解，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战。
