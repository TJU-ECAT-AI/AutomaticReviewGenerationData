[1] "K-doped MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593693 K temperature range."
[2] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[3] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[4] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[5] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."
[6] "In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed ammonia (FTIR). These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of potassium dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XRD is used to confirm the crystalline structure, SEM-EDX for morphological analysis and elemental composition, EPR for detecting paramagnetic species, XPS for surface composition and oxidation states, XANES for the oxidation state of antimony, and FTIR for the determination of acid sites. These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the catalyst's structure, composition, and surface properties. The study shows that while the bulk crystalline phases remain unchanged, the surface properties, such as the oxidation state of antimony and the number of acid sites, are significantly altered, which is attributed to the improved selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts.

1.在研究中使用的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、扫描电子显微镜与能量色散X射线光谱(SEM-EDX)、电子顺磁共振(EPR)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)和吸附氨的傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)。这些技术对于验证钾掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XRD用于确认晶体结构，SEM-EDX用于形态分析和元素组成，EPR用于检测顺磁性物种，XPS用于表面组成和氧化态，XANES用于锑的氧化态，FTIR用于酸位点的确定。这些技术集体解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，通过提供催化剂结构、组成和表面性质的详细见解。研究表明，虽然体相晶体相保持不变，但表面性质，如锑的氧化态和酸位点的数量，发生了显著变化，这归因于K掺杂催化剂上丙烯酸选择性的提高。
