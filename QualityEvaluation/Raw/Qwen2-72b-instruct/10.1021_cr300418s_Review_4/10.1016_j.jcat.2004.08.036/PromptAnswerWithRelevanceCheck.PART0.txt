[1] "K-doped MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593693 K temperature range."
[2] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[3] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[4] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[5] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3. These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of potassium dopants in the MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts. The XRD analysis shows no significant differences in the crystalline phases between undoped and K-doped catalysts, indicating that the incorporation of potassium does not alter the bulk structure. However, XPS evidence reveals changes in the oxidation state of surface Sb species, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3 indicates differences in the number of acid sites. These changes in surface properties are related to the enhanced catalytic performance of the K-doped catalysts, particularly in the selectivity to acrylic acid. The techniques used in this study address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the surface chemistry and acid-base properties of the catalysts, which are crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism and improving the selectivity to desired products.

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed ammonia (FTIR). These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of potassium dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XRD is used to confirm the crystalline structure, SEM-EDX for morphological analysis and elemental composition, EPR for detecting paramagnetic species, XPS for surface composition and oxidation states, XANES for the oxidation state of antimony, and FTIR for the determination of acid sites. These techniques collectively address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed insights into the catalyst's structure, composition, and surface properties. The study shows that while the bulk crystalline phases remain unchanged, the surface properties, such as the oxidation state of antimony and the number of acid sites, are significantly altered, which is attributed to the improved selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts.

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These methods include X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX), infrared spectroscopy (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information about the chemical composition, crystal structure, surface properties, and electronic structure of the catalysts. For example, XRD analysis can reveal the presence of crystalline phases, while XPS can provide information about the oxidation state of surface species. FTIR of adsorbed NH3 can determine the number of acid sites, and XANES can provide insights into the oxidation state of specific elements. These techniques can help rule out alternative explanations for the enhanced catalytic performance, such as changes in the bulk structure or the presence of impurities.
