[1] "K-doped MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts have been prepared by impregnation of a MoVSbO mixed oxide (previously prepared by hydrothermal synthesis) with an aqueous solution of potassium nitrate, characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3, and tested in the selective oxidation of propane and propylene in the 593693 K temperature range."
[2] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[3] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[4] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[5] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include XRD, SEM-EDX, EPR, XPS, XANES, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3. These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of potassium dopants in the MoVSb mixed oxides catalysts. The XRD analysis shows no significant differences in the crystalline phases between undoped and K-doped catalysts, indicating that the incorporation of potassium does not alter the bulk structure. However, XPS evidence reveals changes in the oxidation state of surface Sb species, and FTIR of adsorbed NH3 indicates differences in the number of acid sites. These changes in surface properties are related to the enhanced catalytic performance of the K-doped catalysts, particularly in the selectivity to acrylic acid. The techniques used in this study address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the surface chemistry and acid-base properties of the catalysts, which are crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism and improving the selectivity to desired products.

1.本研究中使用的综合表征方法和分析方法包括XRD、SEM-EDX、EPR、XPS、XANES和NH3吸附的FTIR。这些技术对于验证钾掺杂剂在MoVSb混合氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XRD分析显示，未掺杂和K掺杂催化剂之间的结晶相没有显著差异，表明钾的掺入不会改变催化剂的体相结构。然而，XPS证据揭示了表面Sb物种氧化态的变化，而NH3吸附的FTIR表明酸位点数量存在差异。这些表面性质的变化与K掺杂催化剂的增强催化性能有关，特别是在丙烯酸的选择性方面。本研究中使用的技术通过提供催化剂表面化学和酸碱性质的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，这对于理解反应机理和提高对所需产品的选择性至关重要。
