[1] "The undoped MoVSbO catalysts presented a selectivity to acrylic acid lower than 15%, while selectivities to acrylic acid of about 40% can be obtained on K-doped catalysts."
[2] "No appreciable differences between undoped and K-doped catalysts are observed in the nature of crystalline phases present in each case, on the basis of X-ray diffraction analysis."
[3] "However, important differences in both the oxidation state of surface Sb species (according to XPS evidence) and the number of acid sites (determined from FTIR of adsorbed NH3) are observed between the undoped and the K-doped catalysts."
[4] "The high selectivity to acrylic acid on the K-doped catalysts seems to be related to changes in the acidbase properties of the catalysts and most particularly to the elimination of (Brnsted) acid sites."
[5] "In addition, the role of antimony species in activity and selectivity is also discussed and a reaction network for the partial oxidation reaction is proposed."
[6] "The XRD pattern of the undoped MoVSbO catalyst is shown in Fig. 1a. The appearance of peaks at 2θ = 22.3, 25.8, 28.3, 36.3, 45.0, and 50.0can be attributed to the presence of a Sb3+-containing compound like Sb4Mo10O30"
[7] "The morphology of the catalysts has been studied by scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX)."
[8] "The bands at 868, 800, 714, and 652 cm1 can be attributed to antisymmetric vibrations of MoOMe (Me = Mo, Sb) bridging bonds [20,24,30]."
[9] "EPR spectra recorded at 77 K consist in all cases essentially in the overlapping of two signals."
[10] "Binding energies at peak maximum and peak half widths (FWHM) of the V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, and K2p3/2 core-level lines in the XPS spectra of the MVS, MVSK-2,and MVSK-4 samples, as well as the surface metal atomic ratio determined from XPS data, are given in Table 2."
[11] "The Sb3d3/2 peak of the K-containing samples can be fitted with two components at BE = 540.2 and 539.4 eV, assigned to Sb5+ and Sb3+, respectively [26,36,37], while only one component at BE = 539.5 eV, of Sb3+, is observed in the K-free sample."
[12] "Fig. 5 shows the normalized XANES region of the ab- sorption spectra at the Sb LI edge of samples MVS, MVSK- 3, and MVS-A-N and those of FeSbO4 and Sb2O3 used as"

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These methods include X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDX), infrared spectroscopy (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information about the chemical composition, crystal structure, surface properties, and electronic structure of the catalysts. For example, XRD analysis can reveal the presence of crystalline phases, while XPS can provide information about the oxidation state of surface species. FTIR of adsorbed NH3 can determine the number of acid sites, and XANES can provide insights into the oxidation state of specific elements. These techniques can help rule out alternative explanations for the enhanced catalytic performance, such as changes in the bulk structure or the presence of impurities.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。这些方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)分析、带X射线能量色散分析(EDX)的扫描电子显微镜、红外光谱(IR)、电子顺磁共振(EPR)光谱、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)光谱。这些技术通过提供关于催化剂的化学成分、晶体结构、表面性质和电子结构的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间明确关系的挑战。例如，XRD分析可以揭示结晶相的存在，而XPS可以提供关于表面物种氧化态的信息。吸附NH3的FTIR可以确定酸位点的数量，而XANES可以提供对特定元素氧化态的见解。这些技术可以帮助排除增强催化性能的其他解释，例如体结构的变化或杂质的存在。
