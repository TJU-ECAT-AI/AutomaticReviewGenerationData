1.The literature does not provide specific details on the comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention the use of techniques such as X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) and Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to study the effects of dopants on the reducibility and oxygen mobility of ceria, which are crucial for enhanced catalytic performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction. These techniques help in establishing a relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic activity by providing insights into the reduction state of ceria and the behavior of surface intermediates, respectively.

1.文献没有提供验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法的具体细节。但是，它确实提到了使用X射线吸收近边光谱(XANES)和漫反射傅里叶变换红外光谱(DRIFTS)技术来研究掺杂剂对铈氧还原性和氧迁移性的影响，这对于低温水煤气变换反应的催化性能增强至关重要。这些技术通过提供关于铈的还原状态和表面中间体行为的见解，有助于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化活性之间的关系。
