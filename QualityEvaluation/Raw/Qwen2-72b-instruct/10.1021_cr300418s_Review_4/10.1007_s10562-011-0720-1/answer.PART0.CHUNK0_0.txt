1.The literature does not provide specific details on the comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention the use of X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to monitor the reduction of the catalyst in hydrogen and to gain insight into the degree of reduction of the ceria catalyst component. Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was also employed to study the transient decomposition of formates in steam. These techniques help address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing information on the reduction state of the catalyst and the behavior of surface species during catalysis.

1.文献没有提供验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法的具体细节。但是，它确实提到了使用X射线吸收近边光谱(XANES)来监测催化剂在氢气中的还原，并获得对铈催化剂组分还原程度的洞察。还使用了漫反射傅里叶变换红外光谱(DRIFTS)来研究在蒸汽中形式酸的瞬态分解。这些技术通过提供催化剂的还原状态和催化过程中表面物种的行为信息，有助于解决建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。
