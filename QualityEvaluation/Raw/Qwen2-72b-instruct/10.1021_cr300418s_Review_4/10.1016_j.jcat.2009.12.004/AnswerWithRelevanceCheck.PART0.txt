          [1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."

          X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to study the coordination of nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in H2 was performed to study the reduction characteristics of the synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements showed that the quantity and lability of oxygen species reduce with increasing dopant valence. Oxygen desorption properties were studied by O2-TPD measurements. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experiments (TPIE) were also conducted. These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. They address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts, such as crystalline structure, electronic structure, reduction behavior, and oxygen species, while ruling out alternative explanations by correlating these properties with catalytic activity and selectivity.

          使用X射线衍射(XRD)来研究煅烧催化剂中形成的晶相。应用UV-Vis光谱学来研究NiMeO混合金属氧化物中镍物种的配位。在H2中进行温度编程还原(TPR)，以研究合成的镍基混合氧化物催化剂的还原特性。温度编程同位素氧交换测量表明，随着掺杂剂价态的增加，氧物种的数量和活性降低。通过O2-TPD测量研究了氧气脱附性质。还进行了温度编程同位素氧交换实验(TPIE)。这些全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。它们通过提供催化剂的物理和化学性质的详细信息，如晶相结构、电子结构、还原行为和氧物种，来解决建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战，同时通过将这些性质与催化活性和选择性相关联来排除其他解释。
