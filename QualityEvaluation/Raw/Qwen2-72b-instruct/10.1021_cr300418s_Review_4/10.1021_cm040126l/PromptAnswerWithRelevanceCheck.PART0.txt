[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
[3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
[4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal were detected. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed CeO2 crystallites with sizes in the range of 50-60 nm, and the diffraction pattern could be indexed to CeO2 only. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the presence of Rh3+ in the catalysts. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis showed that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information about the chemical state, distribution, and local environment of the dopants.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。使用X射线衍射（XRD）图案检查铑金属或其氧化相的存在，未检测到Rh2O3，RhO2或Rh金属的衍射线。透射电子显微镜（TEM）图像显示CeO2晶体的尺寸在50-60 nm的范围内，衍射图案只能被索引到CeO2。X射线光电子光谱（XPS）证明了催化剂中存在Rh3+。扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析表明，Rh离子在CeO2晶体的表面层中代替了Ce4+离子，周围有氧化物离子空位。这些技术通过提供有关掺杂剂的化学状态，分布和局部环境的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在，结构变化和增强催化性能之间的明确关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。

Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12.

Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k, varying 19 parameters.

XPS showed the presence of Rh3+ in 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 and Rh in the 0 and +3 state upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h. EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2 was found to be the best fit.

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the chemical state, coordination environment, and spatial distribution of the dopants. XRD and Rietveld analysis confirm the absence of dopant phases and reveal the substitution of dopant ions for host ions. XPS shows the oxidation state of the dopants, while EXAFS provides insights into the local structure around the dopant ions. TEM images demonstrate the absence of dopant particles and confirm the homogeneous distribution of dopants at the nanoscale.

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XRD patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal were detected. TEM images showed that the average sizes of CeO2 crystallites were in the range of 50-60 nm, with well-defined edges indicating high crystallinity. XPS showed the presence of Rh3+ in the catalysts, and upon reduction, Rh was present in the 0 and +3 states. EXAFS data were fitted with several structural models, and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2 was found to be the best fit. The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS supports the substitution of Rh3+ ion for Ce4+ ion in CeO2. The lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the proposed redox mechanism.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。使用XRD图案检查了Rh/CeO2催化剂中是否存在铑金属或其氧化相，未检测到Rh2O3，RhO2和Rh金属的衍射线。TEM图像显示CeO2晶粒的平均尺寸在50-60 nm范围内，清晰的边缘表明CeO2的高结晶度。XPS显示催化剂中存在Rh3+，并且在还原后，Rh以0和+3状态存在。EXAFS数据与几种结构模型拟合，发现Rh离子代替CeO2中的Ce4+离子的固溶模型是最佳拟合。XPS中Rh3+的增强表面浓度支持Rh3+离子代替CeO2中的Ce4+离子。足以引起催化转化的较低浓度的Rh支持上述提出的氧化还原机制。
