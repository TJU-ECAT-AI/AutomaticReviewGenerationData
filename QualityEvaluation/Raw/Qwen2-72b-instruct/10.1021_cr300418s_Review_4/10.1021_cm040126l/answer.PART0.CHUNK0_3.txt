[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
[3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
[4] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
[5] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
[6] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XRD patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal were detected. TEM images showed that the average sizes of CeO2 crystallites were in the range of 50-60 nm, with well-defined edges indicating high crystallinity. XPS confirmed the presence of Rh3+ in the catalysts, and EXAFS data were fitted with several structural models, including the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2. The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS supports the substitution of Rh3+ ion in the CeO2 matrix. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XRD图案用于检查铑金属或其氧化相的存在，没有检测到Rh2O3，RhO2或Rh金属的衍射线。TEM图像显示CeO2晶粒的平均尺寸在50-60 nm范围内，清晰的边缘表明CeO2的高结晶度。XPS确认了催化剂中存在Rh3+。EXAFS数据与几种结构模型相匹配，包括Rh离子在CeO2中取代Ce4+离子的固溶体模型。XPS中Rh3+的增强表面浓度支持Rh3+离子在CeO2基质中的替代。这些技术解决了在排除其他解释的同时，建立掺杂剂存在，结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。
