[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[2] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
[3] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2."
[4] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state."
[5] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."

1. XRD patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases in the Rh/CeO2 catalysts. The patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal could be detected. Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k, varying 19 parameters. TEM images showed CeO2 crystallites with an average size of 50-60 nm and high crystallinity. XPS showed the presence of Rh3+ in 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 and Rh in the 0 and +3 state upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h. EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2 was found to be the best fit.

1. 使用XRD图案检查Rh/CeO2催化剂中是否存在铑金属或其氧化相。图案对应于CeO2相，没有检测到Rh2O3，RhO2或Rh金属的衍射线。使用FullProf-fp2k程序对1和2原子% Rh/CeO2 XRD数据进行了Rietveld分析，变化了19个参数。TEM图像显示CeO2晶粒的平均尺寸为50-60 nm，具有高结晶度。XPS显示0.5原子% Rh/CeO2中存在Rh3+，在纯H2中于500 C下还原100 h后，1原子% Rh/CeO2中存在Rh的0和+3状态。Rh/CeO2催化剂的EXAFS数据与几种结构模型进行了拟合，发现Rh离子在CeO2中取代Ce4+离子的固溶模型是最好的拟合。
