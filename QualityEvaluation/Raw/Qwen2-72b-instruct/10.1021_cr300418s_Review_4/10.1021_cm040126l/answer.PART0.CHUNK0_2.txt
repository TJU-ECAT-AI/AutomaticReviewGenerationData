[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[2] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
[3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state."
[4] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor."
[5] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
[6] "The hydrogen uptake measurement demonstrated the unique interaction of Rh and CeO2 in terms of the decrease in reduction temperature from 180 C in pure Rh2O3 to 100  10 C in Rh/CeO2 catalysts."
[7] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[8] "In the case of 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, when the region around 2θ = 41.15 is exploded, a small peak due to Rh(111) can be seen in the pattern, indicating the presence of a trace amount of Rh metal particles."

1. Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the chemical state, coordination environment, and spatial distribution of the dopants. XRD and Rietveld analysis confirm the absence of dopant phases and reveal the substitution of dopant ions for host ions. XPS shows the oxidation state of the dopants, while EXAFS provides insights into the local structure around the dopant ions. TEM images demonstrate the absence of dopant particles and confirm the homogeneous distribution of dopants at the nanoscale.
