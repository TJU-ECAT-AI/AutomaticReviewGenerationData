[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
[2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
[3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
[4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal were detected. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed CeO2 crystallites with sizes in the range of 50-60 nm, and the diffraction pattern could be indexed to CeO2 only. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the presence of Rh3+ in the catalysts. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis showed that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information about the chemical state, distribution, and local environment of the dopants.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。使用X射线衍射（XRD）图案检查铑金属或其氧化相的存在，未检测到Rh2O3，RhO2或Rh金属的衍射线。透射电子显微镜（TEM）图像显示CeO2晶体的尺寸在50-60 nm的范围内，衍射图案只能被索引到CeO2。X射线光电子光谱（XPS）证明了催化剂中存在Rh3+。扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析表明，Rh离子在CeO2晶体的表面层中代替了Ce4+离子，周围有氧化物离子空位。这些技术通过提供有关掺杂剂的化学状态，分布和局部环境的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在，结构变化和增强催化性能之间的明确关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。
