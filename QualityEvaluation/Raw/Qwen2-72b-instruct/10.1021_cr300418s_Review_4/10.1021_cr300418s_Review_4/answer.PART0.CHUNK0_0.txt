[1] "It is difficult to establish beyond doubt that (1) a true homogeneously doped oxide has been synthesized, and (2) it is the homogeneously doped phase that is responsible for the observed catalytic activity."
[2] "Below we discuss methods that have been frequently used in research on catalysis by doped oxides to help answer the questions posed above."
[3] "XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%)."
[4] "XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and NEXAFS (near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure) refer to the same measurements but different energy ranges."
[5] "EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) is used to determine the geometry and the chemical composition of the atoms surrounding the atom that emitted the photoelectron."
[6] "XPS is generally performed in vacuum and is typically ex situ; thus the oxidation states measured may not reflect the electronic environment under reaction conditions."
[7] "XRF is used for establishing the concentration of dopants in the bulk of the catalyst."
[8] "In this technique, light absorption is used to identify the atoms produced by the atomization (e.g., by using a flame) of the doped oxide."
[9] "UVvis can be used to establish the presence of isolated dopant cations within a metal oxide."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron radiation techniques such as XANES and EXAFS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and ultraviolet optical spectroscopy (UVvis). These techniques address the challenges by providing information on the structure, oxidation state, and distribution of dopants, as well as the electronic environment of the catalyst. XRD identifies single crystalline phases, while XANES and EXAFS provide insights into the geometry and chemical composition around the dopant atoms. XPS offers surface composition and oxidation state data, XRF measures dopant concentration in the bulk, AAS identifies atoms produced by atomization, and UVvis confirms the presence of isolated dopant cations. Together, these methods help establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.

1.验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、同步辐射技术如XANES和EXAFS、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线荧光光谱(XRF)、原子吸收光谱(AAS)和紫外可见光谱(UVvis)。这些技术通过提供掺杂剂的结构、氧化态和分布信息，以及催化剂的电子环境信息，来应对挑战。XRD识别单晶相，而XANES和EXAFS提供了掺杂原子周围几何和化学成分的见解。XPS提供了表面组成和氧化态数据，XRF测量了体相中的掺杂浓度，AAS识别了由原子化产生的原子，而UVvis确认了孤立掺杂阳离子的存在。这些方法一起有助于在排除其他解释的同时，建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间的清晰关系。
