          [1] "It is difficult to establish beyond doubt that (1) a true homogeneously doped oxide has been synthesized, and (2) it is the homogeneously doped phase that is responsible for the observed catalytic activity."
          [2] "Below we discuss methods that have been frequently used in research on catalysis by doped oxides to help answer the questions posed above."
          [3] "XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%)."
          [4] "XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and NEXAFS (near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure) refer to the same measurements but different energy ranges."
          [5] "EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) is used to determine the geometry and the chemical composition of the atoms surrounding the atom that emitted the photoelectron."
          [6] "XPS is generally performed in vacuum and is typically ex situ; thus the oxidation states measured may not reflect the electronic environment under reaction conditions."
          [7] "XRF is used for establishing the concentration of dopants in the bulk of the catalyst."
          [8] "In this technique, light absorption is used to identify the atoms produced by the atomization (e.g., by using a flame) of the doped oxide."
          [9] "UVvis can be used to establish the presence of isolated dopant cations within a metal oxide."
          [10] "The synchrotron provides tunable X-ray radiation having 6 orders of magnitude greater intensity than laboratory sources."
          [11] "In studies of ceria doped with Ba, La, Y, Hf, or Zn, used as a catalyst for the watergas shift reaction, Linganiso and co-workers used XANES under TPR reaction conditions to show that the dopants increased the reducibility of ceria with hydrogen."

          Comprehensive characterization methods for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron radiation techniques such as XANES and EXAFS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and ultraviolet optical spectroscopy (UVvis). These techniques address the challenges by providing information on the structure, composition, oxidation state, and electronic environment of the doped oxide. XRD can identify whether a single crystalline phase is present, XPS can determine surface composition and oxidation state, EXAFS can determine the geometry and chemical composition of the atoms surrounding the dopant, XANES and NEXAFS can provide information on the oxidation state and coordination of the dopant, XRF can establish the concentration of dopants in the bulk, AAS can identify atoms produced by atomization, and UVvis can establish the presence of isolated dopant cations. Together, these methods help establish a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations.

          验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、同步辐射技术(如XANES和EXAFS)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线荧光光谱(XRF)、原子吸收光谱(AAS)和紫外可见光谱(UVvis)。这些技术通过提供掺杂氧化物的结构、组成、氧化态和电子环境的信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。XRD可以识别是否存在单晶相，XPS可以确定表面组成和氧化态，EXAFS可以确定掺杂剂周围原子的几何形状和化学组成，XANES和NEXAFS可以提供掺杂剂的氧化态和配位的信息，XRF可以确定掺杂剂在体相中的浓度，AAS可以识别由原子化产生的原子，UVvis可以确定孤立掺杂剂阳离子的存在。这些方法共同有助于在排除其他解释的同时，建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间的明确关系。
