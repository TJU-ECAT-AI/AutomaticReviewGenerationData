[1] "It is difficult to establish beyond doubt that (1) a true homogeneously doped oxide has been synthesized, and (2) it is the homogeneously doped phase that is responsible for the observed catalytic activity."
[2] "Below we discuss methods that have been frequently used in research on catalysis by doped oxides to help answer the questions posed above."
[3] "XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%)."
[4] "The synchrotron provides tunable X-ray radiation having 6 orders of magnitude greater intensity than laboratory sources."
[5] "XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and NEXAFS (near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure) refer to the same measurements but different energy ranges."
[6] "EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) is used to determine the geometry and the chemical composition of the atoms surrounding the atom that emitted the photoelectron."
[7] "XPS is generally performed in vacuum and is typically ex situ; thus the oxidation states measured may not reflect the electronic environment under reaction conditions."
[8] "XRF is used for establishing the concentration of dopants in the bulk of the catalyst."
[9] "In this technique, light absorption is used to identify the atoms produced by the atomization (e.g., by using a flame) of the doped oxide."
[10] "UVvis can be used to establish the presence of isolated dopant cations within a metal oxide."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts include X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron radiation techniques such as XANES and EXAFS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and ultraviolet optical spectroscopy (UVvis). These techniques address the challenges by identifying single crystalline phases, providing high-intensity X-ray radiation for detailed analysis, determining the geometry and chemical composition of atoms, measuring surface composition and oxidation states, establishing dopant concentration in the bulk, and identifying isolated dopant cations. They help in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by confirming homogeneity, identifying dopant effects on electronic and transport properties, and ensuring that catalytic activity is not due to impurities or alternative phases.

1.验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法包括X射线衍射(XRD)、同步辐射技术(如XANES和EXAFS)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、X射线荧光光谱(XRF)、原子吸收光谱(AAS)和紫外可见光谱(UVvis)。这些技术通过识别单晶相、提供高强度X射线辐射进行详细分析、确定原子的几何和化学组成、测量表面组成和氧化态、确定催化剂中掺杂剂的浓度以及识别孤立的掺杂剂阳离子来应对挑战。它们通过确认均匀性、识别掺杂剂对电子和传输性质的影响以及确保催化活性不是由于杂质或替代相来建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间的明确关系。
