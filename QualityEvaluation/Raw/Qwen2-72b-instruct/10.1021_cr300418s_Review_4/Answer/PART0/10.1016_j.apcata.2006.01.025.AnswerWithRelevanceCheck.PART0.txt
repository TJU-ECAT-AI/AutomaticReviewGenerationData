          [1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

          Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XPS was used to analyze the surface composition and chemical states of the elements in the binary oxides before metal promoter loading. EXAFS was employed to explore the possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia, providing evidence of solid mixing through the observation of a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction. TPR and XANES were used to monitor the surface reduction processes, revealing the impact of zirconia addition on the reduction temperature and the formation of active site bridging OH groups. DRIFTS was carried out to examine the intensity of formates present on the catalyst surface and their decomposition rate in the presence of steam. Activity studies were conducted using a fixed bed reactor system to measure the watergas shift rate. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information on the surface chemistry, structural properties, and reaction kinetics of the catalysts.
