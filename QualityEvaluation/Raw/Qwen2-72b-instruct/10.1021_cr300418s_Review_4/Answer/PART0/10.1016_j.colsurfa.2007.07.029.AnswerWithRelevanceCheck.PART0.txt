          [1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
          [3] "The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon."
          [4] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples calcined at temperatures lower than 700 C showed only reflections corresponding to the tetragonal phase."
          [5] "The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples;only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflections corresponding to the monoclinic phase."
          [6] "The FT-IR spectra of (a) fresh xerogels and (b) of calcined samples are presented."
          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          The sol-gel method is used for the preparation of metallic catalysts because it allows for mixing at the atomic scale, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. The crystalline phase obtained by this method depends on the starting metallic precursor. The morphology of the gel particles is influenced by the nature of the doping metal, which can be observed through scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples treated at different temperatures, showing tetragonal and monoclinic phases. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is used to determine the spectra of fresh xerogels and calcined samples. Textural properties of the catalysts are studied through nitrogen sorption isotherms, revealing specific surface areas and pore sizes that can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure during catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia, with its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase, shows the best performance in catalytic tests, resisting high concentrations of trichloroethylene.
