          The literature does not provide specific details on the comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used to verify the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention the use of X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to monitor the reduction of the catalyst in hydrogen and to gain insight into the degree of reduction of the ceria catalyst component. Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was also employed to study the transient decomposition of formates in steam. These techniques help address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing information on the reduction state of the catalyst and the behavior of surface species during catalysis. Additionally, XANES and DRIFTS are used to study the effects of dopants on the reducibility and oxygen mobility of ceria, which are crucial for enhanced catalytic performance in the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction. These techniques help in establishing a relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and catalytic activity by monitoring the reduction of ceria and the decomposition of formates, respectively. They also provide insights into the reduction state of ceria and the behavior of surface intermediates.

          文献没有提供验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法的具体细节。但是，它确实提到了使用X射线吸收近边光谱(XANES)来监测催化剂在氢气中的还原，并获得对铈催化剂组分还原程度的洞察。还使用了漫反射傅里叶变换红外光谱(DRIFTS)来研究在蒸汽中形式酸的瞬态分解。这些技术通过提供催化剂的还原状态和催化过程中表面物种的行为信息，有助于解决建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间清晰关系的挑战。此外，使用X射线吸收近边光谱(XANES)和漫反射傅里叶变换红外光谱(DRIFTS)等技术来研究掺杂剂对铈氧还原性和氧迁移率的影响，这对低温水煤气变换反应的催化性能增强至关重要。这些技术通过监测铈的还原和甲酸盐的分解，有助于建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化活性之间的关系。它们还提供了关于铈的还原状态和表面中间体行为的见解。
