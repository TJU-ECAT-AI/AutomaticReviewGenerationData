XRD patterns were used to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases, and no diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2, or Rh metal were detected. TEM images showed CeO2 crystallites with sizes in the range of 50-60 nm, and the diffraction pattern could be indexed to CeO2 only. XPS demonstrated the presence of Rh3+ in the catalysts. EXAFS analysis showed that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it. Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k, varying 19 parameters. EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2 was found to be the best fit. The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS supports the substitution of Rh3+ ion for Ce4+ ion in CeO2. The lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the proposed redox mechanism.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to study the coordination of nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in H2 was performed to study the reduction characteristics of the synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements showed that the quantity and lability of oxygen species reduce with increasing dopant valence. Oxygen desorption properties were studied by O2-TPD measurements. Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experiments (TPIE) were also conducted. These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. They address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts, such as crystalline structure, electronic structure, reduction behavior, and oxygen species, while ruling out alternative explanations by correlating these properties with catalytic activity and selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on the comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention the use of in situ-EPR, in situ-UVVIS spectroscopy, and on-line GC for studying the behavior of lanthanum-doped CrOx/ZrO2 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These techniques provide complementary information on the structure and valence state of transition metal ions under reaction conditions. The simultaneous coupling of these techniques is a powerful new tool to follow the reaction-dependent interconversion of different Cr oxidation states and the deactivation behavior of CrOx catalysts.

The sol-gel method is used for the preparation of metallic catalysts because it allows for mixing at the atomic scale, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support. The crystalline phase obtained by this method depends on the starting metallic precursor. The morphology of the gel particles is influenced by the nature of the doping metal, which can be observed through scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are used to analyze the crystalline phases of the samples treated at different temperatures, showing tetragonal and monoclinic phases. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is used to determine the spectra of fresh xerogels and calcined samples. Textural properties of the catalysts are studied through nitrogen sorption isotherms, revealing specific surface areas and pore sizes that can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure during catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia, with its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase, shows the best performance in catalytic tests, resisting high concentrations of trichloroethylene.

The literature emphasizes the importance of operando spectroscopy, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous measurement of catalytic activity/selectivity under realistic reaction conditions. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy are particularly suited for studying supported oxides due to their ability to provide information relevant to the catalytic reaction without interference from the support material. The use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information that contributes to a detailed understanding of structure-activity relationships. Operando spectroscopy can assist in establishing fundamental molecular structure-activity/selectivity relationships for catalytic systems. Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies due to negligible interference from the gas phase and the ability to acquire spectra over a wide range of sample temperatures and pressures. The use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information that contributes to the molecular and atomic understanding of structure-activity/selectivity relationships.
