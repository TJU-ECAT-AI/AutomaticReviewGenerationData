          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."

          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."



[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."

          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

          [4] "The best  yield  to  ethylene was  obtained over  the  10% NiZrO catalyst with 60%  ethane conversion and 66%  ethylene selectivity."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."

          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."



[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."

          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

          [2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell  parameter and  the  chemical environ- ment of  the catalysts,indicating the  existence of  strong  interaction between Ni  and  Zr."
          [3] "The interaction plays an  important role  in  the  lessened reducibility and  the distribution of  adsorbed oxygen species,consequently influence their  catalytic performance."
          [4] "The best  yield  to  ethylene was  obtained over  the  10% NiZrO catalyst with 60%  ethane conversion and 66%  ethylene selectivity."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."

          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."



[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."

          [6] "The FT-IR spectra of (a) fresh xerogels and (b) of calcined samples are presented."
          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

          [2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell  parameter and  the  chemical environ- ment of  the catalysts,indicating the  existence of  strong  interaction between Ni  and  Zr."
          [3] "The interaction plays an  important role  in  the  lessened reducibility and  the distribution of  adsorbed oxygen species,consequently influence their  catalytic performance."
          [4] "The best  yield  to  ethylene was  obtained over  the  10% NiZrO catalyst with 60%  ethane conversion and 66%  ethylene selectivity."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."
          [3] "High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2."
          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."

          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

          [2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell  parameter and  the  chemical environ- ment of  the catalysts,indicating the  existence of  strong  interaction between Ni  and  Zr."
          [3] "The interaction plays an  important role  in  the  lessened reducibility and  the distribution of  adsorbed oxygen species,consequently influence their  catalytic performance."
          [4] "The best  yield  to  ethylene was  obtained over  the  10% NiZrO catalyst with 60%  ethane conversion and 66%  ethylene selectivity."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."
          [3] "High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2."
          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."

          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

          [2] "The results show that the doping of Zr affected the cell  parameter and  the  chemical environ- ment of  the catalysts,indicating the  existence of  strong  interaction between Ni  and  Zr."
          [3] "The interaction plays an  important role  in  the  lessened reducibility and  the distribution of  adsorbed oxygen species,consequently influence their  catalytic performance."
          [4] "The best  yield  to  ethylene was  obtained over  the  10% NiZrO catalyst with 60%  ethane conversion and 66%  ethylene selectivity."

[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
          [2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."
          [3] "High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2."
          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."



[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
          [3] "The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon."

          [5] "The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples;only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflections corresponding to the monoclinic phase."
          [6] "The FT-IR spectra of (a) fresh xerogels and (b) of calcined samples are presented."
          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          [3] "The first contribution, around 1.8 Å, corresponds to the NiO first shell bond. In both mixed oxide samples, this first peak is broad and indicates a strongly distorted shell."
          [4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
          [5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."
          [6] "In brief, the Raman results corroborated the XRD and EXAFS data."

          [3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
          [4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing"
          [5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
          [6] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
          [7] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
          [8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
          [9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
          [10] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
          [11] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
          [12] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
          [13] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
          [14] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
          [15] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
          [16] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."
          [17] "The catalysts promoted with Zr were found to be less sensitive to irreversible deactivation by co-fed carbon dioxide."

[1] "The structure and chemical environment of Cu in Cu/CeO2 catalysts synthesized by the solution combustion method have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy."
          [2] "High-resolution XRD studies of 3 and 5 atom % Cu/CeO2 do not show CuO lines in their respective patterns."
          [3] "High-resolution TEM did not show CuO particles in 5 atom % Cu/CeO2."
          [4] "EPR as well as XPS studies confirm the presence of Cu2+ species in the CeO2 matrix."
          [5] "EXAFS investigations of these catalysts show an average coordination number of 3 around the Cu2+ ion in the first shell at a distance of 1.96 Å, indicating the O2- ion vacancy around the Cu2+ ion."
          [6] "The CuO bond length also decreases compared to that in CuO."
          [7] "The second and third shell around the Cu2+ ion in the catalysts are attributed to Cu2+O2-Cu2+ at 2.92 Å and Cu2+O2-Ce4+ at the distance of 3.15 Å, respectively."
          [8] "The present results provide direct evidence for the formation of a Ce1-xCuxO2-δ type of solid solution phase having Cu2+OCe4+ kind of linkages."

[1] "XRD patterns of the Rh/CeO2 catalysts were recorded to check for the presence of rhodium metal or its oxide phases. The XRD patterns corresponded to the CeO2 phase, and diffraction lines due to Rh2O3, RhO2 and Rh metal could not be detected."
          [2] "TEM images of 0.5, 1, and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 and the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 are presented in Figure 5ad. The average sizes of crystallites of CeO2 are in the range of 5060 nm. Well-defined edges of CeO2 crystallites indicate the high crystallinity of CeO2. The diffraction pattern obtained from these crystallites can be indexed to CeO2 only (Figure 5d). There are a few dark patches in the image of <1 nm, indicating high electron density, and it may be due to Rh clusters."
          [3] "XPS of 0.5 atom % Rh/CeO2 was also recorded, and it did show the presence of Rh3+. Upon reduction of 1 atom % Rh/CeO2 in pure H2 at 500 C for 100 h, Rh(3d) spectra shows the presence of Rh in the 0 and +3 state (Figure 7, curve d). The air-heated sample at 500 C shows only the oxidized Rh in the +3 state (curve e). In 2 atom % Rh/CeO2, also Rh is present in the +3 state (curve f)."
          [4] "EXAFS analysis shows that Rh ion is substituted for Ce4+ ion in the surface layers of CeO2 crystallites with oxide ion vacancies around it."
          [5] "Rietveld analysis of 1 and 2 atom % Rh/CeO2 XRD data was done using the program FullProf-fp2k. The total number of parameters varied was 19, such as overall scale factor, background parameters, unit cell, half width, shape, and isotropic thermal parameters along with oxygen occupancy."
          [6] "EXAFS data of Rh/CeO2 catalysts were fitted with several structural models, such as Rh metal, Rh2O3 phases dispersed on CeO2, RhO-like(a  4.13 Å) layer over CeO2 (a  5.411 Å), and the solid solution model with Rh ion substituting for Ce4+ ion in CeO2, i.e., Ce1-xRhxO2-δ. Fitting with the first three models was very poor. The k3-weighted FT and inverse transform spectra of 1% Rh/CeO2 and 2% Rh/CeO2 catalysts fitted with solid solution model are presented in Figure 12. The fit is reasonably good."
          [7] "The enhanced surface concentration of Rh3+ in XPS indeed supports this point. In pure CeO2, the Ce4+OCe4+ correlation at 3.82 Å is due to CeOCe angle of 109.5. Due to substitution of the smaller Rh3+ ion, geometry around the Rh3+ ion will be different from Ce4+ in CeO2."
          [8] "In the case of Cu/CeO2, Pd/CeO2, and Pt/CeO2, metal ion seems to go from +2 to 0 and correspondingly only two Ce ions gets reduced.10-12 Therefore, the lower concentration of Rh sufficient to bring about catalytic conversion supports the above mechanism."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for investigating the crystalline phases formed in the calcined catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for all the samples plus that of NiO and NiNbO used as reference. In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53."
          [2] "UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands."
          [3] "Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts. The TPR profiles, shown in Fig. 4, were acquired by continuously following the H2 signal with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while linearly increasing temper- ature."
          [4] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange measurements portray furthermore that not only the quantity but also the lability of the oxygen species reduces with increasing dopant valence. These electrophilic oxygen species catalyze the total oxidation reactions of ethane to COx, and thus their reduction/elimination favors the selective oxidation to ethylene."
          [5] "The oxygen desorption properties of selected catalysts were studied by O2-TPD measurements. The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment."
          [6] "Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min. The system was maintained isothermally at 650 C for 30 min under the reactant mixture. The reactor exit was connected by a heated inlet capillary system to a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzer) for the online monitoring of the 68 exit gas composition."



[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
          [3] "The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon."
          [4] "The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples calcined at temperatures lower than 700 C showed only reflections corresponding to the tetragonal phase."
          [5] "The XRD patterns of the synthesized catalysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples;only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflections corresponding to the monoclinic phase."
          [6] "The FT-IR spectra of (a) fresh xerogels and (b) of calcined samples are presented."
          [7] "The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000 PC spectrometer."
          [8] "The textural properties of the catalysts were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K."
          [9] "The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from 1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately (Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability characteristics of the porous materials."
          [10] "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples treated at 500 and 600 C."
          [11] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [12] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."
