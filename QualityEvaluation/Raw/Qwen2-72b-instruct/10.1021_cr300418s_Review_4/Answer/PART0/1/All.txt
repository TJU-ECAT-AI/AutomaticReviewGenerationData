The availability of information about the surface composition can help in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance. HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS and SIMS in terms of information depth and quantification. It can determine the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface, providing sensitive analysis for the outermost atomic layer where catalytic processes take place. HS-LEIS can also provide information about layers immediately beneath the surface, which is relevant for the dispersion of the active catalytic component on the surface of the catalyst. The technique is sensitive and exhibits detection limits on the order of several ppm for high values of m2/m1, while mass resolution is good for low values of m2/m1. HS-LEIS spectra can be recorded with different primary ions to improve mass resolution and sensitivity for lighter or heavier surface atoms. The technique is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional LEIS and can perform Static LEIS, obtaining good spectra while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface. Quantification is straightforward, as HS-LEIS peaks are proportional to the amount of scattering surface atoms for a given primary ion, primary ion energy, and scattering surface atom. Backgrounds are subtracted from the peaks, the peaks are integrated, and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms. When a pure reference of the element is analyzed, peak areas from the unknown samples can be expressed as fractions of the peak area for the pure element, yielding surface fractions for the unknown samples. Calibration plots can also be used for quantification, where the area of one peak is plotted as a function of the area of another peak for a number of samples.

However, it does mention High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) as a technique that provides quantitative compositional information about the outermost atomic layer of a material, crucial for the fundamental study of catalysis and the optimization of industrial catalysts. HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS (ESCA) and SIMS due to its specificity for the outermost atomic layer and straightforward quantification. The technique determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface, enabling the identification of elements with masses in the range from 12 to 60 amu using 4He+ ions. For heavier surface atoms, the mass resolution can be improved by using 20Ne+ ions. HS-LEIS is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional LEIS, allowing for Static LEIS where good spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface.
