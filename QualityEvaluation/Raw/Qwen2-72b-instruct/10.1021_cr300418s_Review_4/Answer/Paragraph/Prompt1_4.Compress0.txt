However, it does mention High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) as a technique that provides quantitative compositional information about the outermost atomic layer of a material, crucial for the fundamental study of catalysis and the optimization of industrial catalysts. HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS (ESCA) and SIMS due to its specificity for the outermost atomic layer and straightforward quantification. The technique determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface, enabling the identification of elements with masses in the range from 12 to 60 amu using 4He+ ions. For heavier surface atoms, the mass resolution can be improved by using 20Ne+ ions. HS-LEIS is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional LEIS, allowing for Static LEIS where good spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface. Quantification is straightforward as long as experimental conditions are chosen with care, and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms.

When a pure reference of the element is analyzed, peak areas from the unknown samples can be expressed as fractions of the peak area for the pure element, yielding surface fractions for the unknown samples. Calibration plots can also be used for quantification, where the area of one peak is plotted as a function of the area of another peak for a number of samples.

However, it does mention High Sensitivity-Low Energy Ion Scattering (HS-LEIS) as a technique that provides quantitative compositional information about the outermost atomic layer of a material, crucial for the fundamental study of catalysis and the optimization of industrial catalysts. HS-LEIS compares favorably to XPS (ESCA) and SIMS due to its specificity for the outermost atomic layer and straightforward quantification. The technique determines the mass of surface atoms by measuring the energy from ions that are scattered from the surface, enabling the identification of elements with masses in the range from 12 to 60 amu using 4He+ ions. For heavier surface atoms, the mass resolution can be improved by using 20Ne+ ions. HS-LEIS is orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional LEIS, allowing for Static LEIS where good spectra are obtained while less than 0.5% of a monolayer is sputtered from the sample surface. Quantification is straightforward as long as experimental conditions are chosen with care, and peak areas are proportional to the surface fraction of the atoms.

In most NiMeO mixed oxides, XRD analysis exhibits only diffraction lines corresponding to a crystal- line NiO-like phase. In the NiNbO sample, the appearance of an additional broad band centered at 2h 27 is apparent. This dif- fraction has been attributed to an amorphous niobium-rich phase [14,22]. In NiTiO, minor amounts of free TiO2 anatase are also formed, evidenced by the diffractions at 2h 27, 48 and 54, while for NiTaO, very poor crystallization is generally observed with diffraction lines corresponding to NiO and NiTa2O6 at 2h 26.7,35 and 53.\"\n          [2] \"UVvis spectroscopy was applied in order to study the coordi- nation of the nickel species in the NiMeO mixed metal oxides. The UVvis spectra are presented in Fig. 3. It should be mentioned that high absorbance was recorded over the whole measured wavelength range because of the dark (gray) color of the samples,indicating the presence of nickel in a non-stoichiometric form and resulting in weak absorbance bands.\"\n          [3] \"Temperature-programmed reduction in H2 was performed in order to study the reduction characteristics of the as synthesized nickel-based mixed oxide catalysts.

The catalyst sample (200 mg) was pretreated in a flow of pure oxygen at 450 C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature under the oxygen flow. The system was subsequently flushed with helium for 1 h, and the tempera- ture was raised to 850 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min in He (50 cm3/min). The reactor exit was monitored online by a quadru- pole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers), and the desorbed oxygen was detected by following the 32 (m/z) fragment.\"\n          [6] \"Temperature-programmed isotopic oxygen exchange experi- ments (TPIE) were also performed in the earlier mentioned appara- tus. Before each experiment, the catalyst (25 mg) was pretreated in 10% 16O2/He flow at 450 C for 1 h, followed by flushing in He for 1 h and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The catalyst sample (250 mg) was subjected to 2% 18O2 (Cambridge Isotope Lab- oratories; 95% atom enrichment)/He flow (40 cm3/min), and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 650 C at a heating rate of 15 C/min.
