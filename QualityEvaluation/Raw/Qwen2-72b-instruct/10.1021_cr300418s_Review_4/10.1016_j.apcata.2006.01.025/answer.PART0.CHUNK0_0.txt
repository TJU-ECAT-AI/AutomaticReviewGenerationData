1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter. A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C). The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively. For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing. It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlate well with the EXAFS data. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information about the surface composition, binding energy, and solid solution formation. For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed. Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C, increasing slightly in temperature with increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C. Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide, resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups. The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts, promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts. The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts. Considering the surface formate mechanism, there are two possibilities that appear feasible that could account for enhanced formate decomposition rates. A second possibility is that the hydrogen abstraction rate may be higher for the zirconia promoted materials. A third possibility considers a different mechanism, the ceria-mediated redox model. The sensitivity of metal promoted partially reducible oxides to carbon dioxide is an issue that remains unresolved. Because there are, reportedly, less carbonates for materials doped with Zr, it is anticipated that Pt promoted CeZr binary oxides may be more resistant to the negative effect of carbon dioxide.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XPS结果，归一化以消除碳信号，如图1AC和表2所示。结果是二元氧化物在加载金属促进剂之前的。随着Zr浓度的增加，O 1s（529 eV）光谱（图1C）的结合能略有增加。通过扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）进一步探索了氧化铈和氧化锆之间形成固溶体的可能性。Zr K边的EXAFS傅立叶变换幅度光谱如图2所示，分别为ZrO2、Ce0.50Zr0.50O2和Ce0.75Zr0.25O2。然而，对于两个CeZr催化剂，存在一个额外的峰值，出现在3.63.75 A。这个峰值以前被分配给ZrCe相互作用，表明固体混合。有趣的是，从XPS（表2）报告的表面浓度与EXAFS数据很好地相关。这些技术通过提供关于表面组成、结合能和固溶体形成方面的详细信息，解决了在建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间的明确关系时的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。对于基于氧化铈的水煤气变换催化剂，表面壳层的还原温度很重要，因为这个温度对应于活性位点桥接OH基团形成时的温度。有趣的是，直接对WGS反应重要的表面壳层还原过程实际上分为两个特征，一个低温特征在300400 8C范围内，随着Zr水平的增加，温度略有增加，另一个高温峰位于接近500 8C的位置。添加金属促进剂通过Pt的还原和氢从金属促进剂向氧化物表面的溢出，促进了表面壳层的还原步骤，导致直接形成桥接OH基团。Zr掺杂的铈催化剂的WGS速率，用Pt促进，比未掺杂的Pt/ceria或Pt/zirconia催化剂更高。WGS速率在1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2催化剂中达到最大值。考虑到表面甲酸盐机制，有两种可能性似乎可行，可以解释甲酸盐分解速率的增强。第二种可能性是，对于氧化锆促进的材料，氢的提取率可能更高。第三种可能性考虑了一种不同的机制，即氧化铈介导的氧化还原模型。金属促进的可部分还原氧化物对二氧化碳的敏感性是一个尚未解决的问题。据报道，对于掺杂Zr的材料，碳酸盐较少，因此预计Pt促进的CeZr二元氧化物可能对二氧化碳的负面影响更具抵抗力。
