1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XPS结果，归一化以消除碳信号，如图1AC和表2所示。结果是二元氧化物在加载金属促进剂之前的。随着Zr浓度的增加，O 1s（529 eV）光谱（图1C）的结合能略有增加。通过扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）进一步探索了氧化铈和氧化锆之间形成固溶体的可能性。Zr K边的EXAFS傅立叶变换幅度光谱如图2所示，分别为ZrO2、Ce0.50Zr0.50O2和Ce0.75Zr0.25O2。然而，对于两个CeZr催化剂，存在一个额外的峰值，出现在3.63.75 A。这个峰值以前被分配给ZrCe相互作用，表明固体混合。有趣的是，从XPS（表2）报告的表面浓度与EXAFS数据很好地相关。这些技术通过提供关于表面组成、结合能和固溶体形成方面的详细信息，解决了在建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和催化性能增强之间的明确关系时的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。对于基于氧化铈的水煤气变换催化剂，表面壳层的还原温度很重要，因为这个温度对应于活性位点桥接OH基团形成时的温度。有趣的是，直接对WGS反应重要的表面壳层还原过程实际上分为两个特征，一个低温特征在300400 8C范围内，随着Zr水平的增加，温度略有增加，另一个高温峰位于接近500 8C的位置。添加金属促进剂通过Pt的还原和氢从金属促进剂向氧化物表面的溢出，促进了表面壳层的还原步骤，导致直接形成桥接OH基团。Zr掺杂的铈催化剂的WGS速率，用Pt促进，比未掺杂的Pt/ceria或Pt/zirconia催化剂更高。WGS速率在1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2催化剂中达到最大值。考虑到表面甲酸盐机制，有两种可能性似乎可行，可以解释甲酸盐分解速率的增强。第二种可能性是，对于氧化锆促进的材料，氢的提取率可能更高。第三种可能性考虑了一种不同的机制，即氧化铈介导的氧化还原模型。金属促进的可部分还原氧化物对二氧化碳的敏感性是一个尚未解决的问题。据报道，对于掺杂Zr的材料，碳酸盐较少，因此预计Pt促进的CeZr二元氧化物可能对二氧化碳的负面影响更具抵抗力。

[6] "Adsorption of CO also provides some indication of the Pt dispersion. As shown in Fig. 5A, the broad PtCO band (1900 2100 cm1) is similar in intensity among the catalyst samples,indicating comparable Pt dispersions."
[7] "Regarding formate stability, there are several important findings of note to date. Formates are quite stable at low temperature, and they slowly decompose thermally (i.e. in the absence of H2O) primarily back to CO and OH [10] (i.e. reverse formate decomposition)."
[8] "Interestingly, changing from Au to Pt, or increasing the loading of either metal, was found to enhance the formate decomposition rate further [16,17]. Therefore, the metal may play a role in increasing the hydrogen abstraction rate."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XPS was used to determine the surface composition of Ce relative to Zr, EXAFS was employed to examine whether or not a binary oxide solid solution was formed, TPR was used to monitor the surface reduction processes, and DRIFTS was carried out to examine the impact of zirconia addition on the intensity of formates present on the catalyst surface, as well as their decomposition rate in the presence of steam. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information about the surface chemistry, electronic structure, and reactivity of the catalysts.
