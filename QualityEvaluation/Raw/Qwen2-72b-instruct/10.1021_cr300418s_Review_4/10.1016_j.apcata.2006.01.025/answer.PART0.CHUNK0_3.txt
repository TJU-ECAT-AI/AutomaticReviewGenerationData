1.A variety of comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. These include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and steady state catalytic activity and carbon dioxide sensitivity measurements using a fixed bed reactor system. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the surface composition, solid solution formation, surface reduction processes, formate stability, and activity under realistic conditions. They also help rule out alternative explanations by confirming the presence of dopants, their distribution, and their impact on the catalytic activity.

1.为了验证掺杂剂在金属氧化物催化剂中的成功掺入和均匀分布，需要采用各种全面的表征方法和分析方法。这些方法包括X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构光谱（EXAFS）、温度程序还原（TPR）、X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）、漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）以及使用固定床反应器系统进行的稳态催化活性和二氧化碳敏感性测量。这些技术通过提供表面组成、固溶体形成、表面还原过程、甲酸盐稳定性以及在实际条件下的活性的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化与增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战。它们还通过确认掺杂剂的存在、分布及其对催化活性的影响，帮助排除了其他解释。
