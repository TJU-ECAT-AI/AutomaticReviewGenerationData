[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
[2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
[3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
[4] "For the two CeZr catalysts, however, there is an additional peak, which arises at 3.63.75 A . This peak has been assigned previously to the ZrCe interaction, indicative of solid mixing."
[5] "It is interesting to point out that the surface concentrations reported from XPS (Table 2) correlatewell with the EXAFS data."
[6] "The Zr/Ce ratio for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 material was close to the expected result if a solid solution had formed, as suggested by EXAFS."
[7] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
[8] "Addition of a metal promoter facilitates the surface shell reduction step, likely by reduction of Pt and spillover of hydrogen from the metal promoter to the surface of the oxide,resulting in direct formation of bridging OH groups."
[9] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
[10] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts."
[11] "The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
[12] "The formate decomposition rate was, however, accelerated by zirconia addition, and was found to be higher than either Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia alone."
[13] "The overall rate of the formate decomposition (number of active sites multiplied by the turnover rate of the formate decom- position) was found to pass through a maximum."
[14] "A reasonable correlation was found between the formate decomposition rates and the watergas shift activity, which also passed through a maximum."
[15] "Two types of formates were observed, those associated with a surface Ce ion and those associated with a Zr surface ion."
[16] "The relative amounts of the two formates correlated very well to the relative Zr/Ce atomic ratios obtained by XPS."
[17] "EXAFS results provided direct evidence that a solid solution was present in the mixed oxide, as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction was observed,increasing with increasing Ce/Zr ratio."

1.Comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XPS was used to analyze the surface composition of the binary oxides, showing the Zr and Ce concentrations and their changes with doping levels. EXAFS was employed to explore the possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia, providing evidence of solid mixing through the observation of a distinct peak in the Fourier transform magnitude corresponding to the ZrCe interaction. TPR and XANES were used to monitor the surface reduction processes, revealing the impact of zirconia addition on the reduction temperature and the formation of active site bridging OH groups. The formate decomposition rate and watergas shift activity were also measured, showing a correlation with the dopant presence and structural changes. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the surface composition, solid solution formation, reduction processes, and catalytic activity, while ruling out alternative explanations by correlating the results from different characterization methods.

1.全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XPS用于分析二元氧化物的表面组成，显示Zr和Ce的浓度及其随掺杂水平的变化。EXAFS被用来探索氧化铈和氧化锆之间形成固溶体的可能性，通过观察傅立叶变换幅度中对应于ZrCe相互作用的明显峰，提供了固体混合的证据。TPR和XANES被用来监测表面还原过程，揭示了氧化锆添加对还原温度和活性位点桥接OH基团形成的影响。还测量了甲酸盐分解速率和水煤气转换活性，显示了与掺杂剂存在和结构变化的关联。这些技术通过提供表面组成、固溶体形成、还原过程和催化活性的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，同时通过从不同表征方法的相关结果排除了其他解释。
