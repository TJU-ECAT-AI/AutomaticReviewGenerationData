[1] "XPS results, normalized to subtract out the signal from carbon, are depicted in Fig. 1AC and Table 2. The results are for the binary oxides prior to loading of metal promoter."
[2] "A slight increase in the binding energy with Zr concentration was noted for the O 1s (529 eV) spectra (Fig. 1C)."
[3] "The possibility of a solid solution between ceria and zirconia was further explored with EXAFS. EXAFS Fourier transform magnitude spectra for the Zr K-edge are presented in Fig. 2 for ZrO2, Ce0.50Zr0.50O2, and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, respectively."
[4] "For ceria-based watergas shift catalysts, the temperature of reduction for the surface shell is important, as this temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the active site bridging OH groups are formed [16]."
[5] "Interestingly, the surface shell reduction process, directly important for the WGS reaction, is actually split into two features, a low temperature feature in the range of 300400 8C,increasing slightly in temperaturewith increasing Zr levels, and a higher temperature peak situated at close to 500 8C."
[6] "Adsorption of CO also provides some indication of the Pt dispersion. As shown in Fig. 5A, the broad PtCO band (1900 2100 cm1) is similar in intensity among the catalyst samples,indicating comparable Pt dispersions."
[7] "Regarding formate stability, there are several important findings of note to date. Formates are quite stable at low temperature, and they slowly decompose thermally (i.e. in the absence of H2O) primarily back to CO and OH [10] (i.e. reverse formate decomposition)."
[8] "Interestingly, changing from Au to Pt, or increasing the loading of either metal, was found to enhance the formate decomposition rate further [16,17]. Therefore, the metal may play a role in increasing the hydrogen abstraction rate."
[9] "The WGS rates were higher for the Zr doped cerium catalysts,promoted with Pt, than either the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia undoped catalysts. The WGS rate reaches a maximum for the 1% Pt/ Ce0.50Zr0.50O2 catalysts."
[10] "We consider three possible explanations for the enhanced rates observed on the Pt/ceriazirconia catalysts relative to the Pt/ceria or Pt/zirconia catalysts."
[11] "A second possibility is that the hydrogen abstraction rate may be higher for the zirconia promoted materials."
[12] "A third possibility considers a different mechanism, the ceria-mediated redox model [21,37,38]."
[13] "The sensitivity of metal promoted partially reducible oxides to carbon dioxide is an issue that remains unresolved [38,45,46]."
[14] "Because there are, reportedly, less carbonates for materials doped with Zr (see Fig. 8), it is anticipated that Pt promoted CeZr binary oxides may be more resistant to the negative effect of carbon dioxide."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. XPS was used to determine the surface composition of Ce relative to Zr, EXAFS was employed to examine whether or not a binary oxide solid solution was formed, TPR was used to monitor the surface reduction processes, and DRIFTS was carried out to examine the impact of zirconia addition on the intensity of formates present on the catalyst surface, as well as their decomposition rate in the presence of steam. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance while ruling out alternative explanations by providing detailed information about the surface chemistry, electronic structure, and reactivity of the catalysts.

1.本研究中使用的全面表征方法和分析方法包括X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、扩展X射线吸收精细结构光谱(EXAFS)、温度程序还原(TPR)和漫反射红外傅里叶变换光谱(DRIFTS)。这些技术对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。XPS用于确定Ce相对于Zr的表面组成，EXAFS用于检查是否形成了二元氧化物固溶体，TPR用于监测表面还原过程，DRIFTS用于检查氧化锆添加对催化剂表面存在的甲酸盐强度以及在蒸汽存在下的分解速率的影响。这些技术通过提供关于催化剂的表面化学、电子结构和反应性的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间清晰关系的挑战，同时排除了其他解释。
