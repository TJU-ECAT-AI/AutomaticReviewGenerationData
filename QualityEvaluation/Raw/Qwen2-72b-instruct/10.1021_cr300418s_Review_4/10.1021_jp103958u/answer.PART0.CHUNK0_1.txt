[1] "The structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y nanosystems prepared by a reverse microemulsion method were characterized with synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations."
[2] "An analysis of the Ni K edge XANES region displayed in Figure 2 shows that Ni is in a +2 oxidation state."
[3] "The first contribution, around 1.8 Å, corresponds to the NiO first shell bond. In both mixed oxide samples, this first peak is broad and indicates a strongly distorted shell."
[4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
[5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."
[6] "In brief, the Raman results corroborated the XRD and EXAFS data."
[7] "The chemical reactivity of the Ce1xNixO2y mixed oxides was tested using reaction with H2 as a probe."
[8] "The reactivity of the samples toward CO was also followed by in situ TR-XRD and XANES experiments."
[9] "Finally, the Ce1x NixO2y systems were tested as catalysts for the WGS reaction."
[10] "In situ characterization of the catalysts during the reaction was performed by XRD, XANES, and DRIFT."

1.The comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches used in the study include synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. These techniques are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy can provide information on the structural changes and electronic properties of the catalysts, while Raman spectroscopy can reveal the vibrational properties and structural changes. Density functional calculations can help understand the electronic structure and charge redistribution in the catalysts. These techniques address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. They can also help rule out alternative explanations for the observed catalytic activity by providing evidence for the presence and distribution of dopants and their effects on the catalyst structure and properties.
