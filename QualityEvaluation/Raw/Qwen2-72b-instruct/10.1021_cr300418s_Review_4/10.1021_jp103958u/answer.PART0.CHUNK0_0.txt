[1] "The structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y nanosystems prepared by a reverse microemulsion method were characterized with synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations."
[2] "An analysis of the Ni K edge XANES region displayed in Figure 2 shows that Ni is in a +2 oxidation state."
[3] "The first contribution, around 1.8 Å, corresponds to the NiO first shell bond. In both mixed oxide samples, this first peak is broad and indicates a strongly distorted shell."
[4] "The Bader charge seems to decrease for Ce with respect to CeO2 in a modest way, which may indicate charge redistribution mostly by an effect of changes in the OCe distances or by differences when going from Ce  O  Ce to Ce  O  Ni electronic interactions."
[5] "The fresh Ce1xNixO2y samples have also been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak located near 460 cm1."

1.The structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y nanosystems were characterized using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. The Ni K edge XANES analysis showed that Ni is in a +2 oxidation state. The EXAFS analysis indicated a strongly distorted NiO first shell bond. The Bader charge analysis suggested a modest decrease for Ce, indicating charge redistribution. Raman spectroscopy revealed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak.

1.Ce1xNixO2y纳米系统的结构和电子性质使用同步辐射X射线衍射、X射线吸收光谱、拉曼光谱和密度泛函计算进行了表征。Ni K边XANES分析显示Ni处于+2氧化态。EXAFS分析表明NiO第一壳层键严重扭曲。Bader电荷分析表明Ce的电荷略有下降，表明电荷重新分布。拉曼光谱显示第一阶F2g铈峰的强烈频率偏移和展宽。
