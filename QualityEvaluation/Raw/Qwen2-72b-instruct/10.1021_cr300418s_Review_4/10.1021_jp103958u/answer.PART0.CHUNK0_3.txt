1.The structural and electronic properties of Ce1xNixO2y nanosystems were characterized using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional calculations. The Ni K edge XANES analysis showed that Ni is in a +2 oxidation state. The EXAFS analysis indicated a strongly distorted NiO first shell bond. The Bader charge analysis suggested a modest decrease for Ce, indicating charge redistribution. Raman spectroscopy revealed a strong frequency shift and broadening for the first-order F2g ceria peak. The Raman results corroborated the XRD and EXAFS data. The chemical reactivity of the Ce1xNixO2y mixed oxides was tested using reaction with H2. In situ time-resolved XRD and XANES data were collected during the WGS reaction. In situ DRIFT data were also obtained for the WGS on pure ceria and Ce1xNixO2y mixed-metal oxides. These comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches are crucial for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. They address the challenges in establishing a clear relationship between dopant presence, structural changes, and enhanced catalytic performance by providing detailed information on the electronic and structural properties of the materials, ruling out alternative explanations.

1.使用同步辐射X射线衍射、X射线吸收光谱、拉曼光谱和密度泛函计算对Ce1xNixO2y纳米系统进行了表征。Ni K边XANES分析表明Ni处于+2氧化态。EXAFS分析表明NiO第一壳层键强烈扭曲。Bader电荷分析表明Ce的电荷略有下降，表明电荷重新分布。拉曼光谱显示第一阶F2g铈峰的频率偏移和展宽强烈。拉曼结果证实了XRD和EXAFS数据。使用H2反应测试了Ce1xNixO2y混合氧化物的化学反应性。在WGS反应中收集了原位时间分辨XRD和XANES数据。还获得了纯铈和Ce1xNixO2y混合金属氧化物WGS的原位DRIFT数据。这些全面的表征方法和分析方法对于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂的成功掺入和均匀分布至关重要。它们通过提供有关材料的电子和结构特性的详细信息，解决了建立掺杂剂存在、结构变化和增强催化性能之间明确关系的挑战，排除了其他解释。
