1.The literature does not provide specific information on comprehensive characterization methods and analytical approaches for verifying the successful incorporation and homogeneous distribution of dopants in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does emphasize the importance of operando spectroscopy, which combines in situ spectroscopy with simultaneous measurement of catalytic activity/selectivity under realistic reaction conditions. This methodology can help establish structure-activity relationships and understand the dynamic states of catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermediates during catalytic reactions. Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy are particularly suited for studying supported oxides due to their ability to provide information relevant to the catalytic reaction without interference from the support material. The use of several spectroscopic techniques can provide complementary information that contributes to a detailed understanding of structure-activity relationships.

1.文献没有提供关于验证金属氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂成功掺入和均匀分布的全面表征方法和分析方法的具体信息。然而，它确实强调了原位光谱学的重要性，原位光谱学与在现实反应条件下同时测量催化活性/选择性相结合。这种操作方法有助于建立结构-活性关系，并理解催化反应期间催化活性位点和表面反应中间体的动态状态。拉曼光谱等技术特别适合研究氧化物支撑，因为它们能够提供与催化反应相关的信息，而不会受到支撑材料的干扰。几种光谱技术的联合使用可以提供互补信息，对结构-活性关系的详细理解做出重大贡献。
