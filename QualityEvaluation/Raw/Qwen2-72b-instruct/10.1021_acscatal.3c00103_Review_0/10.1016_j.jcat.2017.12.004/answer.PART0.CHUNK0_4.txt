1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to improve the catalytic performance and long-term stability for PDH reactions. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供生产丙烯的替代途径来应对这些挑战。PDH工艺，无论是氧化还是非氧化，都在开发中以克服催化剂失活问题，提高稳定性和可回收性。创新的催化剂设计策略，如使用基于V的催化剂支持在介孔二氧化硅固体上，正在被探索以提高PDH反应的催化性能和长期稳定性。VOX-SiO2催化剂在不同凝胶化和煅烧温度下合成的研究表明，优化的催化剂在PDH的八个反应-再生循环中表现出显著的长期催化稳定性，丙烷转化率在4小时反应时间内缓慢下降，从55%下降到45%，而丙烯选择性保持在约91%。
