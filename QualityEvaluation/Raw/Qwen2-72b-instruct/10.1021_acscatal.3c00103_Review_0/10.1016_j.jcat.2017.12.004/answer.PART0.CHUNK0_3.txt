1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to improve the catalytic performance and long-term stability for PDH reactions. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes.
