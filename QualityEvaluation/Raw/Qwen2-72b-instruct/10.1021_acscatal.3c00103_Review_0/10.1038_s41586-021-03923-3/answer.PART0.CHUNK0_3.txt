1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for the production of this industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have issues with the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An environmentally compatible supported catalyst based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）制丙烯是替代石油基裂解过程的重要途径，用于生产这种工业上重要的平台化学品。使用含Cr或含Pt催化剂的商业PDH技术存在Cr(VI)化合物的毒性问题，或需要使用对生态有害的氯进行催化剂再生。已经引入了一种基于商业ZnO的环境兼容的支撑催化剂。支撑的ZnOx物种通过还原处理过程中ZnO生成的Zn原子与支撑OH基团的反应原位形成。已经确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的决定性作用。
