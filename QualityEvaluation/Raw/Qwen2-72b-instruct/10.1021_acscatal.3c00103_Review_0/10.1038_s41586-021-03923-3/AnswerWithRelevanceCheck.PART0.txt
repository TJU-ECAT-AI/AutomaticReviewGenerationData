          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
          [2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
          [3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."
          [4] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."
          [5] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."
          [6] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."
          [7] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）生成丙烯是替代石油基裂解过程的重要途径，用于生产工业上重要的平台化学品丙烯。使用含Cr或含Pt催化剂的商业PDH技术由于Cr(VI)化合物的毒性或需要使用对环境有害的氯进行催化剂再生而受到限制。我们介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容的负载型催化剂的方法。通过在550C以上还原处理时ZnO生成的Zn原子与支撑OH基团的反应，原位形成负载的ZnOx物种。通过不同的互补表征方法，我们确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的决定性作用。为了进行基准测试，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1和商业KCrOx/Al2O3的类似物在相同设置下，在工业相关条件下，在约400小时内对丙烷流进行了测试。开发的催化剂在相似的丙烯选择性下，显示出约三倍的丙烯生产力。
