1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. A new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, showing that the new catalyst has about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）生成丙烯是替代石油基裂解过程的重要途径，用于生产这种工业上重要的平台化学品。使用含Cr或含Pt的商业PDH技术由于Cr(VI)化合物的毒性或需要使用对生态有害的氯进行催化剂再生而受到限制。我们介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容的支撑催化剂的方法。支撑的ZnOx物种通过支持OH基团与ZnO在550C以上还原处理生成的Zn原子的反应原位形成。我们通过不同的互补表征方法确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的决定性作用。为了进行基准测试，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1和商业KCrOx/Al2O3的类似物在相同的设置下，在工业相关条件下，在约400小时内对丙烷流进行了测试。开发的催化剂显示出约三倍的丙烯生产力，丙烯选择性相似。
