[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."
[4] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."
[5] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."
[6] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."
[7] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. A new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, showing that the new catalyst has about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）生成丙烯是替代石油基裂解过程的重要方法，用于生产工业上重要的平台化学品。商业PDH技术使用含Cr或含Pt的催化剂，但由于Cr(VI)化合物的毒性或需要使用对环境有害的氯进行催化剂再生，存在局限性。我们介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容的支撑催化剂的新方法。支撑的ZnOx物种通过还原处理过程中ZnO生成的Zn原子与支撑OH基团的反应原位形成。我们通过不同的互补表征方法确定了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的决定性作用。为了进行基准测试，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂和商业KCrOx/Al2O3的类似物在工业相关条件下进行了测试，结果表明，新开发的催化剂在相似的丙烯选择性下，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍。
