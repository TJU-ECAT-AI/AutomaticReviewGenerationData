1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过将来自页岩气沉积物的大量丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。由于钴基催化剂的优异性能和地球钴元素的丰富，它们正被开发用于PDH。一种创新的催化剂设计策略是活性位点隔离策略，它提高了PDH中的催化性能。通过两步法合成了在硅酸锂-1沸石上支撑的氮掺杂碳层中空间隔离的钴氧化物位点(记为CoOx@NC/S-1)，在PDH中表现出优异的催化性能，丙烷转化率高，丙烯选择性高，在600摄氏度下PDH反应10小时后没有明显的失活。
