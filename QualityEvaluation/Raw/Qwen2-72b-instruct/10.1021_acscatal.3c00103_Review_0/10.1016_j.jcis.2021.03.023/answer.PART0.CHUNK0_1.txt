1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundant in shale gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the abundance of cobalt on Earth, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. A specific example is the synthesis of spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1). This catalyst shows exceptional performance for PDH, with a propane conversion of 40% and propene selectivity of over 97%, and it exhibits no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过将丰富的页岩气沉积物中的丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。由于钴基催化剂在PDH中表现出色，且地球上钴元素丰富，因此正在开发用于PDH的钴基催化剂。一种创新的催化剂设计策略是活性位点隔离策略，它提高了PDH中的催化性能。一个具体的例子是合成在硅酸锂-1沸石上氮掺杂碳层中的空间隔离钴氧化物位点(CoOx@NC/S-1)。这种催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性超过97%，并且在600摄氏度下PDH反应10小时后没有明显的失活。
