1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundant in shale gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the abundance of cobalt on Earth, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the isolation of active sites to enhance catalytic performance. Specifically, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, with a propane conversion of 40% and propene selectivity of over 97%, and shows no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过将丰富的页岩气沉积物中的丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法的局限性。由于钴基催化剂在PDH中表现出色，且地球上钴元素丰富，因此正在开发用于PDH的钴基催化剂。一种创新的催化剂设计策略是隔离活性位点，以增强催化性能。具体而言，通过两步法合成了在硅酸锂-1沸石上支撑的氮掺杂碳层中的空间隔离钴氧化物位点（CoOx@NC/S-1）。这种催化剂在PDH中表现出优异的催化性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性超过97%，并且在600摄氏度下进行10小时的PDH反应后没有明显的失活。
