In addition to pure metal catalysts, a few theoretical studies have been employed to investigate the mechanism on Ni catalysts with supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts for DRM reaction with improved performance. The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering.196 The DFT studies of Rodriguez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15). The electronic or chemical properties of Ni were modified with CeO2 through strong metalsupport interactions. The strong interactions enhanced the Ni reactivity for methane dissociation and probably prevented carbon deposition and deactivation during DRM.197 Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations. This suggests that the reduction degree of the CeO2 or oxygen vacancy is vital for the activity of Ni/Co sites. The Ni/Co cation on CeO2 shows a much lower activity for CH activation of methane compared to the Ni/Co cation on reduced CeO2 (Ce2O3). CO2 dissociation was observed to take place on the oxide surface at 700 K, under DRM conditions, and no coke deposition was found in the catalytic cycle. CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process. In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies.199 The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation. The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane. However, the whole catalytic cycle involving the oxygen vacancy was not analyzed. It is highly desired to analyze the elementary reaction steps at the metaloxide interface in the catalytic cycle to gain a better understanding of the role of the interface in DRM.

Foppa et al.200 employed a multiscale (DFT and microkinetic) modeling approach to investigate the role of a Ni/Al2O3 interface in WGS (watergas shift) and DRM. The Ni/Al2O3 interface provided the active site for WGS, while all Ni atoms were active for DRM, which was confirmed by the experimental measurements. Li et al.201 combined DFT, CO2-TPD, and in situ DRIFTS to investigate the interfacial synergism of Ni/La2O3 catalysts towards CO2 activation in DRM. They proposed a mechanism that CH4 activation occurred on the Ni surface to form H2 and activated coke precursors. CO2 activation took place at the Ni/La2O3 interface to generate bidentate carbonate. Then bidentate carbonate underwent a reaction with adjacent activated coke precursors to generate CO. Therefore, carbon deposition was avoided at the Ni/La2O3 interface. The more the Ni/La2O3 interface existed, the better the stability by inhibiting the coke deposition.
Li et al.202 combined DFT and microkinetic modeling to investigate the DRM reaction mechanism on a Ni(111) surface with La and La2O3 as promoters. For La modified Ni(111), the dominant pathway was CH4 + CO2  CH + 3H + CO + O  CHO + 3H + CO  2CO + 2H2, with CH + O  CHO as the RDS. For La2O3 modified Ni(111), CH4 + CO2 + La2O3  CH + CO2(La2O2O) + 3H CHO + CO2(La2O2) + 3H  2CO + 2H2 + La2O3 was the dominant reaction pathway, with CH4  CH3 + H as the RDS. The modified catalysts improved the DRM reaction both thermodynamically and kinetically. Moreover, the carbon deposition was inhibited on La2O3 modified Ni(111) because of the lower reaction rate in CH  C + H, compared to that on La modified Ni(111).
For Ni-based bimetallic catalysts, NiSn was observed to favor methane dissociation,203 and reduce coke formation204 more than pure Ni catalysts for DRM via both theoretical and experimental studies. NiFe bimetallic catalysts suppressed coke deposition due to the increased energy barrier of CH  C + H, in comparison to that on a pure Ni(111) surface.205 Furthermore, under DRM conditions, Fe was oxidized partially to FeO, leading to a partial dealloying. FeO could react with surface carbon deposits to form CO, where the reduced Fe returned to the original NiFe alloy.205,206 The FeO/Ni(111) interface exhibited easier CO bond cleavage of CO2 and dehydrogenation of CHx (x = 13). Therefore, both improved DRM reactivity and coke resistance were obtained on NiFe catalysts. The Ni2Cu(111) catalyst displayed superior carbon deposition resistance compared to Ni(111) and Ni2Fe(111) due to the higher energy barrier of CH dissociation. It could also improve carbon elimination by enhancing C* + O* reaction, resulting in improved catalyst stability.207 NiPt bimetallic catalysts showed higher reaction barriers for CH cracking and lower carbon adsorption energy than that on pure Ni(111), which decreased the possibility of coke formation. It can be concluded that the use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts can effectively suppress coke formation on Ni surfaces. Meanwhile, some supports, such as CeO2, promoters such as La2O3, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts such as NiSn and NiFe can improve the metal activity for DRM due to enhanced methane activation.
2.2.3 Partial oxidation of methane Partial oxidation of methane is another process for synthesis gas production, which can also be used to produce methanol.208,209 Herein, we only focus on the POM to synthesis gas. This process, like SRM, has a long history but has attracted much less attention until the 1990s.48,69 Owing to its thermodynamic advantages and the produced H2/CO ratio of 2, which is desired for downstream methanol and FischerTropsch (FT) synthesis, POM may become increasingly important in methane conversion and as an attractive alternative to SRM which may applied in industry in the future.38,210 Despite its exothermicity, high temperatures (11001200 K) are required to obtain H2 and CO. The high temperatures make the reaction difficult to control. Moreover, the hot spots formed during this process are difficult to handle and might cause local overheating. These issues, coupled with the danger of a mixture of methane and oxygen, result in the main problems (safety issues) of POM. Additionally, catalyst stability is another factor that hinders this process from being industrialized.42 In this review, the POM mechanisms on TMs are summarized, mainly from theoretical points of view based on DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, and kinetic analysis. Metal dependence of the reaction mechanism Although many studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanism of POM reaction, the mechanism of synthesis gas formation is not yet completely clarified. In the literature, two reaction mechanisms have been proposed for POM reaction: one is the direct partial oxidation (DPO) mechanism, in which CH4 and O2 react on the catalyst surface to generate CO and H2 directly; and the other is the combustion and reforming reaction (CRR) mechanism, which involves total methane combustion to form H2O and CO2 first, followed by SRM and DRM to produce CO and H2.38,48,69,70,211,212 The latter mechanism was suggested by Prettre et al.213 as early as 1945, but due to the highly desired direct selective route to produce synthesis gas, significant efforts have been made towards investigating whether this can be achieved in practice.69
Rh and Pt are two of the most widely used catalysts in POM reaction.214 The first simulations on POM over Pt and Rh surfaces were reported by Hickmann and Schmidt,69,215,216 using a model with 19 elementary steps containing adsorption, desorption, and surface reactions. The reaction parameters were obtained from the literature or from fitting to previous experiments. The model results demonstrated that at high temperatures with CH4-rich conditions, CO and H2 were primary products of direct methane oxidation via a pyrolysis mechanism. The superiority of Rh over Pt towards the direct oxidation of methane to CO and H2 was due primarily to the much lower activation barrier of OH formation from O* and H* on Pt than that on Rh (0.11 eV for Pt vs. 0.87 eV for Rh).
Boucouvalas et al.217 conducted a kinetic study of POM over supported Rh catalysts. The calculated apparent activation energy of CO2 formation was around 0.35 eV, which was close to that of methane conversion (0.39 eV). In contrast, the apparent activation energy of CO formation was 0.881.13 eV, close to those for CO production from SRM and DRM,123,217219 and much higher than that for CO2 formation. It was suggested that the POM followed an indirect (CRR) mechanism; namely, the reaction initially involved total oxidation of methane to CO2 and H2O, followed by reforming reactions to synthesis gas. The kinetic study reported by Kondratenko et al.210 also illustrated that CO and H2 were mainly produced through SRM and DRM at least in the case of complete oxygen conversion. Donazzi et al.143 carried out a kinetic study of POM over a Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst, with SRM, DRM, WGS, reverse-WGS, CO and H2 combustion tests also conducted to refine the study. It was found that under the POM conditions the kinetic role of DRM is negligible; therefore SRM and CH4 total combustion account for the consumption of methane.
Mallens et al.220 employed a transient kinetic study to investigate the reaction mechanism of POM to synthesis gas over Pt. The methane decomposition took place on reduced platinum and resulted in surface C* and H*, which produced CO and CO2 in parallel by the involvement of different oxygen species. In the presence of both CH4 and O2 at a stoichiometric feed ratio, the major reaction pathways were the direct formation of H2 and CO followed by their consecutive oxidation. Based on the study, a Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) redox cycle221 was postulated for POM over Pt: the methane oxidation was accompanied by the reduction of platinum oxide, which was re-oxidized via incorporation of dioxygen into the catalyst.
In view of the controversy in the POM mechanism, it is of great significance to further elucidate the reaction from a microscopic perspective. Mhadeshwar and Vlachos222 developed a thermodynamically consistent C1 microkinetic model for POM, SRM, DRM, and oxygenate decomposition on Rh using a hierarchical multiscale methodology with parameters obtained from combined UBI-QEP and DFT calculations. The model predicted distinct oxidation and reforming zones, where CO and H2O were the primary products that existed in the oxidation zone. H2 was produced from methane reforming by H2O generated in the oxidation zone. Matteo et al.223 integrated a microkinetic model224 with detailed reactor models225 to investigate the dominant reaction pathways for syngas production in POM on Rh. Three reaction zones were suggested: deep combustion of a methane zone (O* is the most abundant reactive intermediate), followed by a zone where both direct formation of synthesis gas and catalytic combustion occur, and, finally, a SRM and WGS zone (oxygen is no longer available). Zone II and zone III were supported by the microkinetic study of spatially resolved autothermal POM experiments reported by Donazzi et al.226 over Rh-coated foams. Besides, the reaction pathway analysis of Donazzi et al.226 showed that methane was activated via pyrolytic decomposition, and the main oxidizer was OH* rather than O*. In the oxidation zone (zone II), OH* was generated from O* and H* combination, while in the reforming zone (zone III), OH* was formed by H2O dissociation.
Mhadeshwar and Vlachos214 developed a predictive CH4 (C1) mechanism on Pt by using a hierarchical multiscale approach. They concluded that POM on Pt was indirect, where total oxidation occurred first to form CO2 and H2O, followed by SRM and DRM to generate CO and H2, consistent with modeled experimental data. The combined kinetic and DFT studies of CH4 oxidation on Pt and Rh clusters by Chin et al.227 confirmed that POM to CO and H2 followed an indirect mechanism at the molecular scale. CO and H2 were predominantly produced upon complete O2 consumption from the sequential reforming steps. Based on the above kinetic and microkinetic studies, it is generally accepted that there is no unified mechanism of POM to synthesis gas and that even for the same catalyst the process might follow different reaction routes depending on the reaction conditions and the state of the catalyst.
Au et al.228 gave a detailed theoretical study of POM to synthesis gas on Ni, Pd, Pt and Cu catalysts, where adsorption energies were calculated using the Amsterdam density functional (ADF) program system, and activation energies were estimated by the UBI-QEP method. These metals were simulated by Ni7, Pd10, Pt10, and Cu10 clusters. The calculated total methane dissociation energies followed the trend of Ni < Pd  Pt, corresponding to the experimental tendency in methane conversions as Ni > Pd  Pt. The rather high activation energy of discrete dehydrogenation steps on Cu explains why Cu is not active for methane dissociation. C* + O*  CO* was the RDS on Ni due to the higher activation energy than those of dehydrogenations (CHx,s  CHx1,s). On the other hand, on Pd, Pt, and Cu, CH* dissociation (CH*  C* + H*) was the RDS because of the highest activation energies. The calculation also indicated that gas-phase CO could easily combine with O* to form CO2. The CO2 selectivity was, therefore, dependent on the amount of adsorbed O* present on the surface. High CO selectivity can be obtained in an oxygen-depleted environment.
Metal dependence of the activity Like SRM, POM reaction is active on noble metals such as Rh, Ru, Ir, Pt, and Pd, with Rh and Ru being the most active, and on non-noble metals like Ni and Co.38,42,70,210,211 For non-noble metal catalysts, Ni-based catalysts display the highest activity, which is even comparable to that of noble metal catalysts.42 Nevertheless, rapid catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition as well as loss and sintering of Ni under POM reaction conditions is a major problem that occurred on Ni-based catalysts.141 Consistent with the mechanism of POM with total oxidation followed with SRM, the activity order of POM on these metals is similar to that of SRM, namely Rh  Ru > Ni  Ir  Pt, Pd,48,127,210 which has been discussed in Section 2.2.1. The relative order of carbon formation was observed as Ni > Pd  Rh, Ru, Ir, Pt, reported by Claridge and Battle et al.48,229 Yoo et al.95 employed DFT and microkinetic modeling to investigate methane oxidation to CO, CO2, CH2O, and CH3OH over a Pd(111) surface under mildly oxidizing conditions. CO and CH2O were found to be the main products. The CO selectivity was greater than 0.5 and normally increased with increasing temperature, while the CH2O selectivity was less than 0.4 with a maximum at 550 K. In addition to Pd(111), the authors also extended the study to other metal fcc(111) surfaces by employing linear scaling relations in the microkinetic model. The obtained volcano plots of the product reaction rates are given in Fig. 16. Pd, Pt, and Rh(111) surfaces were selective to CO and/or CH2O productions, where the metallic site led to CO production, and the surface O* site led to CH2O production. Ag, Au, and Cu(111) surfaces were selective to CH2O and/or CH3OH productions, with the O*-assisted mechanism preferred for all dehydrogenation steps.

Catalysts improving carbon formation resistance Like SRM and DRM, carbon deposition is a commonly encountered phenomenon occurring in the POM process that results in catalyst deactivation, especially for Ni-based catalysts. The application of bimetallic catalysts could effectively reduce the carbon deposition problem and sometimes also improve the catalyst activity. For instance, the DFT calculations of He et al.230 revealed an improved performance of Ni by alloying it with Co, which enhanced both catalyst activity and carbon formation resistance for methane oxidation. Alloying Ni with Cu could also improve the catalyst carbon formation resistance but with reduced activity as a cost.
Concerning direct partial oxidation to synthesis gas, theoretical studies mainly focus on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts rather than traditional bimetallic catalysts. Zhang et al.141 investigated the effect of Ni(111) alloying with Pt on this reaction via a DFT study. It was found that by doping Pt on Ni(111) methane dissociation was greatly promoted. However, the activation energy of CO formation (RDS: CH + O  CHO) and that of H2 formation (H + H  H2) were both observed to increase on the NiPt(111) surface, indicating that alloying Ni(111) with Pt might cause suppressed CO and H2 production. The results demonstrated that NiPt bimetallic catalysts were beneficial to methane adsorption and dissociation and atomic C/H adsorption, but might be less favorable for synthesis gas formation.71,141 Meng et al.90 investigated POM to synthesis gas over a D-Pd/Cu(111) (doped Pd/Cu(111)) catalyst and over an A-Pd/Cu(111) (adsorbed Pd/Cu(111)) catalyst via DFT calculations. Through comparison, the D-Pd/Cu(111) catalyst showed more thermodynamic stability and exhibited a higher capacity for sintering resistance. In their other study,231 Pt was doped on Cu(111) and Ni(111) surfaces to understand the bimetallic catalyst activity and coke-resistance during POM using DFT calculations. Fig. 17 gives a comparison of methane dissociation reaction pathways on Cu(111), Ni(111), Pt1Cu(111) and Pt1Ni(111) surfaces. The activation barriers of CH4 dissociation were largely reduced by the introduction of a single Pt atom on the Cu(111) surface. Compared to Pt1Ni(111) and Ni(111), Pt1Cu(111) displayed similar activation barriers of CH4 dissociation to CH3, but a higher barrier of CH dehydrogenation to C. These results indicated that Pt1Cu(111) can effectively promote methane activation, but not affect the excellent coke resistance. Towards CO formation, the dominant pathway was CH  CHO  CO on both Pt1Cu(111) and Pt1Ni(111), with CH + O  CHO as the RDS. The lower activation energy of CH + O  CHO on Pt1Cu(111) than on Pt1Ni(111) illustrated a higher potential of CO formation on Pt1Cu(111), which prevented C formation and resulted in a better coke-resistance. The performance of the Pt single-alloy Cu catalyst was significantly enhanced, compared with that of commercial Ni-based catalysts.

In addition to bimetallic catalysts, the employment of supports could also effectively improve the performance of the catalysts. Guo et al.232 investigated methane dissociation and partial oxidation on Rh4/Ana-Ov (oxygen-defective anatase TiO2 supported Rh) and Rh4/Rut-Ov (rutile TiO2 supported Rh) by DFT, with emphasis put on carbon deposition resistance. Rh4/Ana-Ov showed a higher activation barrier of CH bond breaking in methane decomposition and a lower energy barrier of CH2 + O  CH2O (RDS for CO formation) compared to that on Rh4/Rut-Ov, implying a strong carbon deposition resistance and a high synthesis gas formation activity of the Rh4/Ana-Ov catalyst. The microkinetic modeling of Rh4/Ana-Ov illustrated a high (up to 90%) CO selectivity, which was increased with temperature. In another study of Guo et al.,233 DFT calculations were used to analyze the size-dependent carbon deposition resistance of Rh-clusters supported on anatase (Rhx/Ana-Ov) for POM. Rh1/Ana-Ov, Rh4/Ana-Ov, and Rh13/Ana-Ov were applied to simulate different cluster sizes. It was found that Rh1/Ana-Ov displayed a much higher apparent energy barrier of methane dissociation and lower energy barrier of CH2 + O  CH2O (RDS for CO formation) among the three models, which could be the one owing to the strong carbon deposition resistance and high catalytic activity. Therefore, SAA catalysts were suggested as candidates to reduce carbon deposition for POM processes.
Size dependence of activity The kinetic study of Kondratenko et al.210 investigated the size effect on activity and selectivity for POM to synthesis gas over γ-Al2O3 supported Rh NPs. As the particle size increased, the methane conversion and H2/CO ratio were decreased. Meanwhile, the apparent TOF of CO formation and CO selectivity were strongly reduced, indicating a size-dependent kinetics of this process on the supported Rh NPs. However, the overall mechanism of POM was size-independent, which mainly followed an indirect (CRR) mechanism through methane combustion and reforming to form CO and H2.
According to the above kinetic, DFT and microkinetic studies, the mechanism of POM to synthesis gas is still under debate. The exothermic property of POM reaction makes it a challenge to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, owing to the potential of POM in methane conversion, there is a great possibility to attract more attention to this process in the future.
2.3 Methane conversion on oxides
There are extensive pieces of literature on methane activation over various oxide catalysts, some of which have been reviewed previously39,63,234239 and among which methane oxidation was found to be the most studied reaction. Methane oxidation catalysis involves the introduction of methane and gaseous molecular oxygen into the reactor. Since both the adsorbed oxygen from the gas phase and lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst can possibly participate in the reactions, it is essential to understand the relative role between them. It was earlier proposed that, instead of the adsorbed oxygen from the gas phase, the concentration of lattice oxygen controls the selectivity of the metal oxide catalyst for total oxidation.239,240 This opinion is consistent with the MVK mechanism.
As early as 1993, Otsuka et al.241 reported that CeO2 could be used as an oxidant to transform methane into synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2 at 8731073 K. During the redox cycle of cerium oxide, methane was directly converted to CO and H2, and CeO2 was partially reduced to CeO2n, as shown in eqn (6): CeO2 + nCH4  CeO2n + nCO + 2nH2 (6) The reduced CeO2n could be used to convert CO2 into CO, with oxygen recovery to CeO2, as shown in eqn (7): CeO2n + nCO2  CeO2 + nCO (7) The addition of Pt to CeO2 accelerated the formation of synthesis gas, while the H2/CO ratio became higher than 2 when the reduction of the Pt-doped CeO2 catalyst was over 60 min, which implied coke formation on the cerium oxide surface after a period of reduction.
Encouraged by experimental results on CeO2 oxides, methane oxidation has been studied by DFT calculations on CeO2,110,242 and CeO2 doped with Zr or Pd,110,242,243 and Pt.113 As discussed in Section 2.1.2, the CH bond activation of methane is well correlated with the surface reducibility of CeO2 measured by the formation energy of O vacancy. A comparative study of methane oxidation was performed by a DFT+U on PdxCe1xO2(111), CeO2(111) and PdO(100) surfaces.242 The reaction mechanism is similar to that on transition-metal surfaces, where methane oxidation took place via CH4  CH3*  CH2*  CH*  HCO*  CO*  CO2 at low coverage as shown in the free energy diagrams in Fig. 18. CH bond activation in methane is the RDS on all three surfaces. Carbon formation was not favored over any surface, and the formation of POM products was also not thermodynamically favorable, which, however, was different from the results obtained by Otsuka et al.241 that synthesis gas was the primary product on the CeO2 surface.

Ce is displayed as tan (light), Pd as light blue (gray), O as red (dark), and H as white.242 Reproduced from ref. 242 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2011.
Importantly, doping CeO2 with Zr or Pd,110,242,243 and Pt113 decreased the formation energy of O vacancy of the neighboring oxygen atoms and thus reduced the CH activation energy barrier. Doping with metals is an effective method to increase the activity of CH bond activation. The methane activation barrier was the lowest on the PdxCe1xO2(111) surface, lower than those on CeO2(111), PdO(100), and Pd*/CeO2(111), and even lower than those on Pd(111) and stepped and kinked Pd(211) surfaces.243 Jin et al.244 conducted experimental and theoretical studies of oxidation of ventilation air methane on Fe2O3 and CuO catalysts. The mechanism schematics of CH4 oxidation on the two surfaces are given in Fig. 19(a), together with calculated reaction energies. They implied that CH4 dissociation was the RDS, with reaction energies as 2.76 eV for Fe2O3(0001) and 0.47 eV for CuO(110), due to the strong CH bonding. It also revealed that the oxygen vacancy (OV) could recover quickly when additional O2 molecules reached the metal oxide surface conducting adsorption and dissociation. Therefore, the reduction of Fe2O3 and CuO could rarely occur, which remained stable without transition to the reduced phase. The schematic configurations of surface bonding for methane oxidation on the O-terminated Fe2O3(0001) are presented in Fig. 19(b). An OV was generated when H2O was released (Fig. 19b(AC)), followed by O2 filling in the OV to generate FeOO (Fig. 19b(D)). The formation of CO bonding in Fig. 19b(F) was favorable to activate the CH bond of CHx due to the spontaneous transfer of the CO single bond to the CO double bond with the breakage of CH. The DOS profiles in their work showed that OVs generated more local states over reduced metal surfaces, which were the active sites for O2 adsorption and thus made the CH activation and O2 splitting more feasible. The under-coordinated metal atoms and OVs could stabilize CHx radicals to promote CH4 dissociation (RDS), which are therefore essential for potential high-performance CH4 oxidation catalysts.

In addition to the above metal oxide catalysts, IrO2 was also reported to be an effective catalyst to activate the CH bond of methane.245 According to the DFT study of Yeh et al.,246 formaldehyde formation was the most favorable reaction for methane oxidation. The reaction was limited by formaldehyde desorption, with a desorption energy of 1.10 eV on an IrO2(110) surface, and the reaction barrier was lower than 0.70 eV. An external electric field was employed to modify the reactivity of IrO2(110), which was found to have no apparent influence on methane dehydrogenation and CO coupling but could regulate the desorption energy of the adsorbates, especially promoting methane oxidation to formaldehyde over an O-rich IrO2(110) surface.
Despite the most cases that lattice O was favorable for methane oxidation, surface oxygen adsorbed or activated O played an important role in the POM reaction on oxides with high formation energies of oxygen vacancy, such as MoO3(100)247 and SiO2 surfaces.248 Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have stimulated interest in various redox cycle reactions (e.g. methane oxidation) due to their excellent crystal structure and redox reversibility.249251 Methane oxidation has been studied on LaFeO3 based perovskites by DFT calculations focused on the active sites and oxygen mobility and their effects on catalyst activity and selectivity.252,253 The mechanism and structure requirements of selective and total oxidation of methane in a chemical looping process are both experimentally and theoretically examined on La0.5Sr0.5Fe1xCoxO3δ perovskites. The substitution of Sr for La at the A site and the substitution of Co for Fe at the B site of the ABO3 perovskites significantly reduced the formation energy of oxygen vacancy. The lattice O diffusion rate and the activity of methane conversion increased, and the selectivity decreased upon decreasing the formation energy of oxygen vacancy. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy increased upon increasing the lattice oxygen charge. Recently, Zhang et al.252 employed combined electrical conductivity relaxation measurements and DFT calculations to study the influence of FeO6 octahedral distortion on lattice oxygen in La1xCexFeO3 perovskites for POM coupled with a CO2 splitting process. It was found that changing the content of Ce3+ substitution in La1xCexFeO3 (x = 0, 0.25 0.5, 0.75, 1) resulted in a change in FeO bond-length variance, which could tune the FeO6 octahedral distortion degree in La1xCexFeO3, activate the lattice oxygen and significantly improve the catalysts performance in chemical looping POM-CO2 splitting.
Methane oxidation on spinel structured oxides such as CaFe2O4254 and NiCo2O4255 was studied experimentally and theoretically. The deep reduction of calcium ferrite facilitated the production of synthesis gas through methane dehydrogenation and selective oxidation of C to CO. The mechanism difference of POM to form CO and H2 with the CaFe2O4 carrier can be associated with the differences in the oxide phases existing during the reduction process, oxygen species concentration, and bonding in the lattice structure.254 The metal total combustion on NiCo2O4 was observed to follow (1) O2 dissociation on surface O vacancies; (2) the dissociated O atoms filled into O vacancies and coupled with H atoms to form OH and H2O; (3) CH4 dissociation to form CH3* on Ni cations with a subsequent oxidation to CH3O*; (4) CH3O* dehydrogenation to form CH2O* with a subsequent ODH (with the O species of the nearby Co site) to form CHO*; and (5) transformation of CHO* to products (CO2 and H2O) via two subpathways including OCHO dehydrogenation and CO oxidation. The high activity of NiCo2O4 in CH4 conversion to H2O and CO2 at a relatively low temperature together with its low cost leads to NiCo2O4 being very promising for the removal of CH4 in the exhaust gas of a natural gas engine through complete oxidation.
Unlike the extensive literature reported for methane oxidation, only a few theoretical studies have been conducted for SRM and DRM reactions on oxide catalysts, such as SRM on a Ce0.90Ni0.05Ru0.05O2 (CNR) catalyst,256 and DRM on Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore (LRhZ),257 NiOMgO,258 and NiCaO.259 In SRM and DRM, the metal oxides are normally used as supports to favor possible H2O92,200,260,261 or CO2 activation40,189,262,263 coupled with methane activation on transition metal surfaces. The relatively high activity and low cost of Ni-based catalysts, as well as good performance of other metal catalysts for SRM and DRM, make the research mainly focused on metal surfaces.
3. CH bond activation in ethane
Ethylene is the most critical chemical building block which could be applied to synthesize various downstream products. It can be produced by noncatalytic thermal dehydrogenation, catalytic dehydrogenation, and oxidative dehydrogenation. Steam cracking is still the dominating route for industrial production of ethylene, but other technologies have also gained increasing attention. Several excellent reviews have addressed the progress in ethane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.3,264273 Here we summarize the progress of theoretical catalysis on CH activation of ethane.
3.1 Ethane dehydrogenation on metal surfaces
Ethane is physisorbed on various metal and metal oxide surfaces, and the composition of the catalyst changes the physisorption very much. The CH bond activation of ethane is similar to the CH activation of methane and follows the universal scaling relationship of the activation energy of CH activation of light alkanes. The CH activation of ethane deals with the secondary C sp3H bond cleavage. The CH activation energy of ethane is generally lower than the one of methane, due to the weaker strength of 2 than 1 CH bonds.
3.1.1 Reaction mechanism The exact reaction mechanism of dehydrogenation of ethane is still under debate, due to the fact that a large variety of materials can catalyze this reaction. The 4 step HoriutiPolanyi mechanism is commonly used to describe the dehydrogenation mechanism on metal surfaces.274 It consists of 4 main steps: dissociative adsorption of alkanes, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, the formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin. Both the dissociative adsorption of ethane and CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom275277 have been suggested as the RDSs. Pt is the most active pure metal for ethane dehydrogenation to produce ethylene, due to its superior activity towards CH bond activation and low activity towards CC bond cleavage.278 On the Pt surface, it is generally accepted that the reaction goes through ethane dehydrogenation to ethyl, CH3CH2*, then to ethylene, while the non-selective pathway to methane and deeply dehydrogenated species is predicted to go through dehydrogenation via CH3CH*.
The geometries of the transition states for activation of ethane and ethyl CH bonds on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces are shown in Fig. 20, with the corresponding activation barriers summarized in Table 1.279 The CH bond activation of ethane on both surfaces occurs through the simultaneous interaction of C and H with a surface Pt atom, forming a CPtH three-membered ring structure (Fig. 20a and d). The CPtH three-membered ring structures are also found in ethyl to ethylene on both surfaces (Fig. 20c and f) and ethyl to CH3CH* on the Pt(211) surface (Fig. 20e). For the transition states of ethyl to CH3CH* on the Pt(111) surface, ethyl is bonded to Pt surfaces via the C atom, where the H in CH is bonded to adjunct Pt (Fig. 20b). The energy barriers of the three steps follow the order Pt(211) < Pt(111), as shown in Table 1. Similarly, the energy barriers of Pt(433) step < Pt(433) terrace,280 and Pt55 < Pt(111)281 are obtained. The stepped Pt surfaces (or small Pt particles) having coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms are therefore kinetically more active for the dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene than the flat surfaces.Fig. 20 Geometries of the transition states for the activation of ethane and ethyl CH bonds on Pt(111): (a) CH3CH2H, (b) CH3CHH, and (c) CH2CH2H; and on Pt(211): (c) CH3CH2H, (d) CH3CHH, and (e) CH2CH2H.279 Reproduced from ref. 279 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2010.Table 1 Calculated energy barriers (Eact) for ethane and ethyl dehydrogenation on different metal surfaces Surface Eact (eV) XC functional k points Unit cell Ref.CH3CH3(g)  CH3CH2* CH3CH2*  CH3CH* CH3CH2*  CH2CH2* Pt(111) 0.54 0.88 0.81 PBE 5 × 5 × 1 2 × 2 279 Pt(211) 0.08 0.27 0.44 3 × 4 × 1 2 × 1 Pt(110)-(1 × 2) 0.38 0.33 0.29 PW91  2 × 2 285 and 286 Pt(433) terrace 0.65 0.81 0.71 PW91 1 × 2 × 1 1 × 3 280 Pt(433) step 0.33 0.08 0.27 Al6O11 decorated Pt(433) 0.69 0.78 0.73 Pt(111) 0.84  0.67 PBE 3 × 3 × 1 4 × 4 281 Pt55 0.57  0.48 1 × 1 × 1 Pt(111) 0.91 0.91 0.89 PW91 6 × 6 × 1 2 × 2 282 and 283 Pt3Sn/Pt(111) 1.19 1.04 1.07 PtSn/Pt(111) 1.58 1.28 1.28 Pt(111) 0.90 0.95 0.88 PW91 6 × 6 × 1 2 × 2 284 Pt3Sn/Pt(111) 1.18 1.30 1.08 Pt3Sn(111) 1.08 0.84 0.88 In addition to activity, ethylene selectivity is another important factor in characterizing ethane dehydrogenation. From Table 1, one can see that the energy barrier of CH3CH2*  CH3CH* is lower than that of CH3CH2*  CH2CH2* for both the Pt(211) and Pt(433) steps. It means that these under-coordinated step sites preferably promote deep dehydrogenation, resulting in coke formation and catalyst deactivation.280 By decorating the step with AlOx species (Al6O11 decorated Pt(433)), the step sites can be blocked, leading to suppression of deep dehydrogenation and coke formation. The deep hydrogenation can also be suppressed by doping Pt with Sn. As shown in Table 1, PtSn surface alloys with different site coverages of Sn and PtSn bulk alloy have been investigated for ethane dehydrogenation via DFT calculations.282284 The activation energies of the first and second CH bond cleavage steps for ethylene formation were calculated as Pt(111) < Pt3Sn(111) (bulk alloy) < Pt3Sn/Pt(111) (surface alloy) < PtSn/Pt(111) (surface alloy). The addition of Sn into Pt increases the CH and CC bond cleavage barriers, which inhibits the catalyst activity but favors ethylene selectivity over carbon formation. A more detailed discussion on the site coverage of Sn and the location of the Sn on Pt catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation can be seen in Section 3.1.2.Nrskov and co-workers287 developed a descriptor based microkinetic model for ethane dehydrogenation over close-packed metal surfaces and varied reaction conditions. The C2H4 turnover frequency and selectivity can be predicted as functions of the adsorption energies of two key intermediates CH3CH* and CH2CH2*. The model results showed that Pt and Pt alloys were among the most active catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 21(a). The catalytic activity followed the order IrPt3  Pt > Re > Ir > Ru > Rh > Ni, Co, while Cu, Zn, Au, In, and Ag were almost inactive. The SnPt and ZnPt alloys showed reasonable activity, but it was lower than that of Pt. The Sn and Zn alloyed with Pt lowered the adsorption strength of CH2CH2*, and thus significantly enhanced ethylene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 21(b). The activity trend predicted by micro-kinetic modeling is in general agreement with experimental results.Fig. 21 (a) Activity volcano for ethylene production at 873 K, 0.2 bar C2H6(g), 2 × 104 bar C2H4 (1% carbon conversion), 0.6 bar H2(g), and 109 bar CH4 and 1012 bar C2H2. (b) Map of carbon-specific selectivity.287 Reproduced from ref. 287 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2019.Bell and co-workers288 applied tetrahedral metal clusters in DFT calculations to represent metal NPs to study the elementary processes involved in ethane dehydrogenation. The DFT estimated free energy activation barrier for the dissociative adsorption of ethane to present activity trend followed Pt3Sn > Pt3Ir > Pt4, which agreed relatively well with the experimentally measured activity order. The same group investigated the effects of intermetallic interaction on alkane dehydrogenation systematically using Pt-based, subnanometer-sized alloy cluster catalysts.289 The alloys were modeled with Pt3X (X = Pd, Sn, Ge, Si, In, Ga, Au, Ag, Cu, and Ir). For all the alloy catalysts, the RDS was found to be the same, namely the first CH bond cleavage. The activation energy of the first CH cleavage on the alloy clusters was predicted to be in the order of Pt3Si < Pt3Ge < Pt3Sn < Pt3Ir < Pt. No significant BEP relationship could be found with respect to atomic H or CH3 group binding energy for the Pt alloys. However, the catalyst activity correlated well with the HOMOLUMO gap of the clean catalyst. Smaller HOMOLUMO gaps indicated higher activity due to the increased flexibility of the valence electron at the active site.
3.1.2 Effect of promoters on selectivity and deactivation Unpromoted Pt catalysts suffer from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coking. Both undesired phenomena are mainly a consequence of deep dehydrogenation of surface C2H4*, leading to CC bond breaking.275277 Improvements of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be achieved by alloying Pt with Sn and by adding hydrogen to the alkane feed.277,282284 Pt alloys have been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically. DFT calculations have been used to provide a molecular understanding of those promoters for improving ethylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Alloys of Pt with Sn, Zn, Ga, Ge, and In have been widely studied, and PtSn is the most studied system. Experiments showed that PtIr and PtSn had higher ethylene selectivity than Pt, and PtIr exhibited better stability to coke deposition than PtSn.288 Microkinetic modeling287 and the cluster model267,289 suggested a higher selectivity of PtSn compared to Pt. However, the sub-nanometer cluster model288,289 predicted the selectivity trend. The cluster model predicted a higher CH cleavage activation energy of ethylene and thus high activation energy of CC cleavage, which resulted in a high ethylene selectivity and better stability on Pt3Ir than Pt, in good agreement with experimental observation.
The cluster model289 predicted relatively high ethylene selectivity on Pt-based catalysts due to their relatively high barriers for direct CC bond cleavage compared to CH bond breaking. A natural bond orbital analysis revealed that the d-orbital shape of the HOMO with its pronounced nodal features better facilitated the breaking of a CH bond than that of a CC bond due to better overlap with the CH anti-binding orbital.
The site coverage of Sn and the location of the Sn on Pt catalyst do influence the catalyst performances for ethane dehydrogenation.282284 Kinetic reaction barriers were calculated for potential energy surfaces of C1 and C2 intermediates from CH and CC bond cleavage of ethane with  and  surface monolayers of Sn.282 Sn weakened the binding energies of all species at both coverages. At the lower Sn coverage ( monolayer), the effect was purely electronic since the binding geometries had not changed compared to those on the Pt(111) surface. At the higher coverage of Sn, a larger effect on reaction energies was observed due to the changes in the binding geometries as a result of the elimination of 3-fold hollow sites that consist of Pt atoms. In terms of the electronic effect, Sn can donate electrons to Pt atoms and reduce the binding energies of adsorbates to Pt and increase the barrier for CH and CC cleavage, as shown in Table 1. The increase in the barriers favors ethylene selectivity over carbon formation. The same group further studied the effect of tin in the bulk of PtSn alloys for ethane dehydrogenation.284 DFT calculations were performed on pristine Pt(111), a Pt3Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, and a Pt3Sn(111) bulk alloy. The binding energies of adsorbates weakened on both Sn alloys. But on the bulk alloy, the binding energy was weaker than that on pure Pt but stronger than that on the surface alloy. Therefore, the activity trend for ethylene formation was predicted as pure Pt > bulk alloy > surface alloy based on the activation energies of the first and second CH bond cleavage steps (Table 1). A selectivity descriptor was defined for ethane dehydrogenation as the energy difference between the activation energy for ethylene dehydrogenation (Ea, CH2CH2*  CH2CH*) and the desorption energy of ethylene (ΔEdes, CH2CH2*) for several substitutional surface alloys. A smaller value indicates that further ethylene dehydrogenation is more favored over desorption and therefore predicts poor selectivity towards ethylene. The selectivity descriptor was calculated as 0.12, 0.04, and +0.36 eV for Pt, the bulk alloy, and the surface alloy, respectively. Therefore, the ethylene selectivity was highest on the surface alloy, followed by the bulk alloy and pure Pt.
The selectivity descriptor has been used to study a broader range of PtM surface alloys at low and high M coverages, including metals from groups 715.283 The Pt3M/Pt(111) alloy surface was created by replacing one surface Pt atom with alloying element M, giving 1/4 ML surface coverage for M. There were two types of 3-fold hollow sites, namely Pt3 and Pt2M sites on Pt3M/Pt(111) surfaces. A PtM/Pt(111) surface was created by replacing two surface Pt atoms with M, giving 1/2 ML surface coverage for M. On the PtM/Pt(111) surface, the 3-fold Pt3 sites were removed, and 3-fold binding sites included Pt2M and PtM2 sites. 27 elements (M) were selected for this study, which comprised the TMs from groups 711 and the post-transition (P-T) metals from groups 1215. The P-T metals included Zn, Cd, Hg, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, and Bi. The TMs were further classified as nonpreferred transition (NT) metals and carbon-preferred transition (CT) metals based on the preferred binding site of a carbon atom (Fig. 22a). NT metals were transition metals where a carbon atom placed on Pt3M/Pt(111) preferred to bind on Pt3 sites. Conversely, the transition metals where C preferred to bind on Pt2M sites over Pt3M/Pt(111) were labeled CT metals. The NT metals included Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, (Pt), Cu, Ag, and Au. The CT metals included Tc, Re, Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir. On PT and NT alloys, C, H, and CH preferred to bind to Pt3 at 1/4 ML coverage and Pt2M at 1/2 ML coverage. CH3 preferred to bind to top sites of Pt at both coverages. On CT alloys, C, H, and CH preferred to bind to Pt2M at 1/4 ML coverage and PtM2 at 1/2 ML coverage. CH3 preferred to bind to top sites of the M atom at both coverages. The scaling relationship was established between the desorption energy of ethylene and methyl binding energy (BECH3) (Fig. 22b and c) as well as the activation energy of ethylene dehydrogenation and the methylidyne dehydrogenation reaction energy (ΔECH) plus the methyl binding energy (BECH3) (Fig. 22d) on various Pt3M alloys. It indicated that alloying Pt with Pb, Bi, Tl, Sn, Sb, Hg, and In decreased the ethylene desorption energy and increased the activation energy of CH activation of ethylene, thus resulting in higher ethylene selectivity.283 Fig. 22 (a) Binding site preferences of carbon atoms on three categories of alloying elements: post-transition (P-T) metals, nonpreferred transition (NT) metals, and carbon-preferred transition (CT) metals.

Cybulskis et al.290 investigated Zn promotion of platinum for ethane dehydrogenation by combining DFT, kinetic, and in situ spectroscopies. DFT calculations could accurately predict the electronic structure of Pt 5d valence orbitals in Pt/SiO2 and PtZn/SiO2. Zn lowers the energy of filled states of the Pt surface and weakens the binding energy between adsorbates and the Pt surface as well as increases the turnover rate of the reaction. In addition, Zn has a geometric effect, leading to the formation of a Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy with uniformly isolated Pt surface sites, which effectively suppresses hydrogenolysis and cracking reactions.Ko et al.291 investigated the influence of P doping into Ni-based catalysts on ethane dehydrogenation by combined DFT and experimental study. DFT calculations revealed that a Ni2P(001) surface exhibited a similar CH3CH2H activation barrier to, but a much greater CH2CHH activation barrier (an indicator of the coking tendency) than a Ni(111) surface. Meanwhile, the experimental study demonstrated a much higher ethylene selectivity (<80%) and less carbon deposition on the Ni2P(2)/SBA-15 catalyst compared to Ni/SBA-15 (<1% ethylene selectivity). This highlights the potential of using metal phosphides as robust and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.Ge is another promising promoter. It can enhance the catalyst selectivity without decreasing the catalytic activity. DFT calculations were performed on MgO-supported Pt3 and Pt7 with Pt2Ge and Pt7Ge clusters.278 It was found the Pt2Ge could elongate the CH bond more than Pt and had a lower activation barrier of 0.05 eV compared to 0.17 eV for pure Pt. Therefore, the activity of ethane dehydrogenation was not negatively affected by Ge. On the other hand, Ge quenched the unpaired electrons in the metal clusters, which were needed to activate alkenes for dehydrogenation. Ge in alloys made Pt interact less strongly with ethylene and therefore increased ethylene selectivity. For the smallest cluster size, the C binding energy was significantly reduced and increased catalyst resistance to deactivation due to coking.
3.1.3 Effect of Pt and Pt alloy particle size Pt and PtSn alloy particle size effects were studied experimentally on ethane dehydrogenation by Bell and co-workers.292 It was found that the ethane TOF increased monotonically with increasing particle size in the range of 1.58.5 nm, whereas the ethylene selectivity remained constant across all particle sizes. Their result suggested that ethane dehydrogenation was favored over flatter surfaces on large particles. The authors attributed the high TOF on large particles to the favored desorption of ethylene due to the lower binding energy of ethylene on terrace sites. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions have been studied on Pt(111) and Pt(211) with DFT calculations.279 On the Pt(211) surface, CH2CH2* and CH3CH* can be generated very rapidly from ethane with low activation barriers (Table 1). However, the stronger CH2CH2* adsorption energy on Pt(211) makes the desorption of ethylene more difficult compared to Pt(111). On Pt(111), CH3CH* can be dehydrogenated rapidly to form CH3C*. The CC bond cleavage takes place most possibly via CH3CH2, CH3CH, and CHCH. More quantitative data on reaction pathways require detailed microkinetic modeling. More recent work showed that under-coordinated step edge sites bonded C2Hx and CHx species more strongly than terrace sites.280 These under-coordinated step edge sites promote deep dehydrogenation, resulting in coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina on Pt step edge sites significantly suppresses unselective deep dehydrogenation and coke formation (Table 1). The experiment of decorating Pt with ALD of alumina results in a 4-fold increase in the TOF of ethylene formation.
Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation.292
3.2 Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
Oxidative dehydrogenation, which couples the endothermic dehydration of ethane with the strongly exothermic oxidation of hydrogen, exhibits higher ethane conversion and lower operation temperature compared to steam cracking, which leads to growing interest in this process. However, major practical challenges with ODH reaction still occur, which are (1) additional safety measures associated with O2 in the feed and (2) the development of highly active and selective catalysts due to the high reactivity of olefins compared with the corresponding paraffins.265 The ODH of ethane has not been practiced on a large scale yet. The relatively higher reactivity of olefins is attributed to the direct interaction of the olefin with catalytic surfaces. Typical undesired side reaction involves total oxidation to form CO, CO2, and water. The reaction occurs through oxygen insertion into the CH bond or from the addition of oxygen to olefins.
The only feedstock that can achieve high selectivity to olefins is ethane because ethylene is sufficiently unreactive towards oxygen compared to ethane. This is evidenced by the bonding strength difference in paraffins and olefins. The weakest CH bond in ethane has a bond energy of 4.35 eV, whereas the weakest CH bond in ethylene has an energy of 4.60 eV. For propane and propylene, the weakest CH bond has a bond energy of 4.16 and 3.74 eV respectively. A more significant difference exists for CC bond energy; the weakest CC bond in ethylene is a double bond with a bond energy of 7.46 eV compared to 4.29 eV in propylene, in which the weakest CC bond is a single bond. In general, to achieve high selectivity, the weakest CH or CC bond in the olefin has to be less than 0.31 eV weaker than the weakest CH bond in the reacting paraffin.293 This is true for ethane and ethylene, but not for propane and propylene.
3.2.1 Reaction mechanism with oxygen as an oxidant on metal oxides According to the analysis at the molecular level, the ODH of ethane with O2 as an oxidant takes place by the way that dissociated O species that originated from gas-phase O2 reacts with H species dissociated from ethane on the surface to form H2O and ethylene, as shown below.294
CnH2n+2 + 1/2O2  CnH2n + H2O (8) ODH normally accompanies the combustion of hydrocarbons, producing CO and CO2. To avoid over-oxidation of hydrocarbons, lattice oxygen in metal oxides can be used as the alternative oxygen supplier for the ODH process, which is often called a chemical looping ODH process. Most of the catalysts that are active for the ODH of ethane fall into redox-active metal oxides such as V2O5,295 MoO3,294 MoVTeNb mixed metal oxides,296 Co oxides,297 Ni oxides,298 and IrO2.299 There is a general consensus that ODH of ethane on such materials follows a MVK221 mechanism and the reactivity of oxygen plays a vital role in the CH activation of ethane. That is, the lattice oxygen of metal oxides interacts with hydrocarbons to form oxygen vacancies (eqn (9)), followed by the regeneration process (eqn (10)).
CnH2n+2 + MxOy  CnH2n + MxOy1 + H2O (9) MxPy1 + 1/2O2  MxOy (10) V2O5 catalysts The most prominent redox metal oxides for ethane ODH are supported V2O5 catalysts. The oxide support does not participate in the reaction, but it does influence the reactivity and stability of the oxygen bonded to V.300 Three types of metaloxygen bond have been identified in the surface vanadium species as illustrated in Fig. 23, including terminal VO bonds, bridging O atoms between V and the support (VOS), and bridging O atoms between two V cations (VOV).301 The isolated VO4 species on the support contains the first two types of VO bonds, while the polymeric VO4 species contains all three VO bonds.
