1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue. To improve the robustness against coking, additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, can be added. These promoters can increase the selectivity towards propylene and reduce the formation of coke, thus enhancing the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

1.在工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种从丙烷生产丙烯的替代过程来应对这些挑战。PDH是一种吸热反应，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性，在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中开发创新的催化剂设计策略至关重要。目前，最常用的商业PDH催化剂包括负载的Pt或CrOx。尽管负载的Pt催化剂表现出高活性，但由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活仍然是一个挑战性问题。为了提高抗焦炭性能，可以添加额外的助剂，如晚期过渡金属、主族金属(包括Sn和Ga)、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。这些助剂可以提高对丙烯的选择性，减少焦炭的形成，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和可回收性。

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing. PDH processes, particularly non-oxidative PDH, have gained attention due to their potential to increase propylene yield and reduce energy consumption compared to traditional methods like steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies.

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant and cheap. PDH techniques, especially non-oxidative PDH, can achieve high propylene yields with good selectivity. However, the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation remains a significant issue. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of single atom catalysts and alloy surfaces, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues. Single atom catalysts, which maximize the efficiency of metal utilization, can suppress deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, increasing selectivity towards propylene. Alloy surfaces, by modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst, can also enhance stability and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative process to produce propylene. PDH processes, particularly non-oxidative PDH, can convert propane directly into propylene without the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons, which is more energy-intensive and less selective. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported metal catalysts, such as Pt or Cr-based catalysts, which are tailored to have high activity and selectivity for PDH while minimizing coke formation. Additionally, the development of single-atom catalysts and alloy catalysts can improve the efficiency and longevity of PDH catalysts by maximizing the utilization of active metal sites and reducing the tendency for deep dehydrogenation and coking. Furthermore, the optimization of catalyst morphology, such as the use of nanoparticles or specific crystal facets, can also enhance the catalytic performance and recyclability of PDH catalysts.
