1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative process to produce propylene. PDH processes, particularly non-oxidative PDH, can convert propane directly into propylene without the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons, which is more energy-intensive and less selective. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported metal catalysts, such as Pt or Cr-based catalysts, which are tailored to have high activity and selectivity for PDH while minimizing coke formation. Additionally, the development of single-atom catalysts and alloy catalysts can improve the efficiency and longevity of PDH catalysts by maximizing the utilization of active metal sites and reducing the tendency for deep dehydrogenation and coking. Furthermore, the optimization of catalyst morphology, such as the use of nanoparticles or specific crystal facets, can also enhance the catalytic performance and recyclability of PDH catalysts.

1.在工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种替代工艺来生产丙烯，以应对这些挑战。PDH工艺，尤其是非氧化PDH，可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需裂解更重的烃类，后者能耗更高且选择性较低。为了克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。这些策略包括使用金属催化剂，如Pt或Cr基催化剂，这些催化剂经过调整，具有高活性和选择性，用于PDH，同时最小化焦炭的形成。此外，开发单原子催化剂和合金催化剂可以提高PDH催化剂的效率和寿命，通过最大化活性金属位点的利用并减少深度脱氢和结焦的倾向。此外，优化催化剂形态，如使用纳米颗粒或特定的晶体面，也可以增强PDH催化剂的催化性能和可回收性。
