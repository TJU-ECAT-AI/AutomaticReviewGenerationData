1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant and cheap. PDH techniques, especially non-oxidative PDH, can achieve high propylene yields with good selectivity. However, the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation remains a significant issue. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of single atom catalysts and alloy surfaces, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues. Single atom catalysts, which maximize the efficiency of metal utilization, can suppress deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, increasing selectivity towards propylene. Alloy surfaces, by modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst, can also enhance stability and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

1.在工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供从丰富且廉价的丙烷生产丙烯的替代过程来应对这些挑战，特别是非氧化PDH技术，可以实现高丙烯产率和良好的选择性。然而，催化剂因焦炭形成而失活仍然是一个重大问题。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，如使用单原子催化剂和合金表面，以克服失活问题。单原子催化剂通过最大化金属利用效率，可以抑制深度脱氢和焦炭形成，提高丙烯的选择性。合金表面通过改变催化剂的电子结构，也可以在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中增强稳定性并提高可回收性。
