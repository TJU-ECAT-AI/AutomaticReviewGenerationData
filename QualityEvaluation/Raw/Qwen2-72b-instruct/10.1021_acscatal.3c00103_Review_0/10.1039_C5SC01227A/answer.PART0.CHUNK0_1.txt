1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing. PDH processes, particularly non-oxidative PDH, have gained attention due to their potential to increase propylene yield and reduce energy consumption compared to traditional methods like steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies.
