[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
[5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
[6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
[8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
[9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
[10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."

[12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
[13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
[14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
[15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
[16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
[17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
[19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."

[22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising and effective route to produce propylene. PDH has been exploited in industry, but there is still room for improvement in Pt catalysts, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines catalytic performance and stability. To reduce coke formation and enhance stability, various methods have been proposed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen, alloying Pt with second metals such as Sn, modifying supports, controlling the size of the Pt catalyst, and exploring single atom Pt catalysts. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism and the complex reaction network of PDH. Despite previous reviews on light alkane activation, there is a lack of in-depth analysis on coke formation, and this review aims to provide a comprehensive account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, including its origin, nature, kinetics, and methods to inhibit coke. The review also discusses catalyst regeneration and future improvements for the stability of metal catalysts in the catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的大幅增加以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术作为一种有前景且有效的大量生产丙烯的途径应运而生。PDH已经在工业中得到应用，但在Pt催化剂方面仍有改进空间，尤其是需要解决反应中焦炭形成的问题，这严重削弱了催化性能和稳定性。为了减少焦炭形成并提高稳定性，提出了多种方法，包括与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将Pt与Sn等第二金属合金化，修改载体，控制Pt催化剂的尺寸，以及探索单原子Pt催化剂。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟为PDH的失活机制和复杂的反应网络提供了见解。尽管之前有关于轻烷烃活化的综述，但在焦炭形成方面缺乏深入分析，而本综述旨在从文献全面调查的角度，提供关于Pt催化剂上焦炭形成的综合描述，包括焦炭的起源、性质、动力学以及抑制焦炭的方法。综述还讨论了催化剂再生和金属催化剂在短链烷烃催化转化中稳定性的未来改进。
