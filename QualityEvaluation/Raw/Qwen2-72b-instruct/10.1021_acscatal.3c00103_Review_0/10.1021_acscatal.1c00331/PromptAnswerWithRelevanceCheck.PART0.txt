1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. However, the issue of coke formation during the reaction severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of Pt catalysts, necessitating the development of innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues. These strategies include the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen, alloying Pt with second metals such as Sn, modifying supports, controlling the size of the Pt catalyst, and exploring single atom Pt catalysts. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism and the complex reaction network of PDH, leading to the proposal of descriptors between the barrier of CH bond activation and propylene desorption. These advancements aim to enhance stability and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts.

Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.
