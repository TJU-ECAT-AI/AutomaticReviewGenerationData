[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
[5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
[6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
[8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
[9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
[10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
[11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
[12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
[13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
[14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
[15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
[16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
[17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
[19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
[20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
[21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
[22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. However, the issue of coke formation during the reaction severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of Pt catalysts, necessitating the development of innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues. These strategies include the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen, alloying Pt with second metals such as Sn, modifying supports, controlling the size of the Pt catalyst, and exploring single atom Pt catalysts. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism and the complex reaction network of PDH, leading to the proposal of descriptors between the barrier of CH bond activation and propylene desorption. These advancements aim to enhance stability and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的大幅增加以及传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是大规模生产丙烯最有前景和最有效的途径之一。然而，反应过程中产生的焦炭严重削弱了Pt催化剂的催化性能和稳定性，这促使了创新催化剂设计策略的开发，以克服失活问题。这些策略包括共喂入还原气体如氢气、将Pt与Sn等第二金属合金化、修改载体、控制Pt催化剂的尺寸以及探索单原子Pt催化剂。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟为PDH的失活机制和复杂的反应网络提供了见解，提出了CH键活化和丙烯脱附之间的势垒的描述符。这些进展旨在提高稳定性和改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性。
