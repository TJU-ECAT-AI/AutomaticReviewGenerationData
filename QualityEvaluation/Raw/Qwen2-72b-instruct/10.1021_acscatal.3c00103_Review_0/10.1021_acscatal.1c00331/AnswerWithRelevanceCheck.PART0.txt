          [1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."

          Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

          随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的发展被视为大规模生产丙烯最有希望和最有效的途径之一。PDH已经在工业中成功实施，但仍有改进空间，特别是针对铂（Pt）催化剂在反应中形成的焦炭问题，这严重削弱了催化性能和稳定性。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，包括将还原气体如氢气与丙烷共喂入，以显著减少焦炭形成；将Pt与第二金属如锡（Sn）合金化，以获得额外的好处；修改载体以控制焦炭形成；调整Pt催化剂的尺寸，以影响反应性和副反应；探索单Pt原子催化剂，揭示在尺寸极限下的不同机制。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟在理解失活机制和绘制PDH复杂反应网络方面也发挥了关键作用。这些策略旨在改善催化剂在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性，以应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。
