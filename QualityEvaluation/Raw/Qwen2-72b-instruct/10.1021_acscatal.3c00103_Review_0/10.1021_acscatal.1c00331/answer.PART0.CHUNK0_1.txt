[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[4] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
[5] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."
[6] "The most straightforward method to curb coke is to modify the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst."
[7] "The introduction of Sn could cause the transfer of coke from active site to support."
[8] "A more thorough kinetic model was investigated by Li et al."
[9] "Recently, Cormas group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH."
[10] "Although the prevention of coke formation achieved impressive progress, the coke deposition is still unavoidable in PDH. Thus, it is mandatory to periodically regenerate the catalyst in industry."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a promising and effective route to produce propylene on a large scale. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as modifying the structure and composition of the Pt catalyst, introducing elements like Sn to transfer coke from the active site to the support, and developing more thorough kinetic models, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The periodic regeneration of the catalyst is mandatory in industry to deal with the unavoidable coke deposition.
