[2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
[5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
[6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[20] "The main method to regenerate the coke-covered catalyst is to burn coke with oxidant."
[21] "Although the prevention of coke formation achieved impressive progress, the coke deposition is still unavoidable in PDH."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a promising and effective route to produce propylene on a large scale. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of Pt-based catalysts with added promoters like Sn, Cu, and Zn, which can help to curb coke formation. Support engineering, such as the modification of the nature of the support, is also being explored to improve coke resistance. The size of the Pt catalyst is a significant factor, with small-sized Pt particles and single Pt atom catalysts showing potential for reducing coke formation. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) are providing insights into the deactivation mechanism, and the development of confined Pt clusters in zeolites is showing promise for enhanced stability and resistance to coking. Regeneration techniques, such as burning coke with oxidants and further oxychlorination, are being used to maintain the high dispersion of Pt and prolong the life of the catalyst.
