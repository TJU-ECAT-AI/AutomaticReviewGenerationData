[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
[3] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
[4] "In the next section, we provide brief descriptions about the nature of the active sites for the two catalyst types."
[5] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
[6] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
[7] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2 . The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[8] "However, the promoted Pt catalyst reportedly suffered from a short half-life due to the volatility of the active phase of the catalyst in the reaction condition."
[9] "The catalyst is produced by soft landing of Pt810 clusters on porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO, Anopore) membranes coated with alumina (Al2O3/AAO) by atomic layer deposition (ALD)."
[10] "In order to meet the requirements listed above, supported oxides of p-block metals have been evaluated for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode."
[11] "In general, doped ceria is found to be more selective to hydrogen combustion than undoped ceria."
[12] "The efficiency of this approach depends on the membrane type and geometry [114] ,[115] ,[116] ."
[13] "The membrane should have sufficiently high oxygen flux at the dehydrogenation temperature and the geometry should afford high surface area."
[14] "Alkenes, hydrogen and electrical energy can be obtained from dehydrogenation of alkanes in a proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactor when run without an oxygen feed."
[15] "This cogeneration mode has been reported for dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene [122] ,[123] ,[124] ."
[16] "This reaction mode is less appropriate for propane dehydrogenation because propene selectivity is more sensitive to reaction temperature than ethene selectivity."
[17] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
[18] "Propene yields from supported vanadium catalysts are generally lower than those of VMgO systems."
[19] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."
[20] "Supported molybdenum catalysts follow the same trend as supported vanadium; they are characterized by higher propene selectivity but lower yield than vanadium counterparts due to their lower activity."
[21] "The turnover rates in the ODH of propane correlate with reducibility of ZrO2 supported VOx, MoOx, NbOx and WOx catalysts."
[22] "However, there remains the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over the VOx (groups V and VI transition metal oxides)."
[23] "This suggests weak surface adsorption of alkane on the catalyst(s), or that the alkane reacts from the gas phase via the EleyRideal mechanism."
[24] "Using kinetic isotopic studies, Iglesia et al."
[25] "One suggested explanation for the increase in k3 with increasing propane conversion, is that the allylic CH bond in propene is weaker than the methylene CH bond in propane."
[26] "The heats of adsorption of alkenes on acidic sites are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes."
[27] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali ions has been shown to increase propene selectivity but at the expense of a decrease in propane conversion due to lower reducibility of the VOx or MoOx domain [143] ,[144] ."
[28] "The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity."
[29] "The V3 + species was therefore considered either short-lived or non-existent during ODH of propane."
[30] "The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction."
[31] "Although the CH activation over VOx discussed thus far has V = O at its center, there are reports that contest whether V = O is the source of the active oxygen for CH activation and other catalytic reactions of supported MOx catalysts."
[32] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity."
[33] "The unprecedented selectivity of the VOx/MgAlO may be attributed to the heterolytic CH activation pathway, the reduction of V5 + to V3 + and the weak surface acidity of the catalyst."
[34] "Water is a by-product in ODH, and in the presence of water the Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides regenerate and restore the favorable conditions for the V3 +/V5 + redox cycle."
[35] "The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes."
[36] "Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [169] , there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the CH activation step."
[37] "Since electron-deficient late transition metal cations are electrophilic, direct participation of the Ni-center via electrophilic metalation cannot be ruled out."
[38] "The lower selectivity with propane may be attributable to a higher propensity of propene for side reactions on acid sites of the catalyst surface."
[39] "The reaction conditions are similar for propane and ethane, and the difference in reaction rate may be attributable to reaction compatibility of the CH of the alkanes to the active oxygen species."
[40] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."
[41] "The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical."
[42] "Product selectivity is thus largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry."
[43] "Alkene selectivity increases with decreasing Lewis acidity of the metal ions ( Table 5 , entries 1, 7b & 7d vs. entries 2, 3, 4, 5, 7a & 7c)."
[44] "Based on the heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism, after activation of alkane on the catalyst surface, propagation steps take place in the gas phase."
[45] "Increasing surface Lewis acidity increases the tendency of re-adsorption of alkenes and unwanted reactions on the catalyst."
[46] "The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts."
[47] "VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity."
[48] "Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms."
[49] "Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts."
[50] "Thus CH activation on heterogeneous catalysts can be a continuum from an electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, depending on the metal center and the surface oxygen species of ligands."
[51] "Insights from the homogeneous catalyst systems can provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts."
[52] "Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 have been implicated to contain sites that mimic the active sites of these enzymes [188] ,[189] ,[190] ,[191] ,[192] ."
[53] "The enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide insight into the performance of the CuAl catalyst reported by Rotenberg and co-workers [71] ."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.
