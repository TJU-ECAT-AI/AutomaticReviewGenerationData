[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
[3] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
[4] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
[5] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
[6] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
[7] "The two catalyst types produce different by-products and require different regeneration treatments."
[8] "Moreover, factors responsible for irreversible deactivation of each catalyst type differ."
[9] "In the next section, we provide brief descriptions about the nature of the active sites for the two catalyst types."
[10] "The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric."
[11] "The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of second hydrogen from platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule."
[12] "The dissociative adsorption of the alkane substrate involves two platinum atoms and it is the rate-limiting step."
[13] "The step is irreversible but the remaining steps are reversible."
[14] "Activation of the catalyst is usually carried out in situ using an alkane feed."
[15] "It is generally agreed that the active sites of the catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3 + or Cr2 + species."
[16] "These Cr species are responsible for activation of the CH bond of the alkane substrate."
[17] "The CH cleavage is assisted by surface oxygen species."
[18] "The alkane dissociates into an alkyl group bonded to the Cr species and a hydrogen atom bonded to surface oxygen species."
[19] "To improve the catalyst, understanding whether the oxygen species are ligands of the active cations, are from the active cation-support interface, or are from the support is necessary."
[20] "In summary, the first and rate-limiting step of alkane dehydrogenation using platinum or chromium oxide-based catalysts involves CH activation."
[21] "Although a number of efforts have been made to gain insight on the mechanism of the reaction, questions still remain, especially regarding the pathway of the CH activation."
[22] "It is of fundamental and applied interest to know whether the first CH bond cleavage is homolytic or heterolytic."
[23] "If it is a heterolytic pathway, it will further be of interest to know whether the first hydrogen from the alkane substrate is abstracted as a proton or as a hydride ion."
[24] "This knowledge will benefit catalyst improvement efforts."
[25] "The simple impregnation techniques for preparing supported (especially alumina) metal and oxide catalysts becloud their structural heterogeneity."
[26] "This structural heterogeneity makes the properties-performance correlation of the catalysts complicated."
[27] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."
[28] "In the next section, we examine adsorption and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on microporous zeolite-based catalysts."
[29] "Light alkanes are adsorbed on zeolites via dispersive interaction."
[30] "Protons and the exchanged metals ions are typically the active sites in zeolites, while the zeolite framework plays the role of anchor for the active sites and/or dispersion medium for the reactants."
[31] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[32] "In addition, the nature and the density of the active sites influence the framework dispersion forces."
[33] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[34] "This agrees with Hashiguchi et al. [26] , who found enhanced activation of the CH bond on a homogeneous catalyst."
[35] "Wender et al. [27] showed that 3040% of heat adsorption in n-alkanes on Na-zeolite is due to polarization of the adsorbates."
[36] "Subbotina et al. [28] also demonstrated that the CH bond of ethane is more strongly polarized on Mg2 + and Ca2 + forms of Y zeolite than on Na+ forms."
[37] "Mg2 +-Y zeolite molecules exhibit weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane than Ca2 +-zeolites."
[38] "Based on charge density considerations, Mg2 + cations are expected to exhibit a stronger polarizing effect than Ca2 + cations."
[39] "Subbotina et al. explain that because of the smaller ionic radius of Mg2 +, it is more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice than a Ca2 + ion, thereby reducing the polarizing effect of Mg2 + on the hydrocarbon adsorbate."
[40] "Sievers et al. [29] ,[30] also report that the La3 + form of X zeolite induces strong polarization of adsorbed alkane molecules; partial positive charges were induced on secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of alkane molecules."
[41] "The authors suggest that the polarization may be viewed as an intermediate condition to hydride abstraction (which is an important elementary step in CH activation)."
[42] "They add that CH bond polarization was enhanced by physisorbed water molecules that coordinate with La3 + cations."
[43] "The enhanced polarization of CH bonds by the presence of water molecules on La3 +X zeolite may have a beneficial effect in oxidative dehydrogenation where water is a by-product."
[44] "Alkane polarization studies on Na+, Mg2 +, Ca2 +, and La3 + exchanged X-zeolites indicate that the polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[45] "Note that these alkane polarizing cations occupy the same position on the zeolites as the well-known CH activation cations/metals, and thus the CH polarizing effect has a complementary effect on CH activation."
[46] "This may add to the number of relevant variables and increase the challenge of optimizing the ratio of activation/polarizing cations among exchangeable sites (Si/Al ratio), as well as the sequence for incorporating the cations or metals during catalyst preparation."
[47] "Further, it is important to note that the choice of cations should be such that they exhibit no catalytic (oligomerization, isomerization, aromatisation or oxidation) effects on the target alkene products at the reaction condition."
[48] "Furthermore, it may be beneficial to create a CH polarization effect on the zeolite framework."
[49] "This can be achieved by appropriate chance of framework atoms."
[50] "Since active sites are usually created on the zeolite frameworks."
[51] "The activation of CH bonds of light alkanes occurs readily on super electrophiles (super Brnsted and super Lewis acid) at low temperatures [31] ,[32] ,[33] ."
[52] "Although CH activation on zeolites have been observed at low temperatures [34] ,[35] , industrial alkane reactions on zeolites are usually carried out at high temperatures."
[53] "Several experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular dynamics of light alkanes on zeolite have been published [36] ,[37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] ."
[54] "However, despite the decades of intensive investigations on the subject, the actual mechanism of CH activation on acid zeolite is still debated."
[55] "Two CH activation paths are generally recognized: the unimolecular/protolytic mechanism and the bimolecular/carbenium chain mechanism [42] ."
[56] "The unimolecular mechanism involves direct protonation of an alkane-forming carbonium ion intermediate."
[57] "The proton can be inserted into either a CC or CH bond of the alkane."
[58] "Proton insertion through the CC bond leads to cracking of the alkane, with the acid site regenerated."
[59] "Insertion through the HC bond yields H2 and a carbenium ion/alkoxide intermediate."
[60] "Desorption of alkene from the intermediate regenerates the acid, or the alkoxide can enter the bimolecular conversion path."
[61] "For example, activation of propane on acid zeolite based on the two mechanisms is illustrated in Scheme 1 ."
[62] "Low reactant partial pressure and high temperature favor unimolecular dehydrogenation of alkane on acid zeolite."
[63] "These conditions favor the endothermic desorption step (rate limiting step) leading to propene."
[64] "In contrast, high partial pressure and low temperature favor the bimolecular mechanism leading to a low propene yield."
[65] "The two molecular mechanisms devoid of side reactions give fairly predictable product distribution."
[66] "However, the products of each route are prone to side reactions (dimerization, oligomerization, isomerization & aromatisation) in the presence of Bronsted acid sites."
[67] "Hence propene selectivity on acidic zeolite is very low and products rich in aromatics are usually obtained [43] ."
[68] "The active sites (alkoxide intermediate) of the bimolecular pathway are formed in situ ( Scheme 1 )."
[69] "The alkoxide intermediate is made up of an alkyl carbenium ion ionically held to the zeolite framework oxygen ion."
[70] "The active sites of the unimolecular pathway are the charge balancing protons of the zeolite framework."
[71] "A proton and a carbenium ion are an electrophilic or Lewis acid species (a proton can also be considered as a special case of Lewis acidity)."
[72] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[73] "The electrophiles (proton and carbenium ion) activate CH at high temperatures (500 C), giving low conversion rates of light alkanes and poor selectivity to corresponding alkenes."
[74] "Iglesia and co-workers [43] ,[44] ,[45] ,[46] used isotopic labeling studies to demonstrate that CH activation is not the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenation of propane on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5."
[75] "They proposed that the CH bond cleavage produces an H-adatom and an alkoxide intermediate."
[76] "Desorption of an alkene from the alkoxide regenerates the proton sites on the zeolites."
[77] "An alkoxide intermediate may also discharge as a hydrogen rich species through cracking."
[78] "Iglesia et al. proposed that desorption or disposal of the H-adatom from the CH bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step."
[79] "A similar deduction was reached by Yu et al."
[80] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
[81] "The specific role of the exchanged metals has been the subject of several reports with special attention on Ga and Zn."
[82] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity [48] and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."
[83] "Similar synergistic effects have been reported for Zn/H-MFI and Co/H-MFI [49] ,[50] ,[51] ."
[84] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
[85] "Iglesia and Biscardi [49] hypothesized that the monomeric species enhance propane conversion by promoting re-combinative desorption (RD) of the H-adatom formed from the CH cleavage."
[86] "It is worthwhile noting that the exchange cations (electrophilic species) constitute the CH activation sites [52] ."
[87] "Hence, more insights are required about their additional role in promoting RD."
[88] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
[89] "In the next section, we examine the mechanism of desorption of H-adatoms over Ga and Zn exchanged H-ZSM-5."
[90] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[91] "Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."
[92] "According to Kanansky et al."
[93] "Zn and Ga are introduced on H-ZSM-5 through a vapor deposition technique using Zn metal vapor and Ga(CH3)3 as the source of Zn and Ga, respectively."
[94] "The metal introduction technique allows quantitative exchange of the zeolite protons which leads to Zn/Al = 0.5 and Ga/Al = 1, respectively."
[95] "Zn2 + is generated directly, but Ga+ is produced by H2 treatment at 500 C to release the methyl groups."
[96] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[97] "The mechanism of CH activation with ethane by the two sites under the same reaction conditions are summarized in Scheme 2 ."
[98] "The proposed mechanism is in agreement with the mechanism suggested from calculations using the GAUSSIAN 94 program for ethane activation on Zn-exchanged zeolite by Frash and van Santen [54] ."
[99] "In another theoretical study using a DFT cluster modeling approach, Pidko and van Santen [55] compared the activation energy of CH with three types of Zn species at active sites: OZn2+O, OZn+OZn+O and HOZn+ O."
[100] "The authors suggest that the reaction proceeds most easily on OZn2+O, and hypothesize that the enhanced Lewis activity of OZn2+O facilitates CH heterolytic cleavage."
[101] "They further argue that the first proton abstraction occurs preferentially on the oxygen sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located."
[102] "They proposed a one-step reaction to yield H2 and C2H4 from the decomposition of the Zn-alkyl and proton."
[103] "A proposed mechanism of CH activation on OGa+ has similarly been suggested using theoretical calculations [56] ."
[104] "High alkene selectivities are obtained on the H-ZSM-5 when exchangeable protons are rigorously replaced by Zn and Ga."
[105] "The Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 had higher ethane conversion rates but lower ethene selectivity than its Ga counterpart [53] ."
[106] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[107] "This is accompanied by conversion of the Lewis base site to a conjugate Bronsted acid site."
[108] "The OGa+ site, however, activates the CH bond via oxidative addition without a protonic site intermediate [57] ."
[109] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[110] "The elementary steps of CH activation on OGa+ ( Scheme 2 ) reveal that a redox cycle at the metal center is required for catalytic CH activation via the oxidative addition mechanism."
[111] "A redox cycle is not apparent in the elementary step presented for CH activation on OZn2+O."
[112] "Hence, a redox cycle is not a requisite for CH activation via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[113] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process ( Scheme 3 ) [58] ."
[114] "This redox process increases the availability of undesired protonic site intermediates."
[115] "Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 prepared by conventional ion-exchange methods contain a significant percentage of unexchanged proton sites leading to lower alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[116] "Iglesia and Biscardi [59] titrate the proton sites with NaOH."
[117] "The un-titrated and the titrated catalysts are denoted as Zn/H-ZSMS-5 and Zn/Na-ZSMS-5, respectively."
[118] "Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has four times the propane conversion rate and a higher propene selectivity than Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[119] "The propene formation rate obtained with Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was ten times that of Zn/H-ZSMS-5."
[120] "The zinc species at the cation exchange site of the zeolite was identified as OZn+OH."
[121] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[122] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[123] "Another strategy to enhance alkene selectivity is by controlling the strength of the proton sites."
[124] "The acidity of the sites depends on the nature of the trivalent cation of the zeolite framework."
[125] "Proton sites in borosilicate zeolites are weaker than those of aluminosilicate [60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] , and thus higher alkene selectivity is expected for alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H[Al]-ZSM-5."
[126] "However, Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 shows no activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[127] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[128] "This reduced basicity of the oxygen atoms is not sufficiently polarizing to complement the exchanged Zn2 + in CH bond cleavage."
[129] "In the next section, we examine use of zeolite support to design a Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[130] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."
[131] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions [65] ."
[132] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[133] "However, rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge even when using a Pt-based catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[134] "Waku et al."
[135] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."
[136] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[137] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3 + as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3 + led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."
[138] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[139] "In another report, Xuebing and Iglesia [67] demonstrated the ability of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate alkanes longer than C4; n-pentane and n-heptane were selectively converted to n-pentene and n-heptene, respectively."
[140] "Alkene selectivity was also improved when the residual proton generated during Pt exchange or Na-[Fe]-ZSM was titrated with Cs [67] ."
[141] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[142] "The presence of acid (Bronsted and Lewis) sites on the supports promotes readsorption, oligomerization and aromatisation of alkenes."
[143] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[144] "However, recent reports by Bell et al. [68] ,[69] ,[70] show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[145] "2.2.6. Overview of the mechanisms of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes using commercial catalysts"
[146] "At this stage, we can conclude that differences in the performance of Zn and Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 obtained by Kanansky et al."
[147] "are attributable to their respective CH activation mechanisms."
[148] "In addition, the role of exchanged Zn and Ga as promoters of RD becomes evident from the mechanisms ( Scheme 2 )."
[149] "The RD mechanism on Ga exchanged H-ZSM-5 is by reductive elimination of a hydrogen molecule from O[Ga(H)2]+ intermediate."
[150] "Decomposition of ZnR and a protonic site, or neutralization of the proton sites by ZnH, leads to desorption of the hydrogen molecule on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5."
[151] "By extrapolation, the mechanisms of CH activation on exchanged Zn and Ga H-ZSM-5 can described the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts respectively."
[152] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
[153] "However, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism could also explain the proposed CH activation on Cr-based catalysts."
[154] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
[155] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
[156] "The highlights in this section are presented in Table 2 ."
[157] "The table reveals the insights achieved on the reaction mechanism, alkene selectivity and catalyst stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[158] "Nonetheless, the level of catalyst activity is still far from acceptable, even at high temperature."
[159] "A recent report by Rothenberg et al."
[160] "Their report indicates that a porous copperaluminum framework material (stabilized by metal oxide) has better performance (activity/selectivity/stability) for propane dehydrogenation than a PtSn/Al2O3."
[161] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
[162] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
[163] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
[164] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
[165] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
[166] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes?
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route to produce propylene directly from propane. This process is particularly advantageous as it bypasses the need for steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which are the main technologies currently used for industrial production of ethene and propene. However, these traditional methods have limitations, including high energy consumption, complex processes, and the production of by-products that may not be desirable. PDH techniques, on the other hand, offer a more direct and potentially more energy-efficient method of producing propylene.
Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For instance, the use of zeolites as supports for platinum-based catalysts has been shown to enhance stability and recyclability by preventing the aggregation of platinum nanoparticles. Additionally, the incorporation of redox-active adatoms in a zeolite framework can enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism, which is critical for the performance of PDH catalysts.
In non-oxidative PDH, the focus is on improving the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used, and efforts are being made to optimize the electronic and geometric effects of promoters such as tin to enhance performance. The use of zeolites as supports can also improve the stability of the catalysts by preventing the formation of undesired acid sites that can lead to side reactions and deactivation.
In oxidative PDH, the challenge is to develop catalysts that can achieve high propene yields while minimizing the formation of by-products such as COx. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown promise in this regard, but the selectivity and stability of these catalysts can be improved by modifying the nature of the vanadium oxide phase and the support material. For example, the use of mesoporous supports can increase the space-time yield of propene, while the addition of alkali ions can increase propene selectivity at the cost of decreased activity.
Overall, the development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial for improving the performance of PDH processes and addressing the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何应对这些挑战，以及在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中，为克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发哪些创新的催化剂设计策略？
丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过直接从丙烷生产丙烯，应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。这一过程特别有利，因为它绕过了目前用于工业生产乙烯和丙烯的主要技术——蒸汽裂解或流化床催化裂化。然而，这些传统方法存在局限性，包括高能耗、复杂工艺以及可能产生不希望的副产品。相比之下，PDH技术提供了一种更直接、可能更节能的丙烯生产方法。
为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以应对氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的挑战。例如，使用沸石作为铂基催化剂的载体，已被证明可以增强稳定性和可回收性，防止铂纳米颗粒的聚集。此外，将具有氧化还原活性的吸附原子引入沸石框架中，可以通过Lewis碱辅助脱质子机制增强CH活化活性，这对PDH催化剂的性能至关重要。
在非氧化PDH中，重点是提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。通常使用铂基催化剂，正在努力优化锡等促进剂的电子和几何效应，以增强性能。使用沸石作为载体也可以通过防止形成导致副反应和失活的不希望的酸位点，提高催化剂的稳定性。
在氧化PDH中，挑战在于开发催化剂，以实现高丙烯产量，同时最小化COx等副产品的形成。基于钒的催化剂在这方面显示出前景，但通过修改钒氧化物相和载体材料的性质，可以提高这些催化剂的选择性和稳定性。例如，使用介孔载体可以增加丙烯的空间时间产量，而添加碱金属离子可以提高丙烯选择性，但以降低活性为代价。
总的来说，开发创新的催化剂设计策略对于提高PDH过程的性能，应对工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战至关重要。
