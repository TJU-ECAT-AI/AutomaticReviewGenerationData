[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
[3] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
[4] "In the next section, we provide brief descriptions about the nature of the active sites for the two catalyst types."
[5] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material."
[6] "The elementary steps involved in the dehydrogenation an alkane over a platinum catalyst are: dissociative adsorption of the alkane into an adsorbed hydrogen atom and alkyl group; elimination of second hydrogen from platinum atom bonded alkyl group; followed by desorption of the resulting alkene and recombination of the hydrogen atoms and desorption as a hydrogen molecule."
[7] "The CH cleavage is assisted by surface oxygen species."
[8] "To improve the catalyst, understanding whether the oxygen species are ligands of the active cations, are from the active cation-support interface, or are from the support is necessary."
[9] "The framework of microporous zeolites exerts dispersive forces on the reactant's molecules that depend on the shape, channel and cavity of the framework."
[10] "Recent reports have shown that the strong electrostatic field between protons or exchanged metal ions and basic oxygen species can enhance and/or induce polarization of bonds in hydrocarbon adsorbates."
[11] "The polarizing effect increases with increasing charge magnitude and ionic radius."
[12] "The two pathways essentially involve electrophilic CH activation."
[13] "The above proposition has been demonstrated on metal (e.g., Ga, Zn, and Co) exchanged zeolites."
[14] "Exchanged cations behave as monomeric species at the exchange sites of zeolite."
[15] "However, the authors did not provide further information on the nature of the H-adatoms and the mechanism of RD."
[16] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms."
[17] "The proposed active sites are OZn2+O and OGa+, respectively."
[18] "The CH activation on the OZn2+O site can be described by a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[19] "A protonic site intermediate increases tendency of side reactions on the Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 relative to the Ga counterpart."
[20] "However, under alkane dehydrogenation reaction conditions, the OZn2+O sites can undergo a reversible Zn2 +/Zn redox process."
[21] "The higher propene selectivity obtained on Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSMS-5 is presumably from the lower density and availability of proton sites on Zn/Na-ZSM-5."
[22] "The improved propane conversion rate of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5 is attributable to the higher efficiency of OZn+OH sites in catalyzing desorption of H-adatoms than OZn2+O sites."
[23] "The desired weaker acidity of the proton sites of Zn/H[B]-ZSM-5 requires weaker basicity of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework."
[24] "Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."
[25] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."
[26] "The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."
[27] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."
[28] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[29] "However, recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."
[30] "The electronic promotion effect of Sn is in line with the oxidative addition CH activation mechanism."
[31] "Now, the nature and the role of surface oxygen species become more evident."
[32] "The role of potassium in commercial Cr and Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is to minimize the undesired influence of protonic sites on alkene selectivity."
[33] "Of particular interest, is the suggestion that achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C may be possible."
[34] "Few details are known about the structure of the porous copperaluminum framework material."
[35] "However, copper is implicated as providing the active sites for the catalysis."
[36] "Also, that the material activated in oxygen gave higher propane conversion rates than those activated in inert gas atmosphere underscores the role of the surface oxide (oxygen species) in the catalysis."
[37] "Thus, the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism may be invoked here, and the redox property of the metal center is likely to play a role in achieving propane dehydrogenation at 350 C."
[38] "This should constitute the future research direction for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[39] "In this section, we examine the use of sacrificial fuel and selective hydrogen combustion in autothermal non-oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[40] "Catalyst design and reactor configuration are targeted at selective and efficient combustion of the sacrificial fuel to supply the heat required to ignite and sustain the gas phase endothermic dehydrogenation."
[41] "Recently, Cimino et al. were able to combine the robustness of LaMnO3 with the selective hydrogen oxidation of Pt to formulate Pt-LaMnO3 as a novel catalyst for ethene production via the catalytic partial oxidation of ethane with short contact time."
[42] "This catalyst is also reportedly being used for propene production via CPO of propane."
[43] "Selective hydrogen combustion and dehydrogenation can be accomplished with a single catalyst or a multi-catalyst system."
[44] "In a recent report, Vajda et al. showed that sub-nanometer platinum clusters display high propene yields in an oxygen co-fed propane dehydrogenation."
[45] "The catalyst showed turn over frequency (TOF) 40100 times higher than those reported for non-oxidative dehydrogenations."
[46] "This illustrates improved TOF in autothermal dehydrogenation (selective hydrogen combustion) over non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[47] "Removal of hydrogen from the catalyst surface via combustion increases the availability frequency of the active sites for the reaction catalytic cycle."
[48] "The performance of this catalyst can be explained in part by molecular theory of the structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions."
[49] "CH bond activation is categorized as a class II surface sensitivity, and catalytic reaction rate in this category increases with decreasing particle size of the active metal."
[50] "Alkene yield obtained by selective hydrogen removal using staged oxygen mode is about 1.6 times higher than without hydrogen removal."
[51] "Yu et al. exploit the promoting effect of Ce on the propane conversion and the inhibiting effect of Sn on COx formation to achieve a synergistic performance in Pt-Sn/Ce-Î³-Al2O3 catalyst."
[52] "The addition of a small amount of oxygen improved propene yield by 50% at 546 C."
[53] "In the conventional fixed bed reactor system, a solid oxygen carrier (SOC) is physically mixed with the dehydrogenation catalyst."
[54] "The key determinants of the suitability of a SOC are that it be inert to hydrocarbons but easily reduced by hydrogen at typical alkane dehydrogenation temperatures, and that it has a slower deactivation rate than the dehydrogenation catalyst."
[55] "Given its unique redox property (physical stability, high oxygen mobility) ceria (CeO2), has become a natural starting material for this application."
[56] "Although ceria is not selective for hydrogen oxidation, Graaf and co-workers demonstrated that its reduction behavior can be tuned toward selective hydrogen combustion by metal doping."
[57] "For example, a Bi-doped ceria is more selective to hydrogen combustion than the undoped ceria."
[58] "Other dopants investigated by the group include: Cu, W, Zr, Fe, Sn, Zn."
[59] "In general, doped ceria is found to be more selective to hydrogen combustion than undoped ceria."
[60] "Non-ceria materials are also being explored as solid oxygen carriers and selective hydrogen oxidation catalysts."
[61] "Au(35)wt/TiO2 catalysts exhibit acceptable selectively for hydrogen oxidation at 550 C when fed with H2O2 mixture."
[62] "Selectivity of the catalysts depends on the proportion of hydrogen to oxygen in the reactor; selectivity increases with an increasing hydrogen to oxygen ratio."
[63] "Perovskite oxide, La0.9Sr0.1MnO3, and PbCrO4 display higher catalytic performance for selective hydrogen combustion in simulated propane dehydrogenation feeds than metal-doped ceria catalysts."
[64] "The membrane or fuel cell reactor arrangement is based on reducing the risk of explosion in autothermal reactor systems."
[65] "The reactants mixture (oxygen, alkane, alkene and hydrogen) at the typical temperature of dehydrogenation (550 C) constitute an explosion risk."
[66] "But the likelihood of an explosion is lowered using a membrane or fuel cell reactor, since the alkane feed and oxygen supply to the active phases are deposited on the opposite sides of a membrane."
[67] "In addition to the requirements for a solid oxygen carrier listed in Section 3.2.2.1 , efficiency of the reaction depends on the ratio of ionic (proton or oxide ion) to electronic conductivity of the membrane."
[68] "Although in each case the dehydrogenation reaction equilibrium will be driven forward through removal/combustion of hydrogen, the membrane reactor mode has received more attention, because the hydrogen combustion takes place in the same partition of the reactor as the dehydrogenation."
[69] "The heat release is thus readily available to offset part of the energy input for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[70] "Compared to the use of SOC catalysts in fixed bed reactor systems that involve alternate cycles of reduction (hydrogen combustion) and regeneration (re-oxidation) , the membrane reactor mode is less tedious to operate."
[71] "Studies in this area have focused on oxide ion-conducting membrane."
[72] "The efficiency of this approach depends on the membrane type and geometry."
[73] "The membrane should have sufficiently high oxygen flux at the dehydrogenation temperature and the geometry should afford high surface area."
[74] "Generally reported membranes explored for dehydrogenation of alkane are perovskite oxides."
[75] "Apatite-type Ln-silicates, La9.33(SiO4)6O2, are also potential membrane material for dehydrogenation of alkanes."
[76] "In the fuel cell reactor mode, when the membrane is an oxide ion conductor, the reactor is essentially a hydrocarbon solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a dehydrogenation catalyst deposited on the anode instead of an oxidation catalyst."
[77] "SOFC for partial or total oxidation of hydrocarbons is an active area of interest for production of syngas and oxygenates."
[78] "However, few reports exist on dehydrogenation of alkanes in a fuel cell reactor with an oxide ion conductor."
[79] "Dehydrogenation of propane in a proton conducting fuel cell reactor has been investigated by Feng et al."
[80] "They carried out a reaction at 700 C using Y-doped BaCeO3 as a solid proton conductor, and a Pt catalyst anode."
[81] "An oxide ion membrane reactor could allow a lower reaction temperature and improve propene selectivity."
[82] "Alkenes, hydrogen and electrical energy can be obtained from dehydrogenation of alkanes in a proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactor when run without an oxygen feed."
[83] "This cogeneration mode has been reported for dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
[84] "This reaction mode is less appropriate for propane dehydrogenation because propene selectivity is more sensitive to reaction temperature than ethene selectivity."
[85] "And may account for why there is yet any similar report on propane dehydrogenation in cogeneration mode."
[86] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
[87] "In this section, we examine propane ODH catalysts and attempt to identify the phase or species that control the performance of the catalysts."
[88] "Groups V and VI transition metal oxides have been explored for use in the ODH of ethane and propane either as bulk catalysts or supported on higher surface area materials."
[89] "Vanadium has enjoyed more attention than other members of the groups, and VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield."
[90] "Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s)."
[91] "Propene selectivity of VMgO increase when promoted with alkali ions, but at the cost of a decline in activity."
[92] "The VMgO systems are usually characterized by several phases (MgV2O6, Mg2V2O7, Mg3V2O8, etc.), and there is no consensus on which of these phases is the most active for ODH."
[93] "V-hydroxylcalcium apatite has been reported to display similar catalytic performance as VMgO systems ( 30% propene yield)."
[94] "Propene yields from supported vanadium catalysts are generally lower than those of VMgO systems."
[95] "Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with increasing VOx (isolated monovanadates or polyvanadate) surface density until there is monolayer coverage of the support."
[96] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area."
[97] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."
[98] "Supported molybdenum catalysts follow the same trend as supported vanadium; they are characterized by higher propene selectivity but lower yield than vanadium counterparts due to their lower activity."
[99] "The turnover rates in the ODH of propane correlate with reducibility of ZrO2 supported VOx, MoOx, NbOx and WOx catalysts."
[100] "ODH rates have also been linked to H2 reduction of the metal oxides."
[101] "However, Khodakov et al. argue that H2 reduction of an oxide does not give sufficient insight into the elementary steps taking place on the catalyst surface."
[102] "They found that UVvisible absorption edge energy is a more consistent tool for predicting ODH activity of metal oxides, and explained this as the UVvisible absorption edge measures the energy of metal-ligand (oxygen) electrons transfer of the metal oxide."
[103] "ODH turnover of propane, and propene formation rates increase with a decrease in the electronic transition energies of the supported metal oxides."
[104] "VOx is the most promising ODH catalyst among the groups V and VI transition metal oxides."
[105] "However, there remains the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over the VOx (groups V and VI transition metal oxides)."
[106] "This challenge is summarized in the macro-kinetic reaction network of propane over VOx catalysts."
[107] "Kinetic data of ODH for propane on ZrO2 supported VOx, MoOx, NbOx and WOx catalysts follow a Marsvan Krevelen model."
[108] "In this model, alkanes react with lattice oxygen of the oxo metal species."
[109] "This creates oxygen vacancies in the catalyst and the oxygen-deficient oxo metal species are re-oxidized via interaction with adsorbed O2."
[110] "The adsorbed oxygen molecule can be incorporated into the oxo metal species through sequential reduction processes: O2(g)  O2(ads)  O2-  O22-  O-  O2- ."
[111] "The reaction order of ODH reactions with respect to alkanes is usually one, or unity."
[112] "This suggests weak surface adsorption of alkane on the catalyst(s), or that the alkane reacts from the gas phase via the EleyRideal mechanism."
[113] "However, the reaction order with respect to oxygen varies between zero and 0.5, which suggests a continuum of species, from exclusively lattice oxygen atoms to adsorbed oxygen atoms, are involved in the CH activation."
[114] "Using kinetic isotopic studies, Iglesia et al. demonstrated that the selective ODH path and direct combustion of propane (k1 and k2) share the same rate-determining step; for both reaction paths, CH activation is the kinetically relevant step."
[115] "One suggested explanation for the increase in k3 with increasing propane conversion, is that the allylic CH bond in propene is weaker than the methylene CH bond in propane."
[116] "Hence, propene has high propensity to undergo further oxidation in the ODH reaction condition."
[117] "However, Zboray et al. have shown that the rate of alkene combustion depends strongly on heat of adsorption of alkenes and only slightly on the presence of weak allylic CH bonds."
[118] "The heats of adsorption of alkenes on acidic sites are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes."
[119] "Hence the value k3 may be linked to an increasing surface propene/propane ratio increasing propane conversion."
[120] "Propene adsorbs on the acid sites more readily than propane does, leading to increased surface residence time and susceptibility to attack by surface oxygen species."
[121] "There are two sources of acid sites on a supported VOx catalyst  the V-centre and the support material."
[122] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali ions has been shown to increase propene selectivity but at the expense of a decrease in propane conversion due to lower reducibility of the VOx or MoOx domain."
[123] "The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity."
[124] "Dinse et al. argue that increasing the extent of the VOx phase reduction decreases its Lewis acidity, which, in turn, decreases ethene adsorption and combustion."
[125] "Ovsitser et al. also observed that increasing the extent of reduction of VOx phase by propane leads to higher propene selectivity."
[126] "The V in supported VOx phase has one V = O and three VOS or VOV ligand oxygen species (where VOS is the oxygen ligand bridging V and the support; and VOV is the oxygen ligand bridging two V)."
[127] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species."
[128] "Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds."
[129] "There was an earlier consensus that the V = O ligand is the lattice oxygen species in VOx ODH catalysts that is responsible for the k1 path in Fig. 9 ."
[130] "Hence, proposed mechanisms of ODH of alkanes over supported VOx catalysts assume the VO ligand is a critical part of the catalyst."
[131] "From Fig. 10 , ODH can follow the path of reduction of V5 +  V3 + or V5 +  V4 +."
[132] "Dinse et al. used high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance EPR to determine the oxidation states of vanadium species TiO2-, Î³-Al2O3-, and SiO2 (SBA-15) on supported VOx catalysts, before and after being used for ODH of propane."
[133] "They did not detect any V3 + in any of the samples."
[134] "The V3 + species was therefore considered either short-lived or non-existent during ODH of propane."
[135] "They found only one kind of V4 + surface site in the SBA-15 support catalyst, but different kinds of V4 + sites are present in the alumina-supported VOx catalyst, while V4 + centers are not detected in the titanium-supported catalyst."
[136] "Ti3 + and surface-trapped electrons (O2 radicals) are generated by the catalytic reaction of the TiO2-supported catalyst."
[137] "The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction."
[138] "After exposure to reaction conditions, carbon-centered radicals are detected in SBA-15, while oxo-radicals are found on alumina-supported catalysts."
[139] "Kondratenko and Brckner investigated the nature of active oxygen species that were formed when the initial lattice oxygen of the catalyst is used up."
[140] "They used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect formation of a Vn + O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species on the surface of a pre-reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalyst, after contact with gas-phase O2."
[141] "The oxygen species, identified by spectra simulation, reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO at room temperature."
[142] "However, no radical species was observed when O2 was replaced with N2O as the oxidant."
[143] "This is explained by N2O decomposing to N2 followed by rapid formation of nucleophilic O2  oxide ions."
[144] "In summary, a large proportion of CH activation on supported VOx catalysts occurs through homolytic CH bond scission following the V5 +  V4 + reduction pathway."
[145] "As mentioned in Section 4.1.1 , this lower VOx reduction pathway reportedly leads to poor alkene selectivity."
[146] "We can rationalize that scission of the dÏ bond of VO may yields a diradical species, VO The oxygen radical end cleaves the CH bond, forming an OH bond and an alkyl radical, while the lone electron on the vanadium radical interacts with O2 to form an oxo-radical or non-lattice O2 species."
[147] "Thus, the poor selectivity of this V5 +  V4 + reduction pathway becomes traceable to the highly reactive radical intermediates (alkyl, oxo-radical and non-lattice O2 species) and less likely due to the Lewis acidity of the V-centre as suggested by Dinse et al."
[148] "Although the CH activation over VOx discussed thus far has V = O at its center, there are reports that contest whether V = O is the source of the active oxygen for CH activation and other catalytic reactions of supported MOx catalysts."
[149] "Muylaert and Voort argued that M = O functionality is too stable relative to other surface oxygen ligands to constitute the CH activation site."
[150] "While this issue is yet to be resolved unequivocally, analyses on factors affecting alkene selectivity in the ODH of alkanes suggest that eliminating the homolytic CH activation mechanism can be a key to designing an optimal catalyst for ODH of alkanes."
[151] "Identification of the phase or species that can lead to a heterolytic CH activation pathway is a step toward achieving this objective."
[152] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity."
[153] "Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al. reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3."
[154] "They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."
[155] "Schacht et al. indicate an unprecedented propene selectivity using a VOx catalyst prepared by vanadium doping at the interlayer of MgAl-layered double hydroxides; these authors report that 99.97% propene selectivity is obtained at 21% propane conversion over 26.2% VOx/MgAlO (Mg/Al = 3, calcined at 973 K for 6 h) using a C3H8:O:N2 (17:17:66) feed at 693 K."
[156] "X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalyst revealed V5 + and V3 + oxidations of vanadium before and after the reaction, respectively."
[157] "The authors noted that performance of the catalyst is closely related to Mg/Al ratio and interlayer integration of vanadium in the catalyst precursor, double layer hydroxide."
[158] "In contrast to Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 supported VOx catalysts (where the VOx is anchored on the support via covalent bond and the vanadium center was not reduced below V4 +), the VOx in the VOx/MgAlO catalyst is adsorbed on the double layer hydroxide by ionic interaction and this mode affords a deeper extent of reduction of the vanadium center."
[159] "Similar V5 +/V3 + redox couple was reported by Kenta et al."
[160] "Isolated VO43  species were identified as the active site in a vanadium catalyst prepared from V(t-BuO)3O loaded with SiO2."
[161] "The active sites became reduced to the V3 + species and regenerated by molecular oxygen during the ODH of propane."
[162] "The unprecedented selectivity of the VOx/MgAlO may be attributed to the heterolytic CH activation pathway, the reduction of V5 + to V3 + and the weak surface acidity of the catalyst."
[163] "Water is a by-product in ODH, and in the presence of water the Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides regenerate and restore the favorable conditions for the V3 +/V5 + redox cycle."
[164] "Non-stoichiometric metal oxides are known to have redox properties that are relevant for catalytic applications."
[165] "NiOx is a non-stoichiometric oxide, and the Ni-center has various oxidation states."
[166] "The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes."
[167] "Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism , there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the CH activation step."
[168] "Since electron-deficient late transition metal cations are electrophilic, direct participation of the Ni-center via electrophilic metalation cannot be ruled out."
[169] "NiOLiCl/SZ (entry 1 in Table 3 ) gives higher performance with ethane than with propane."
[170] "Ethane conversion and selectivity are higher (about 5 and 1.5 times, respectively) than that of propane."
[171] "The lower selectivity with propane may be attributable to a higher propensity of propene for side reactions on acid sites of the catalyst surface."
[172] "However, lower propane conversion is, in contrast, expected to follow the reactivity order of the alkanes (propane > ethane) based on the CH bond energies."
[173] "The reaction conditions are similar for propane and ethane, and the difference in reaction rate may be attributable to reaction compatibility of the CH of the alkanes to the active oxygen species."
[174] "It is generally accepted that the rate-limiting step of ODH is abstraction of the first hydrogen from the alkane."
[175] "From the catalysts in Table 3 , it is difficult to make a direct claim about the nature of the hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in the rate-limiting step."
[176] "Considering the tendency of electrophilic metalation in CH activation, the rate-limiting step is most likely proton abstraction."
[177] "Different oxygen species are on the catalyst surface with varied nucleophilicity."
[178] "Idriss and Seebauer correlate reaction rates over oxidation catalysts that involve hydride transfer with chemical harness (polarizability) of surface ligands."
[179] "Polarizability of the catalyst oxygen species is a function of surface perturbation."
[180] "The order of polarizability of surface oxygen species is: O2 < O < O < O22 < O2 < O2."
[181] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."
[182] "It appears that some degree of compatibility is present between the CH of ethane and the active oxygen species in NiOLiCl/SZ."
[183] "Comparison of the performance of NiOLiCl/SZ with other Ni-based catalysts (entries 8, 9 in Table 3 ) for ODH of ethane shows similar ethene selectivity but higher ethane conversion for NiOLiCl/SZ."
[184] "The superior performance of NiOLiCl/SZ is strongly related to the presence and synergy of LiCl with NiO."
[185] "Lithium and halide containing catalysts are discussed in the next section, as is the potential of optimizing such catalyst systems toward high propene yield in the ODH of propane."
[186] "Entries 37 of Table 3 show similar propene yield, probably because the active oxygen species are produced on the catalysts during the reaction."
[187] "Differences in propane conversion and propene selectivities may be due to difference in catalyst surface areas and space velocities."
[188] "A number of lithium-doped alkaline earth metal oxides have been investigated for use during ODH of lower alkanes."
[189] "ODH activities of these catalysts are generally low at temperatures below 550 C."
[190] "But at higher temperatures, and in the presence of halide compounds as promoters, ODH activity and alkene selectivities of Li-based catalysts increase with increasing temperature."
[191] "ODH over these catalysts proceeds via heterogeneous-homogeneous or EleyRideal mechanisms."
[192] "This is in contrast to ODH over vanadium-based catalysts which proceed via the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, in which removal and replenishment of active (lattice) oxygen is a key elementary step."
[193] "The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical."
[194] "The CH activation takes place on the surface of the catalyst while subsequent transformation of the alkyl radical to alkene takes place in gas phase."
[195] "Product selectivity is thus largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry."
[196] "Leveles et al. investigated activation of propane over Li/MgO and found that only a small fraction of the oxygen ions in Li/MgO catalysts can be removed by reduction with H2 at 600 C."
[197] "Catalytic activity of Li/MgO is strongly correlated with the number of oxygen vacancies created by the reductive thermal treatment."
[198] "Leveles et al. suggested that active sites (oxygen species) are created by Li defects on MgO (as [Li+ O]) and that the active site activates the propane molecule via hydrogen atom abstraction and formation of a propyl radical."
[199] "The hydrogen atom reacts with surface oxygen species (O) to form a surface hydroxyl radical (OH)."
[200] "The remaining transformations of the propyl in the gas phase and regeneration of the active site proposed by Leveles et al."
[201] "Propyl radical Active site i-C3H7.  C3H6 + H O2 + Li+ OH  HO2. + Li+ O n-C3H7.  C2H4 + CH3. HO2. + Li+ OH  H2O2 + Li+ O"
[202] "CH3. + C3H8  CH4 + C3H7. H2O2  2.OH"
[203] "H + C3H8  H2 + C3H7. Li+ OH + OH  H2O + Li+ O Table 5 shows the performance of some ODH catalysts that contain lithium and halides."
[204] "Catalysts containing a halide ion display higher alkene selectivities than halide-free catalysts (entry 4 of Table 5 )."
[205] "Alkene selectivity increases with decreasing Lewis acidity of the metal ions ( Table 5 , entries 1, 7b & 7d vs. entries 2, 3, 4, 5, 7a & 7c)."
[206] "Based on the heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism, after activation of alkane on the catalyst surface, propagation steps take place in the gas phase."
[207] "Product selectivity of ODH of propane on Li/MgO had been analyzed by Leveles et al."
[208] "They argue that radical chemistry favors high propene selectivity since the allyl radical (C3H5.) is more stable than the propyl radical (C3H7.), and propene is more stable than propane in the gas phase."
[209] "Hence, unwanted reactions of propene occur mainly on the catalyst surface."
[210] "Increasing surface Lewis acidity increases the tendency of re-adsorption of alkenes and unwanted reactions on the catalyst."
[211] "Titration of acid sites in Li/Dy/Mg/O/Cl with potassium (entries 7b & 7d in Table 5 ) decreases the ability of the catalyst to activate propane at the primary carbon atom."
[212] "Gaab et al."
[213] "investigated the kinetics and mechanisms for ODH of ethane using the catalysts Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl)."
[214] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of Dy2O3Mg/O with LiNO3 and LiCl, leading to Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl), respectively."
[215] "The reaction rate on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) was an order of magnitude greater than that on Li/Dy/Mg/O."
[216] "The reaction mechanisms on Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) and Li/Dy/Mg/O/are purely heterogeneous and heterogeneous-homogeneous, respectively."
[217] "During the reaction, LiCl melts and reacts with adsorbed oxygen to form [Li+ OCl]."
[218] "The proposed sequence of the elementary steps of ethane conversion over Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl) are as follows: The catalytic cycle is similar to the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism; the active site, [OCl] is formed in situ by interaction of a surface chloride ion with dissociatively adsorbed oxygen molecule."
[219] "After CH activation, the active site transforms to [OH] and HCl."
[220] "Subsequently, the [OH] is discharged as H2O while the chloride ion re-enters the catalytic cycle."
[221] "The ethane conversion occurs via simultaneous abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by [OCl.]."
[222] "The active site is a radical complex of two nucleophilic atoms, each capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate."
[223] "This type of ODH catalyst system is not restricted to alkali metal halide-doped alkaline earth metal oxides."
[224] "The halide promotion effect has also been observed in materials with defective oxygen atoms and in ODH catalysts based on rare earth oxides promoted with fluoride ions."
[225] "The catalysts prepared include: CeO2/2CeF3, Sm2O3/4CeF3, Nd2O3/4CeF3 and Y2O3/4CeF3."
[226] "CeO2/2CeF3 displays the best performance with very high propene selectivity ( Table 6 , entry 1), even without Li doping."
[227] "The ODH activity of CeO2/2CeF3 is due to the presence of lattice oxygen or the redox property of CeO2, and the high propene selectivity may be attributed to the formation of similar active sites as described for Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl)."
[228] "Wang and co-workers impregnated commercial SiO2 with alkali chlorides and created catalysts after calcination at 700 C for 3 h."
[229] "The resulting catalysts were tested for ODH of ethane."
[230] "The authors hypothesized that the addition of alkali metal chloride would produce oxygen defects in SiO2."
[231] "The performances of the catalysts are presented in Table 6 (entries 2a, 2b & 2c)."
[232] "Ethene yields of the catalysts increase with increasing Lewis acidity of the alkali ion, but the catalysts' stability follows the order: Na > Li > K."
[233] "In entries 3 and 4 of Table 6 , a chlorine compound is co-fed with the propane/O2 feed streams."
[234] "The presence of the chlorine compound reportedly increases propene selectivity in each case."
[235] "A chloride modified MoO3/SiO2-TiO2 was also reported by Chang et al. to improve propene selectivity compared to a chloride-free catalyst."
[236] "A close look at Table 5 , Table 6 show that reaction temperatures are generally higher in the alkali metal halide catalysts due to their higher reduction temperatures."
[237] "ODH activities of the catalysts are related to presence of dual nucleophilic atoms in the active site."
[238] "Nucleophilicity of the initial lattice oxygen depends on the dopant cation."
[239] "The rational choice of the dopant cation can increase the alkene selectivity of the catalyst."
[240] "Interaction of LiCl with an adsorbed oxygen atom results in a nucleophilic species capable of dual attack on an alkane substrate."
[241] "Propene selectivity is reported to increase with increasing mobility of the chloride ion in M/Dy/Mg/O/Cl (M = Li, Na, K) catalysts, but this comes at the expense of a lower propene yield due to the increased melting point of the chlorides."
[242] "CeO2/2CeF3 gives moderate propane conversion rates with high propene selectivity."
[243] "Doping CeO2/2CeF3 with a cation of high redox potential and of comparable Lewis acid strength with Li should be explored for enhanced propane conversion."
[244] "In conclusion, we examined catalysts and reaction routes with potential for dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes."
[245] "The main approaches to alkane dehydrogenation are: non-oxidative, autothermal and oxidative dehydrogenation."
[246] "The non-oxidative approach, despite its inherent thermodynamic hurdles and kinetic complications has been developed to industrial-level standards using chromium or platinum-based catalysts with different reactor configurations."
[247] "CH activation is a key elementary step in alkane-alkene conversion."
[248] "The platinum-based catalysts activate the CH bond via an oxidative addition mechanism, while CH activation using chromium-based catalysts occur via Lewis base-assisted deprotonation."

[250] "For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism."
[251] "The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts."
[252] "This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding."
[253] "The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls."
[254] "However, the performances of oxidative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are not yet attractive for industrial operations."
[255] "Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes."
[256] "The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts."
[257] "VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity."
[258] "Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms."
[259] "Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts."
[260] "Thus CH activation on heterogeneous catalysts can be a continuum from an electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, depending on the metal center and the surface oxygen species of ligands."
[261] "This continuum had been identified for CH activation in homogeneous catalysts ."
[262] "CH activation is achieved at relatively milder conditions in these homogeneous catalyst systems."

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene directly from propane. PDH techniques can be categorized into non-oxidative, autothermal, and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative PDH, despite its high energy requirement, has been developed using chromium or platinum-based catalysts with different reactor configurations. Autothermal PDH seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative PDH by utilizing sacrificial fuel or selective hydrogen combustion. Oxidative PDH, on the other hand, is an exothermic process that can offset the energy requirement of non-oxidative PDH. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For example, using zeolites can enhance the stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. In autothermal PDH, catalyst design and reactor configuration are targeted at selective and efficient combustion of the sacrificial fuel to supply the heat required to ignite and sustain the gas phase endothermic dehydrogenation. In oxidative PDH, the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts, and VOx phase(s) in which the oxygen ligands of VOx are bonded to the catalyst support by non-covalent forces are critical for high alkene selectivity.
