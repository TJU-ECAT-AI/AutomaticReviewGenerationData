1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes offer an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, addressing the challenges of traditional methods. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The use of ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 as a catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an example of such a strategy. This catalyst system exhibits high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability, making it a promising option for industrial propylene production.
