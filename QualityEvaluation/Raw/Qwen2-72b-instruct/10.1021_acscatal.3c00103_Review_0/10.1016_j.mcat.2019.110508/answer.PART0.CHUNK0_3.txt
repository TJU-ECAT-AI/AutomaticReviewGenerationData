1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering an alternative route for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to exhibit high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability in PDH reactions. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with its good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are proposed to be the active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

1.工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性促使了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，这些技术通过提供丙烯生产的替代途径来应对这些挑战。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善循环利用性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，这些策略在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中都有应用。这些策略包括使用高硅HZSM-5沸石作为ZnO催化剂的载体，这些催化剂在PDH反应中表现出高催化活性、稳定性和可重复使用性。高硅HZSM-5沸石，具有良好的纹理性质、明确定义的结构和适度的酸性，有助于分散Zn物种并减少副反应。此外，直接与HZSM-5沸石框架相连的小ZnO簇被提议为活性相，这些簇在具有精细结构条件和稀疏Al位点的沸石载体上大量产生。支持在高硅HZSM-5上的ZnO催化剂成本低、无毒、可重复使用，因此在工业丙烯生产中具有前景。
