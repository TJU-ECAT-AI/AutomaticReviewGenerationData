          Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

          工业对丙烯的需求增加和传统生产方法的局限性促使了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。PDH过程通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，绕过了对蒸汽裂解的需求，解决了这些挑战。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，这些策略适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。这些策略包括使用高硅HZSM-5沸石作为ZnO催化剂的载体，这已被证明可以提高催化剂的催化活性和稳定性。高硅HZSM-5沸石，具有良好的纹理性能，明确定义的结构和调整良好的酸性，有助于分散Zn物种并减少副反应。此外，有人提出，直接与HZSM-5沸石框架相连的小ZnO簇是活性相，当沸石载体具有精细结构条件和稀疏的Al位点时，这些簇大量产生。支持在高硅HZSM-5上的ZnO催化剂成本低，无毒性，可重复使用，因此在工业丙烯生产中具有前景。
