1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, PDH techniques offer an alternative route to produce propylene from propane, a widely available feedstock. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the use of high-silica HZSM-5 as a support for ZnO catalysts has shown promise in direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, thus representing a promising approach for industrial propylene production.

1.在工业对丙烯需求日益增长以及传统生产方法局限性的背景下，PDH技术为从丙烷这一广泛可用的原料生产丙烯提供了一条替代途径。为了克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。例如，使用高硅HZSM-5作为ZnO催化剂的载体，在直接脱氢丙烷制丙烯方面显示出潜力。高硅HZSM-5沸石，具有良好的纹理性能、明确定义的结构和调整得当的酸性，有助于分散Zn物种并减少副反应。此外，有人提出，直接与HZSM-5沸石框架相连的小ZnO簇是活性相，当沸石载体具有精细结构条件和稀疏的Al位点时，这些簇大量产生。高硅HZSM-5支撑的ZnO催化剂成本低、无毒、可重复使用，因此为工业丙烯生产提供了一种有前景的方法。
