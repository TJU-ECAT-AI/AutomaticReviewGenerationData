[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
[7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
[8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
[9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
[14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
[15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
[19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
[20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."
[21] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system."
[22] "This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."
[23] "A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves."
[24] "The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired."
[25] "Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[26] "Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for the production of propylene from propane. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes can be classified into nonoxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation, with the former being limited by thermodynamic equilibrium and the latter offering the potential for full conversion of the paraffin by combusting the hydrogen formed during the reaction.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For nonoxidative PDH, metal oxide-based catalysts such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx have received significant attention as alternatives to the widely used PtSn and CrOx systems. However, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is needed to address these issues and develop more stable and recyclable catalysts.
3.In oxidative PDH, the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction, is being explored as an alternative solution. Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case, oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion. However, the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, requiring frequent regeneration with oxygen. Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low, and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application.
4.Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. However, the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过为从丙烷生产丙烯提供替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的局限性。这些技术在最近页岩气产量激增的背景下尤其相关，这使得天然气作为原料比原油更具经济性。PDH过程可以分为非氧化脱氢和氧化脱氢，前者受热力学平衡的限制，而后者通过在反应中燃烧形成的氢气，为完全转化石蜡提供了潜力。
2.正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服非氧化和氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性并改善可回收性。对于非氧化PDH，金属氧化物基催化剂，如GaOx、MoOx和VOx，作为广泛使用的PtSn和CrOx系统的替代品，受到了广泛关注。然而，这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，其活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。需要进一步的研究来解决这些问题，开发更稳定和可回收的催化剂。
3.在氧化PDH中，正在探索使用固体氧载体，如CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3，能够选择性地氧化SHC反应中产生的氢气，作为替代解决方案。贵金属，如Pt和Au，也可以催化SHC过程，但在这种情况下，需要共喂氧以促进氢气的燃烧。然而，SHC反应消耗金属氧化物催化剂的晶格氧，需要频繁地用氧再生。此外，反应速率相对较低，一些金属氧化物具有高毒性。需要解决这些问题，才能使这种方法在工业应用中可行。
4.另一种从反应混合物中去除氢气的方法是在反应器系统中引入膜。这种方法允许氢气从反应器中扩散，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品移动。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的逆向关系是一个严重的问题，因为两者都是需要的。催化剂失活是另一个挑战，因为当氢气分压下降时，焦炭沉积会增加。然而，几乎所有研究都报告说，当使用膜系统时，烯烃产量会增加。
