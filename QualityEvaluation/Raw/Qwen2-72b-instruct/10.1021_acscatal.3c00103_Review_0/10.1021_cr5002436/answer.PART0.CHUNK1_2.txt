[1] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[2] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[3] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[4] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen. Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."
[5] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."
[6] "A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves."
[7] "The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired. Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[8] "Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, alternative catalyst formulations for PDH, such as metal oxides, deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover activity through regeneration. To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being explored. One approach is the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen produced during the PDH reaction. Noble metals like Pt and Au can also catalyze the PDH process, but require co-fed oxygen for hydrogen combustion. However, issues with the frequent regeneration of metal oxide catalysts, low reaction rates, and toxicity of some metal oxides need to be resolved for these approaches to be viable for industrial application. Another strategy is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system, which allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor and shifts the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. Membranes such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves have been investigated. However, the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of membranes is a challenge, as both are desired properties. Catalyst deactivation due to increased coke deposition when hydrogen partial pressure drops is another issue. Despite these challenges, studies have shown increased olefin yields when using membrane systems in PDH processes.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术应运而生。然而，PDH的替代催化剂配方，如金属氧化物，由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复活性而过快失活。为解决这些挑战，正在探索创新的催化剂设计策略。一种方法是使用固体氧载体，如CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3，这些载体可以有选择性地氧化PDH反应中产生的氢气。像Pt和Au这样的贵金属也可以催化PDH过程，但需要共喂氧来燃烧氢气。然而，金属氧化物催化剂频繁再生、反应速率低以及某些金属氧化物的毒性问题需要解决，这些方法才能在工业应用中可行。另一种策略是在反应器系统中引入膜，使氢气能够从反应器中扩散出去，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品移动。已经研究了诸如Pd涂层介孔氧化铝、PtAg复合材料以及钼或碳基分子筛等膜。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的反比关系是一个挑战，因为两者都是所需的性质。当氢气分压下降时，催化剂失活由于焦炭沉积增加而成为一个问题。尽管存在这些挑战，但研究表明，当使用膜系统时，PDH过程中的烯烃产量会增加。
