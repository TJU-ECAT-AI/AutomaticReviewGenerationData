1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by providing a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies. The profitability of PDH is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that they are on-purpose techniques, yielding exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, many of which are already under construction. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States. The supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins. The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies. In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved, allowing large volumes of shale gas to be extracted in a cost-effective manner. This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs, making shale gas very attractive as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals.

1.工业丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性导致了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，这些技术通过提供更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术来应对这些挑战。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的另一个优势是，脱氢是一种有目的的技术，它只产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品。工业脱氢过程目前被优化，可以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。预计在未来的几年里，全球将有数十个新的PDH装置宣布，其中许多装置已经在建设中。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致了从基于石油的石脑油到基于页岩的乙烷的转变，用于美国的蒸汽裂解装置，乙烷裂解装置正在建设中，石脑油裂解装置正在被拆除或转换。相对于石脑油裂解，乙烷的蒸汽裂解产生的烯烃除了乙烯之外几乎可以忽略不计，这就是为什么丙烯的供应已经下降，其价格急剧上升，为有目的的催化技术创造了机会，如轻质石蜡催化脱氢成相应的烯烃。传统过程的高能量需求，对特定烯烃生产的低选择性，石油储备的减少和油价的上涨正在推动石化行业寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。近年来，水力压裂或压裂技术得到了改进，可以以成本效益的方式提取大量页岩气。这种天然气供应的增加导致天然气成本相对于2005年的价格下降了约75%，这使得页岩气作为能源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料非常有吸引力。
