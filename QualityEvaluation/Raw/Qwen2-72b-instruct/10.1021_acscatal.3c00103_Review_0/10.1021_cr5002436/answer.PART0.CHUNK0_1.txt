[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[6] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[7] "The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[8] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[9] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[10] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[11] "The recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by taking advantage of the favorable market conditions created by the price difference between propane and propylene. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propylene, instead of a mixture of products, and can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. The profitability of PDH is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions very favorable. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of supported metal catalysts, such as Pt and CrOx, which are active in the metallic state and require a reduction step prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, but side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles. The use of promoters, such as tin, zinc, and alkali metals, can modify the catalytic properties of platinum and suppress side reactions. The addition of promoters can also retard the sintering of platinum nanoparticles and facilitate the migration of coke precursors from the metal surface to the support. The use of more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, can also reduce the acidity of the support and improve the stability of the catalyst. The use of zeolites as an alternative support can stabilize small PtSn particles in the micropores of the support and improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The use of mesoporous silica as a support can also improve the stability of the catalyst by reducing the sintering of platinum nanoparticles. The use of more stable supports, such as zirconia, can also improve the stability of the catalyst by reducing the acidity of the support and improving the sintering resistance of the active phase.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过利用丙烷和丙烯价格差异创造的有利市场条件，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的问题。PDH是一种特定目的的技术，产生特定的烯烃，丙烯，而不是混合产品，并且可以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置，正在建造乙烷裂解器，而石脑油裂解器要么被拆除要么被转换。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。全球宣布了数十个新的PDH装置，其中许多装置已经在建设中。对于丁烷的脱氢，由于来自汽车行业的特别需求增加，加上由于石脑油裂解的高成本导致供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨，因此存在同样有利的市场情况。这反过来又刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢(BDH)装置的投资。
2.为了克服氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，包括使用如Pt和CrOx的负载金属催化剂，它们在金属状态下是活性的，并且在反应前需要还原步骤。轻烷烃的脱氢反应对铂粒子的结构不敏感，但氢解、异构化和焦炭形成等副反应对铂粒子的结构敏感。使用如锡、锌和碱金属的促进剂可以修改铂的催化性质并抑制副反应。添加促进剂还可以减缓铂纳米粒子的烧结并促进焦炭前体从金属表面到支撑物的迁移。使用如θ或α氧化铝的更稳定的氧化铝多晶型物也可以通过减少支撑物的酸性来提高催化剂的稳定性。使用沸石作为替代支撑物可以在支撑物的微孔中稳定小的PtSn粒子，从而提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。使用介孔二氧化硅作为支撑物也可以通过减少铂纳米粒子的烧结来提高催化剂的稳定性。使用如氧化锆的更稳定的支撑物也可以通过减少支撑物的酸性和提高活性相的烧结抗性来提高催化剂的稳定性。
