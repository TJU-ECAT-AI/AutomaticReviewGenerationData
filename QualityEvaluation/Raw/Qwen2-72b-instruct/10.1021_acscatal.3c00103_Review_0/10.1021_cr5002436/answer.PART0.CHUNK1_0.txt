[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
[7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
[8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
[9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
[14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
[15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
[19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
[20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues.
3.Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system.
4.Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供丙烯生产的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的局限性。这些技术特别适用于最近页岩气产量激增的背景下，使天然气成为比原油更经济的原料。PDH过程，特别是使用PtSn和CrOx催化剂的过程，已经发展到可以连续运行数年的程度，使其与传统方法具有竞争力。然而，当前的脱氢技术仍有改进空间，需要进一步的进展来降低贵金属负载，提高催化剂稳定性，并提高脱氢过程的能源效率。
2.正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服非氧化和氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，增强稳定性，并提高可回收性。尽管金属氧化物（GaOx，MoOx，VOx）等替代催化剂受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出实用的PtSn和CrOx系统的替代品。这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，且其活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。需要进一步的研究来解决这些问题。
3.正在探索氧化脱氢作为有前景的替代方案，它没有非氧化脱氢的热力学限制。在氧化脱氢中，氧化剂燃烧反应中形成的氢气，允许完全转化石蜡。O2和CO2是最受研究的氧化剂，各有其独特的优势和劣势。O2消除了焦炭沉积，降低了反应温度，并使脱氢反应成为放热反应，但引入了避免石蜡过氧化以保持高烯烃选择性的挑战。CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以在脱氢条件下消耗H2，而不会氧化石蜡，但结果是热量形成较少，使脱氢反应保持吸热。CO2的共进料可能会由于逆水煤气变换反应导致额外的焦炭沉积，但也可以气化焦炭。CO2在表面上竞争性吸附，影响催化剂性能。找到合适的催化剂材料和氧化剂组合对于开发有效的氧化脱氢系统至关重要。
4.正在探索使用固体氧载体（CeO2，SbO4，In2O3，WO3，PbOx，Tl2O3，BiO3）和贵金属（Pt，Au）进行选择性氢燃烧的替代解决方案。然而，这些方法需要频繁地用氧气再生金属氧化物催化剂，反应速率相对较低，一些金属氧化物具有高度毒性。需要解决这些问题，才能使这些方法在工业应用中成为可行。
