[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
[7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
[8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
[9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
[13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
[14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
[15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
[19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
[20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues.
3.Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system.
4.Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供丙烯生产的替代途径，解决了工业对丙烯日益增长的需求以及传统生产方法的局限性。这些技术特别适用于最近页岩气产量激增的背景下，使天然气成为比原油更经济的原料。PDH过程，特别是使用PtSn和CrOx催化剂的过程，已经发展到可以连续运行数年的程度，使其与传统方法具有竞争力。然而，当前的脱氢技术仍有改进空间，需要进一步的进展来降低贵金属负载，提高催化剂稳定性，并提高脱氢过程的能源效率。
2.正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服非氧化和氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，增强稳定性，并提高可回收性。尽管金属氧化物（GaOx，MoOx，VOx）等替代催化剂受到了广泛关注，但尚未开发出实用的PtSn和CrOx系统的替代品。这些替代配方失活速度过快，主要是由于焦炭沉积，且其活性无法通过再生步骤完全恢复。需要进一步的研究来解决这些问题。
3.正在探索氧化脱氢作为有前景的替代方案，它没有非氧化脱氢的热力学限制。在氧化脱氢中，氧化剂燃烧反应中形成的氢气，允许完全转化石蜡。O2和CO2是最受研究的氧化剂，各有其独特的优势和劣势。O2消除了焦炭沉积，降低了反应温度，并使脱氢反应成为放热反应，但引入了避免石蜡过氧化以保持高烯烃选择性的挑战。CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以在脱氢条件下消耗H2，而不会氧化石蜡，但结果是热量形成较少，使脱氢反应保持吸热。CO2的共进料可能会由于逆水煤气变换反应导致额外的焦炭沉积，但也可以气化焦炭。CO2在表面上竞争性吸附，影响催化剂性能。找到合适的催化剂材料和氧化剂组合对于开发有效的氧化脱氢系统至关重要。
4.正在探索使用固体氧载体（CeO2，SbO4，In2O3，WO3，PbOx，Tl2O3，BiO3）和贵金属（Pt，Au）进行选择性氢燃烧的替代解决方案。然而，这些方法需要频繁地用氧气再生金属氧化物催化剂，反应速率相对较低，一些金属氧化物具有高度毒性。需要解决这些问题，才能使这些方法在工业应用中成为可行。

1.工业丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性导致了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，这些技术通过提供更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术来应对这些挑战。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的另一个优势是，脱氢是一种有目的的技术，它只产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品。工业脱氢过程目前被优化，可以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。预计在未来的几年里，全球将有数十个新的PDH装置宣布，其中许多装置已经在建设中。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致了从基于石油的石脑油到基于页岩的乙烷的转变，用于美国的蒸汽裂解装置，乙烷裂解装置正在建设中，石脑油裂解装置正在被拆除或转换。相对于石脑油裂解，乙烷的蒸汽裂解产生的烯烃除了乙烯之外几乎可以忽略不计，这就是为什么丙烯的供应已经下降，其价格急剧上升，为有目的的催化技术创造了机会，如轻质石蜡催化脱氢成相应的烯烃。传统过程的高能量需求，对特定烯烃生产的低选择性，石油储备的减少和油价的上涨正在推动石化行业寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。近年来，水力压裂或压裂技术得到了改进，可以以成本效益的方式提取大量页岩气。这种天然气供应的增加导致天然气成本相对于2005年的价格下降了约75%，这使得页岩气作为能源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料非常有吸引力。

4.另一种从反应混合物中去除氢气的方法是在反应器系统中引入膜。这种方法允许氢气从反应器中扩散，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品移动。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的逆向关系是一个严重的问题，因为两者都是需要的。催化剂失活是另一个挑战，因为当氢气分压下降时，焦炭沉积会增加。然而，几乎所有研究都报告说，当使用膜系统时，烯烃产量会增加。

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by taking advantage of the favorable market conditions created by the price difference between propane and propylene. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propylene, instead of a mixture of products, and can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. The profitability of PDH is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions very favorable. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of supported metal catalysts, such as Pt and CrOx, which are active in the metallic state and require a reduction step prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, but side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles. The use of promoters, such as tin, zinc, and alkali metals, can modify the catalytic properties of platinum and suppress side reactions. The addition of promoters can also retard the sintering of platinum nanoparticles and facilitate the migration of coke precursors from the metal surface to the support. The use of more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, can also reduce the acidity of the support and improve the stability of the catalyst. The use of zeolites as an alternative support can stabilize small PtSn particles in the micropores of the support and improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. The use of mesoporous silica as a support can also improve the stability of the catalyst by reducing the sintering of platinum nanoparticles. The use of more stable supports, such as zirconia, can also improve the stability of the catalyst by reducing the acidity of the support and improving the sintering resistance of the active phase.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过利用丙烷和丙烯价格差异创造的有利市场条件，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的问题。PDH是一种特定目的的技术，产生特定的烯烃，丙烯，而不是混合产品，并且可以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置，正在建造乙烷裂解器，而石脑油裂解器要么被拆除要么被转换。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。全球宣布了数十个新的PDH装置，其中许多装置已经在建设中。对于丁烷的脱氢，由于来自汽车行业的特别需求增加，加上由于石脑油裂解的高成本导致供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨，因此存在同样有利的市场情况。这反过来又刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢(BDH)装置的投资。
2.为了克服氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，包括使用如Pt和CrOx的负载金属催化剂，它们在金属状态下是活性的，并且在反应前需要还原步骤。轻烷烃的脱氢反应对铂粒子的结构不敏感，但氢解、异构化和焦炭形成等副反应对铂粒子的结构敏感。使用如锡、锌和碱金属的促进剂可以修改铂的催化性质并抑制副反应。添加促进剂还可以减缓铂纳米粒子的烧结并促进焦炭前体从金属表面到支撑物的迁移。使用如θ或α氧化铝的更稳定的氧化铝多晶型物也可以通过减少支撑物的酸性来提高催化剂的稳定性。使用沸石作为替代支撑物可以在支撑物的微孔中稳定小的PtSn粒子，从而提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。使用介孔二氧化硅作为支撑物也可以通过减少铂纳米粒子的烧结来提高催化剂的稳定性。使用如氧化锆的更稳定的支撑物也可以通过减少支撑物的酸性和提高活性相的烧结抗性来提高催化剂的稳定性。

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, alternative catalyst formulations for PDH, such as metal oxides, deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover activity through regeneration. To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being explored. One approach is the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen produced during the PDH reaction. Noble metals like Pt and Au can also catalyze the PDH process, but require co-fed oxygen for hydrogen combustion. However, issues with the frequent regeneration of metal oxide catalysts, low reaction rates, and toxicity of some metal oxides need to be resolved for these approaches to be viable for industrial application. Another strategy is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system, which allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor and shifts the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. Membranes such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves have been investigated. However, the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of membranes is a challenge, as both are desired properties. Catalyst deactivation due to increased coke deposition when hydrogen partial pressure drops is another issue. Despite these challenges, studies have shown increased olefin yields when using membrane systems in PDH processes.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术应运而生。然而，PDH的替代催化剂配方，如金属氧化物，由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复活性而过快失活。为解决这些挑战，正在探索创新的催化剂设计策略。一种方法是使用固体氧载体，如CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3，这些载体可以有选择性地氧化PDH反应中产生的氢气。像Pt和Au这样的贵金属也可以催化PDH过程，但需要共喂氧来燃烧氢气。然而，金属氧化物催化剂频繁再生、反应速率低以及某些金属氧化物的毒性问题需要解决，这些方法才能在工业应用中可行。另一种策略是在反应器系统中引入膜，使氢气能够从反应器中扩散出去，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品移动。已经研究了诸如Pd涂层介孔氧化铝、PtAg复合材料以及钼或碳基分子筛等膜。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的反比关系是一个挑战，因为两者都是所需的性质。当氢气分压下降时，催化剂失活由于焦炭沉积增加而成为一个问题。尽管存在这些挑战，但研究表明，当使用膜系统时，PDH过程中的烯烃产量会增加。

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，已经开发了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。然而，金属氧化物等替代催化剂由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复其活性而过快失活。为了解决这些挑战，正在探索创新的催化剂设计策略。一种方法是使用CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3等固体氧载体，它们可以选择性地氧化PDH反应中产生的氢气。Pt和Au等贵金属也可以催化PDH过程，但需要共喂氧以促进氢燃烧。然而，金属氧化物催化剂需要频繁再生、反应速率低以及某些金属氧化物的毒性等问题需要解决，这些方法才能适用于工业应用。另一种改进PDH过程的方法是在反应器系统中引入膜，使氢气能够从反应器中扩散出来，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品转移。已经研究了各种膜，包括Pd涂覆的介孔氧化铝、PtAg复合材料以及钼或碳基分子筛膜。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的反比关系是一个重大挑战，因为这两种性质都是可取的。当氢气分压下降时，催化剂失活和焦炭沉积增加是另一个问题。尽管存在这些挑战，研究表明使用膜系统可以提高烯烃产量。

[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[6] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[7] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[8] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
[9] "First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail."
[11] "Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed."
[12] "For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed."
[13] "Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance."
[14] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[15] "First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[16] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[17] "However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation."
[18] "Two main processes are believed to lead to the dissolution of Cr3+ into the Al2O3 carrier and result in catalytically inactive Cr3+ species."
[19] "First, the sintering of the alumina may cause entrapment of the Cr species inside the bulk of the support."
[20] "As an additional effect, the loss of alumina surface area reduces the ability of the support to stabilize Cr6+ species formed during the regeneration step."
[21] "Consequently, Cr3+ ions migrate into the support."
[22] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by taking advantage of the favorable market conditions determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products, and it can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The profitability of PDH is enhanced by the current market conditions, and dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, many of which are already under construction. The dehydrogenation of butanes is also advantageous due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The focus is on providing a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied, the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction, and the nature of the active sites of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. Other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts, are also being surveyed. The effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime is being discussed, and different catalysts are being compared in terms of the reaction mechanism, deactivation pathways, and catalytic performance. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include understanding the causes of deactivation, such as the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface leading to the coverage of active sites with coke and the agglomeration or sintering of platinum nanoparticles, and developing methods to regenerate the catalysts by combusting the coke deposits. In the case of CrOx-based catalysts, the dissolution of Cr3+ into the Al2O3 carrier and the entrapment of Cr species inside the bulk of the support due to the sintering of the alumina are being addressed to prevent the formation of catalytically inactive Cr3+ species.
