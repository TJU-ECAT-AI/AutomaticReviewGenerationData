[1] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[2] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[3] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
[4] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen. Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."
[5] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."
[6] "A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves."
[7] "The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired. Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops."
[8] "Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome these deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. One such strategy involves the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction. Noble metals like Pt and Au can also catalyze the SHC process, but oxygen must be cofed to facilitate hydrogen combustion. However, the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, requiring frequent regeneration with oxygen. The reaction rate is relatively low, and some metal oxides are highly toxic, issues that need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application. Another method to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system, allowing hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor and shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. However, the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, and catalyst deactivation is an additional challenge due to increased coke deposition when the hydrogen partial pressure drops. Despite these challenges, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术应运而生。然而，金属氧化物等替代催化剂由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复其活性而过快失活。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服这些失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善可回收性。一种策略是使用CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3等固体氧载体，这些载体可以有选择性地氧化SHC反应产生的氢气。Pt和Au等贵金属也可以催化SHC过程，但必须共喂氧以促进氢燃烧。然而，SHC反应消耗金属氧化物催化剂的晶格氧，需要频繁地用氧再生。反应速率相对较低，一些金属氧化物具有高度毒性，这些问题需要解决，才能使这种方法在工业应用中成为可行。另一种去除反应混合物中氢气的方法是在反应器系统中引入膜，使氢气能够从反应器中扩散出来，使平衡向所需的烯烃产品转移。然而，膜的渗透性和选择性之间的反比关系是一个严重的问题，催化剂失活是另一个挑战，因为当氢气分压下降时，焦炭沉积会增加。尽管存在这些挑战，几乎所有研究都报告说，当使用膜系统时，烯烃产量会增加。
