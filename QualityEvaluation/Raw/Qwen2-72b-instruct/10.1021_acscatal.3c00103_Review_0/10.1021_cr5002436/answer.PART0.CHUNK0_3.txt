[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[6] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[7] "The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[8] "The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is discussed."
[9] "The addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[10] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[11] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by taking advantage of the favorable market conditions determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products, and industrial processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is discussed as a strategy to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of various supports, such as silica, zirconia, zeolites, mesoporous silica, porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials, CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors, Cr-containing metalorganic-framework filled with an alumina precursor and subsequently combusting the organic material, a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst, titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants, CrOx/Al2O3ZrO2 catalyst, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2, and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts doped with alkali ions, silica, zirconia, magnesia, or lanthana. The use of lanthana to restrain the transformation of γ-alumina to α-alumina and to increase the pretreatment temperature of the alumina support is also being explored. These strategies aim to increase the number of multinuclear Cr3+ sites, the TOF shown by the resulting catalyst, the stability of Al2O3 polymorph, the dispersion of chromia crystallites, and the redispersion of chromia crystallites during regeneration. The redispersion of chromia crystallites during regeneration is crucial to improve activity, selectivity, recyclability, stability, and to address deactivation issues.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过利用丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异所决定的有利市场条件，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的问题。PDH是一种有目的的技术，专门生产特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品，并且工业过程被优化以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置。全球宣布了数十个新的PDH装置，其中许多装置已经在建设中。使用二氧化碳作为轻烷烃脱氢的温和氧化剂的策略被讨论，作为通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除产生的氢气，从而有效地将平衡向产品形成方向移动，以提高铬脱氢催化剂活性的方法。
2.正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和可回收性。这些策略包括使用各种载体，如二氧化硅、氧化锆、沸石、介孔二氧化硅、多孔铬酸盐柱撑α-磷酸锆材料、使用层状双氢氧化物(LDH)前体制备的CrMgAl和CrMg混合氧化物、使用铝前体填充的含铬金属有机框架随后燃烧有机材料、涉及几种热解分子前体的共热解法生产Cr/Si/Zr/O催化剂、掺杂Cr的介孔二氧化钛、CrOx/Al2O3ZrO2催化剂、CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2、以及掺杂碱金属离子、二氧化硅、氧化锆、氧化镁或镧的CrOx/Al2O3催化剂。正在探索使用镧来限制γ氧化铝向α氧化铝的转变，并提高氧化铝载体的预处理温度。这些策略旨在增加多核Cr3+位点的数量、所得催化剂的TOF、Al2O3多晶型的稳定性、铬酸盐晶体的分散度以及再生过程中铬酸盐晶体的再分散度。再生过程中铬酸盐晶体的再分散对于提高活性、选择性、可回收性、稳定性和解决失活问题至关重要。
