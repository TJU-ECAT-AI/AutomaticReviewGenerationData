1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative to traditional oil-based cracking processes for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by fluctuating global energy situations and the price differential between propane and propylene. Despite being commercialized for decades, these techniques face significant issues with thermally induced deactivation. To combat this, significant advancements have been made in the design of PDH catalysts to enhance stability and recyclability. Strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interactions, and modification of supports, all aimed at improving catalytic performance and longevity.
