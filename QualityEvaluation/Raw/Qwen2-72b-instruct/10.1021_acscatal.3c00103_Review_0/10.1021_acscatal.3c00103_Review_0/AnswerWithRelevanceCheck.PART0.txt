          Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

          The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

          面对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法（基于油基裂解过程）受到全球能源形势变化的挑战，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术，特别是非氧化PDH，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，提供了一个有前景的替代方案。然而，热诱导的失活仍然是一个重大问题。为了克服这一问题，已经取得了实质性的进展，开发了催化剂设计策略，重点是提高催化稳定性和可回收性。这些策略包括活性位点调控、增强金属-支撑物相互作用和支持物改性。
