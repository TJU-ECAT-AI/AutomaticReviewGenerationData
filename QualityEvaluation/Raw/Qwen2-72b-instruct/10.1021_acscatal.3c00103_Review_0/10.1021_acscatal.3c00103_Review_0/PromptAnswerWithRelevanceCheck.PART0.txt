[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation."
[2] "The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene."
[3] "Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem."
[4] "Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts."
[5] "The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification."

1.The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. These techniques address the challenges by utilizing the price difference between propane and propylene, making them economically attractive. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue in PDH processes. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing innovative catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification, all aimed at inhibiting deactivation and enhancing the performance of PDH catalysts.
