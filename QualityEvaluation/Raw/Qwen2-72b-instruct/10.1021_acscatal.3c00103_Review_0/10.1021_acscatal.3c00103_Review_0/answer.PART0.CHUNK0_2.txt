[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation."
[2] "The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene."
[3] "Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem."
[4] "Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts."
[5] "The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification."

1.The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Despite being commercialized for decades, PDH techniques face challenges with thermally induced deactivation. To overcome these issues, significant progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

1.面对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法（基于石油基裂解过程）受到全球能源形势变化的挑战，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术，特别是非氧化PDH，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，提供了一个有前景的替代方案。尽管PDH技术已经商业化了几十年，但热诱导的失活仍然是一个大问题。为了克服这些问题，人们在开发旨在提高催化稳定性和可回收性的催化剂设计策略方面取得了显著进展。这些策略包括活性位点调控、增强金属-支撑物相互作用和支持物改性。
