[1] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[2] "Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption."
[3] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking.29 Therefore, we attempt to design CoSn/NC as novel microwave catalyst for PDH under microwave irradiation, in which the cobalt as the active site, the Sn as the promoter and the carbon nitride phase as the catalyst support."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, toxicity, and long-term coking and cracking. These catalysts also consume more energy under conventional reaction modes. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures to reduce energy consumption. Innovative catalyst design strategies include the use of CoSn/NC as a microwave catalyst, where cobalt serves as the active site, tin acts as a promoter to reduce deactivation by coking, and carbon nitride phase supports the catalyst.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，已经开发了丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术。基于Cr6和Pt的传统PDH催化剂存在成本、稀缺性、毒性以及长期结焦和裂解的问题。这些催化剂在传统反应模式下消耗更多能量。为了解决这些挑战，研究人员正在开发在较低温度下运行的新PDH方法，以降低能耗。创新的催化剂设计策略包括使用CoSn/NC作为微波催化剂，其中钴作为活性位点，锡作为促进剂以减少因结焦导致的失活，碳氮化物相支持催化剂。
