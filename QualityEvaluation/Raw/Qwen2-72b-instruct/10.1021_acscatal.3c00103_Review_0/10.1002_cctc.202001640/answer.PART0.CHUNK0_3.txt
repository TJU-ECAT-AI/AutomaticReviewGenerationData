[1] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[2] "Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption."
[3] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, and detrimental effects, and are prone to coking and cracking over time. Moreover, the conventional reaction mode (CRM) for direct propane dehydrogenation consumes a significant amount of energy. To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to achieve direct propane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption. A novel approach using a non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a microwave catalyst in the microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM) has been developed for the first time, opening a new route for the high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at low temperatures.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，人们正在开发丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术。基于Cr6和Pt的传统PDH催化剂存在成本、稀缺性和有害影响的问题，并且容易在长时间内发生焦化和裂解。此外，直接丙烷脱氢的常规反应模式（CRM）消耗大量能量。为了解决这些挑战，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以在较低温度下实现直接丙烷脱氢，从而降低能耗。首次开发了一种使用非贵金属CoSn/NC催化剂作为微波催化剂的新型方法，在微波催化反应模式（MCRM）下，为在低温下高效利用丰富的丙烷资源开辟了新途径。
