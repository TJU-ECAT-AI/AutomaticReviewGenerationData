[1] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[2] "Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption."
[3] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, and detrimental effects, and they suffer from coking and cracking over time. Moreover, the conventional reaction mode (CRM) for PDH consumes a significant amount of energy. To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to create new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures, thereby reducing energy consumption. A novel approach has been developed using a non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a microwave catalyst for PDH under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This opens a new route for the high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at low temperatures.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术得到了发展。基于Cr6和Pt的传统PDH催化剂存在成本、稀缺性和有害影响的问题，并且随着时间的推移会出现焦化和裂解。此外，PDH的常规反应模式（CRM）消耗大量能源。为了解决这些挑战，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以创建在较低温度下运行的新PDH方法，从而降低能源消耗。已经开发了一种新颖的方法，使用非贵金属CoSn/NC催化剂作为PDH的微波催化剂，在微波催化反应模式（MCRM）下。这为在低温下高效利用丰富的丙烷资源开辟了一条新途径。
