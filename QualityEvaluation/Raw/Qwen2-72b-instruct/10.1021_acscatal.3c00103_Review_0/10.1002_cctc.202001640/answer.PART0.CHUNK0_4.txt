[1] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."
[2] "Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption."
[3] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption is highly desired. A novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM) has been developed, which uses non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, opening a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术得到了发展。然而，基于Cr6和Pt的直接PDH催化剂的最佳催化性能要么成本高昂，要么稀缺，要么有害，并且长期受到焦化和裂解的困扰。此外，直接丙烷脱氢反应在常规反应模式（CRM）下具有更高的能耗。为了应对这些挑战，迫切需要开发一种在低温下进行的新型直接丙烷脱氢方法，以降低能耗。已经开发出一种在低温下进行直接丙烷脱氢反应的新方法，即在微波催化反应模式（MCRM）下进行，首次使用非贵金属CoSn/NC催化剂作为新型微波催化剂在丙烷直接脱氢反应中，为在低温下高效利用丰富的C3H8资源开辟了新途径。
