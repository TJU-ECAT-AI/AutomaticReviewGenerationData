Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising alternative for propylene production, driven by escalating industrial demand and the imperative to adapt to changing global energy landscapes. Traditionally, propylene was a byproduct of oil refining, but as crude oil becomes more complex and refining yields decrease, PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to this critical petrochemical. However, the process is not without challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and sintering. Innovative design strategies are being developed to address these issues, focusing on enhancing catalyst stability and recyclability. Researchers are exploring novel materials and morphologies that can resist deactivation, such as bimetallic catalysts and hierarchical porous structures, which can improve the dispersion of active sites and facilitate coke removal. Additionally, in situ regeneration techniques are being optimized to maintain catalyst activity over extended periods, reducing the need for frequent replacements and lowering operational costs. These advancements not only improve the efficiency and economics of PDH but also contribute to a more sustainable petrochemical industry, aligning with global efforts to reduce carbon footprints and optimize resource utilization.
