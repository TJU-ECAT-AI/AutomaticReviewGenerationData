1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes? The literature does not provide specific information on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques or catalyst design strategies for PDH processes. However, it does discuss the challenges and progress in the activation of CH bonds in light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane, which is a fundamental step in PDH. Theoretical studies using density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling have provided insights into the mechanisms of CH bond activation and the design of efficient catalysts to promote the transformation of light alkanes into value-added products. These studies have elucidated the active sites, reaction pathways, and electronic features of the conversion processes, with a focus on suppressing side reactions and coke formation. The design of new catalysts and improvement of existing ones are reviewed based on the fundamental understanding and theory-driven catalyst design. This approach can be extended to PDH processes to address the challenges of deactivation, stability, and recyclability by developing catalysts with optimized electronic and geometric properties that enhance the selectivity and efficiency of propane conversion while minimizing the formation of coke and other deactivating species.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何应对这些挑战，以及在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中，为克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发哪些创新的催化剂设计策略？文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术或PDH过程催化剂设计策略的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了在轻烷烃，如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷的CH键激活方面的挑战和进展，这是PDH的基本步骤。使用密度泛函理论(DFT)和微动力学建模的理论研究为CH键激活的机制和促进轻烷烃转化为高价值产品的高效催化剂的设计提供了见解。这些研究阐明了活性位点、反应途径和转化过程的电子特征，重点是抑制副反应和焦炭形成。根据基本理解和理论驱动的催化剂设计，对新催化剂的设计和现有催化剂的改进进行了回顾。这种方法可以扩展到PDH过程中，通过开发具有优化电子和几何性质的催化剂，以增强丙烷转化的选择性和效率，同时最大限度地减少焦炭和其他失活物种的形成，从而应对失活、稳定性和可回收性的挑战。
