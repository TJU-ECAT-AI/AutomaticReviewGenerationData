1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes? The literature does not provide specific information on propane dehydrogenation techniques or catalyst design strategies for PDH processes. However, it does discuss the challenges and progress in the activation of CH bonds in light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane, which is relevant to PDH. Theoretical studies using density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling have provided insights into the mechanisms of CH bond activation and the design of efficient catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes. These studies have elucidated the active sites, reaction pathways, and electronic features of the conversion processes, which can guide the development of catalysts with improved stability and recyclability for PDH.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何应对这些挑战，以及在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中，为克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发哪些创新的催化剂设计策略？文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢技术或PDH过程催化剂设计策略的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了在轻烷烃，如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷的CH键激活方面的挑战和进展，这与PDH相关。使用密度泛函理论(DFT)和微动力学建模的理论研究为CH键激活的机制和轻烷烃转化的高效催化剂设计提供了见解。这些研究阐明了转化过程的活性位点、反应途径和电子特性，可以指导PDH催化剂的开发，以提高稳定性和可回收性。
