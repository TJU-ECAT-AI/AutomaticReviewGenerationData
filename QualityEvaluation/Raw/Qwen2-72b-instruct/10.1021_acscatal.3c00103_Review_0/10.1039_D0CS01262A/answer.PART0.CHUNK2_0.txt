[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

1.Increasing global demand for propylene, driven by the shale gas revolution and expected to reach 130 million metric tons by 2023, has led to the exploration of on-purpose propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH, an endothermic process, is catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically operating at around 600 C. Pt-based catalysts, while highly active, face challenges such as poor propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation, and instability due to coke formation and sintering at high temperatures. Efforts to enhance Pt-based catalysts include doping with late transition metals (TMs) and main-group metals like Ga and Sn, as well as modifying supports. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) follows the MVK mechanism, involving the reaction of reducing reactants with surface oxygen atoms to create oxygen vacancies, which can be refilled by O2 or CO2 adsorption. To overcome thermodynamic limitations, an oxidant is added to react with hydrogen or H2, releasing heat. However, ODH requires lower temperatures to prevent overoxidation to CO and CO2 and achieve higher selectivity. PDH is a kinetically controlled reaction, with CH bond activation being a rate-determining step that necessitates higher temperatures. The reaction mechanisms and pathways on catalysts in PDH and ODH systems are not fully understood, and side reactions like deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation must be considered.

1.全球对丙烯的需求不断增长，受页岩气革命的推动，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿吨，这促使人们探索丙烯的定向生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH是一种吸热过程，由Pt和Cr基催化剂催化，通常在约600°C的温度下运行。虽然Pt基催化剂活性高，但它们面临着丙烯选择性差、快速失活和由于高温下焦炭形成和烧结导致的不稳定性等问题。为了增强Pt基催化剂，人们采取了诸如掺杂晚期过渡金属（TMs）和主族金属如镓（Ga）和锡（Sn），以及修改载体等措施。丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）遵循MVK机制，涉及还原反应物与表面氧原子的反应，以产生氧空位，这些空位可以通过O2或CO2的吸附来重新填充。为了克服热力学限制，向反应物或系统中添加氧化剂与氢或H2反应，释放大量热量。然而，对于丙烷的ODH，为了防止过度氧化为CO和CO2并获得更高的选择性，反应必须在较低的温度下进行。PDH是一种动力学控制的反应，丙烷中CH键的活化通常是决定速率的步骤，这需要在较高的温度下进行反应。PDH和ODH系统中催化剂上的反应机制和途径的性质仍然难以捉摸，必须考虑许多副反应，如深度脱氢、CC键断裂、H迁移和H2O的形成。
