[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, with Pt-based catalysts being commonly used due to their high catalytic activity. However, these catalysts suffer from issues such as unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability caused by coke formation and sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these challenges, researchers have focused on improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts through doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, as well as modifying carriers. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) follows the MVK mechanism, which involves the reaction of reducing reactants with highly reactive oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and form oxygen vacancies. This mechanism allows for the formation of a catalytic cycle through the adsorption of O2 or CO2 at the oxygen vacancy sites. To break the thermodynamic limitations of the PDH reaction, an oxidant can be added to react with hydrogen or H2, producing water and releasing heat. However, for ODH of propane, the reaction must be carried out at a lower temperature to avoid the overoxidation of products to CO and CO2 and to achieve higher selectivity. PDH is a kinetically controlled reaction, with the activation of the CH bond in propane being a rate-determining step that requires higher temperatures. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to address these challenges and improve the efficiency and recyclability of PDH processes.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术作为一种有前途的替代方案得到了发展。PDH是一种吸热反应，可以通过Pt和Cr基催化剂催化，其中Pt基催化剂由于其高催化活性而被广泛使用。然而，这些催化剂存在丙烯选择性不佳、快速失活和由于在高温下形成焦炭和烧结导致的稳定性差等问题。为了克服这些挑战，研究人员专注于通过掺杂额外的促进剂，如晚期过渡金属和主族金属，以及修改载体，来提高Pt基催化剂的性能。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）遵循MVK机制，该机制涉及还原反应物与催化剂表面的高活性氧原子反应，生成氧化产物并形成氧空位。这种机制允许通过在氧空位位点吸附O2或CO2形成催化循环。为了打破PDH反应的热力学限制，可以添加氧化剂与氢或H2反应，产生水并释放热量。然而，对于丙烷的ODH，为了防止产物过度氧化为CO和CO2并获得更高的选择性，反应必须在较低的温度下进行。PDH是一种动力学控制反应，丙烷中CH键的活化通常是一个速率决定步骤，需要更高的温度。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以解决这些挑战并提高PDH过程的效率和可回收性。
