1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene from propane. PDH processes, both oxidative and nonoxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of bifunctional catalysts, metal-oxide interfaces, and supported metal nanoparticles, are being explored to improve the selectivity and efficiency of PDH reactions. These strategies aim to control the reaction pathways, minimize coke formation, and facilitate the regeneration of catalysts, thereby increasing the overall yield of propylene and reducing the environmental impact of the process.
