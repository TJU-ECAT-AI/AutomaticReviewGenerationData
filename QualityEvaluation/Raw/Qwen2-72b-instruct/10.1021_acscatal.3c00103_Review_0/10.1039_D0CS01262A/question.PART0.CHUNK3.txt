Dependence of activity and selectivity on the cluster size and valence state The selectivity of propylene remains a challenge in ODH of propane. A study of deep oxidation of propane to CO2 on V2O5(001)424 revealed that the terminal VO sites are the active sites for the formation of acetone from i-propoxide and the further combustion of acetone to CO2. The VOsupport is the main active site for propylene formation. It provides a guideline for the rational design of new catalysts with improved selectivity. The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design. Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity, while polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio could lower the propylene selectivity. The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers.413 Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period (see Fig. 36d).404 Over Î³-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period. With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation. Note that the PDH ability should be related to their corresponding valence state.420,425 It has been illustrated that the oxygen vacancy modified the electronic structure of active species and even change the reaction mechanism.426 Gas-phase O2 in the reactant mixture reoxidizes the reduced V species and removes carbon deposits. The lattice O of VOx species provides pathways toward desired propylene formation, while the surface O mainly forms undesired COx species. Propane conversion and the propylene yield could be described by a kinetic model including propane ODH, parallel propane combustion, and sequential propylene combustion. Propylene is the most abundant primary product. CO and CO2 are formed by the secondary combustion of propylene, which is the main source of carbon oxides in the studied reaction, and CO2 also forms by direct combustion of propane.335,427,428 The activation energies of CO and CO2 formation from secondary propylene combustion are less than the activation energy for propylene formation on TiO2/SiO2-supported VOx catalysts, leading to the inverse conversion versus selectivity relationship.429 This result is different from the energy profiles for propane ODH and propylene combustion over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 37.15 The CH bond activation and the recombination of the remaining OH groups to form H2O are irreversible.427,428 For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.409 The rate of propane ODH reaction is proportional to C3H8 partial pressure and independent of O2 partial pressure in the limit of very low H2O concentrations, and therefore propane activation is a kinetically relevant step. However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations. On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.427 Fig. 37 Energy profile for propane ODH (left) and rate determining step of propene combustion over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.15 Reproduced from ref. 15 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2014.
In addition to these studies, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst. Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts; the effect is explained by a modification of the acidbase properties of the catalysts.335,430432 On VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the potassium additive by blocking active centers on the catalyst surface exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion and has a lower influence on ethylene and ethane combustion.335 Thus, potassium does not change the ethylene selectivity but has a distinct influence on the propylene selectivity, and thus leads to high initial selectivity (95%). Zhao et al.433 also reported that OH groups on supported VOx catalysts can lead to lower PDH activity and less coke formation by combined experimental and calculational studies, but the fresh VOx catalysts under a C3H8 atmosphere are directly reduced to V2O3.
4.2.3 Other catalysts Other types of catalysts, such as Cr-based catalysts, Ga-based catalysts, Mo-based catalysts, and mixed metal oxides, have also been studied in the ODH of propane, and these catalysts generally permit the redox mechanism to occur without structural collapse.72,393 However, most of these studies mainly involve experimental findings due to the complexity of the metal oxides, including the different crystal structures, the oxidation states, and the surface facets.337,338,434437 Liu et al.402 studied PDH on perfect Ga2O3(100) by DFT calculations. The bridge-bound surface O sites are active for cleaving the CH bonds in propane, and thus rather stable OH groups are formed on the surface. The initial CH bond activation of propane energetically prefers the radical mechanism and shows a rather low energy barrier (0.78 eV) at the surface O sites. Propylene can be formed through H abstraction from physically adsorbed propyl radicals or from propoxide and propylgallium intermediates. Besides, propylene at the surface O sites has high adsorption energy, which tends to be further dehydrogenated or oligomerized, leading to catalyst deactivation. Once the surface O ions are blocked or consumed by the H atoms, the Ga sites will become the main reaction sites to catalyze the further dehydrogenation reactions and H abstraction by Ga sites needs to overcome high energy barriers to form gallium hydrides (GaH). However, the formation of H2 from the GaH and OH groups is much easier. Therefore, the RDS changes from H abstraction by oxygen sites at the initial reaction stage to H abstraction by Ga sites from various propyl sources to form GaH. On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O. Since it is also possible to generate gaseous H2O at high temperatures, the reaction would follow an ODH mechanism comprising H2O at the initial stage and follow a PDH mechanism forming H2 at the steady stage.
Fu et al.400 also reported that the initial propane activation on molybdenum oxides follows the same ODH mechanism as V-based catalysts in that lattice oxygens participate the CH activation, where 6 possible mechanisms of the CH bond activation on metal oxides are considered on Mo3O9, leading to 17 transition states involving CH activations from the methyl and methylene groups in propane. For example, this activation step can specifically take place at MO ion pairs by a heterolytic mechanism or at OO pairs by a homolytic mechanism or at the terminal MO site by an oxygen insertion mechanism. On the surface, it is found that the most feasible reaction pathway for the initial propane activation is H abstraction by the terminal MoO site and the CH activation for methylene is 0.20 eV more favorable than that for the methyl CH bond. The calculated activation enthalpy and entropy for the methylene CH bond are 32.3 kcal mol1 and 28.6 cal (mol K1)1, respectively.
Also, for MoOx catalysts, similar active centers are present on supported MoOx, MoO3, and ZrMo2O8.428 Surface O and OH groups are the most abundant surface intermediates that can lead to a rate expression to accurately describe the measured kinetics of propane ODH.427,428 On MoOx and VOx catalysts, similar kinetic rate expressions confirm that propane ODH occurs via similar pathways, using lattice oxygen atoms to abstract hydrogen atoms from propane in the RDS of irreversible CH bond activation.339 For the transition state for this elementary step, the electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal centers as an i-propoxide and an OH group from propane.438 Propane ODH activation energies (1.031.31 eV) are higher than those for propylene combustion (0.530.67 eV), where the measured difference in activation energy (0.500.63 eV) between the both is larger than the difference in the weakest CH bond dissociation enthalpy between propane and propylene (0.42 eV).The activation energies for propane primary dehydrogenation and propylene secondary combustion increase as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+), while the corresponding reaction rates decrease. Therefore, metal oxides having high redox properties exhibit high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to higher propylene yields.339 Chen et al. also reported that VOx catalysts are much more active than MoOx catalysts with similar H2 reduction rates.438 Zhu et al.358,391,405,439 systematically studied the catalytic performance of PDH on Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O3. There are oxygen vacancies that can exist on the ZnO surfaces, also implying that the reaction path of the ODH mechanism could occur in the initial reaction stage.405 Besides, oxygen vacancies may modify their electronic structure, thereby positively affecting the reactivity of Î±-Cr2O3, but negatively affecting ZnO mainly due to the weaker Lewis acidbase interaction on ZnO(1010). Therefore, for the dehydrogenation reaction over some transition metal oxides without oxidants (such as O2 and CO2) introduced into the reaction gas mixture, active lattice oxygen can participate in the CH bond activation, possibly following an ODH mechanism in the initial stage of the reaction before the oxide surfaces reach a steady state. However, if oxidants are introduced into the reaction gas, the dehydrogenation reaction could follow the ODH mechanism to remove the H atoms absorbed on the surface.337,440,441 For example, Atanga et al.442 proposed that CO2 as a mild oxidant for the ODH of propane can reactivate deactivated redox catalysts caused by metal oxide reduction, and the introduction of CO2 can also overcome the problems of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity.
4.3 CH activation on single atomoxide hybrids
Single-atom catalysis is an area of intense current research.443445 On the one hand, single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit properties that are distinctly different from those of supported nanoclusters. On the other hand, single-atom catalysts have well-defined local structures, and therefore provide an opportunity for establishing the structurereactivity relationship.446448 However, because of the low coordination environment, the surfaces of SACs have a high surface free energy, and single atoms tend to migrate and aggregate to form clusters. Recently, several research efforts have been devoted to synthesizing thermally stable SACs, such as the proposal of strong metalsupport interactions (SMSI), which can play a role in keeping single atoms from sintering on the surface.446,449 Lang et al. found that isolated Pt atoms or PtO2 units can be trapped on an Fe2O3 support through SMSI during high-temperature calcination (800 C, 5 h).450 Single metal atoms have been deposited onto transition metal, graphene, and metal oxides, among which singly dispersed metal atoms on metal oxides have received much attention in catalyzing PDH.364,385,451455 As has been observed by Xiong et al.,451 isolated single atoms of Pt can be steadily trapped on CeO2 catalysts, while the catalyst is not selective towards propylene. DFT calculations show that the strongly adsorbed propylene is expected to undergo further reactions, leading eventually to CC bond cleavage. To prevent a further reaction, Sn is added to the Pt single-atom catalyst. They found that propylene showed much lower adsorption energy on small PtSn clusters than that on single Pt atoms. Consequently, a higher selectivity is obtained on PtSnCeO2. Sun et al.385 directly dispersed single Pt atoms on Cu NPs to form SAA catalysts, which exhibit high propylene selectivity (90%) and great stability at 520 C. In addition to the use of SAA catalysts, other SACs that provide excellent catalytic performance for PDH are still under theoretical research.
Some supports have been considered to anchor single metal atoms by theoretical calculations.358,391,405,439 For instance, Pt1Cr2O3(0001) and Pt1ZnO(1010) oxides were constructed by Chang et al.,405 and show higher activity than their pristine surfaces by lowering the activation energy for the RDS and promoting H2 desorption, and on these two types of oxide surfaces single Pt atoms act as promoters (see Fig. 38). These findings are in line with experimental and DFT studies by Liu et al. and Sattler et al.,333,456 which clearly showed that the addition of a trace amount of Pt could accelerate H2 desorption over ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and affect the distribution of Ga3+, thereby leading to a higher activity than the pristine surfaces.2,456 This may be attributed to the interactions between Pt and ZnO (or TiO2). On the Pt1Ga2O3(100) surface, a Pt-doped Ga2O3 catalyst shows a bifunctional character in PDH where the PtO site brings about dehydrogenation, while the GaO site is active for desorbing H2.439 Fig. 38 Energy profiles for PDH on pristine, oxygen-deficient, and Pt-doped (a) Cr2O3 and (b) ZnO surfaces. All the potential energies are referenced to gas-phase propane.405 Reproduced from ref. 405 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2019.
The kinetics of the PDH reaction over M1V2O3 (M = MnCu, RuAg, and OsAu) were studied by Zhang et al.391 In their model, surface V and O atoms are replaced with single atoms, including M1(Vvac)V2O3(0001) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and M1(Ovac)V2O3(0001) (M = Pd, Pt, and Au). Moreover, it shows that the VO(o) site is the dominant active site over V2O3(0001). These findings agree well with the experimental studies by Liu et al. who found that V3+ was more active for PDH over VOx/Al2O3, which, to some extent, explains why a VOx catalyst without H2 reduction shows higher initial activity.394 Besides, on M1(Vvac)V2O3(0001), the active site for PDH is VO(o) and M acts as the promoter, while on M1(Ovac)V2O3(0001) the M and V ion pairs act as the active site. Apart from the work by Zhang et al., Ma et al. systemically examined the structural stability, catalytic activity and selectivity of 13 M1ZnO (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au).358 By applying linear scaling relations of chemisorption energy and transition-state energy, it is found that the formation energies of H and 2-propyl can be used to measure the binding strengths of all the reaction intermediates and activated complexes and can therefore be used as descriptors to describe the kinetics of PDH over M1ZnO. As indicated in Fig. 39, theoretical calculations predict that most of the single-atom-doped ZnO catalysts except for Fe- and Os-doped ZnO exhibit higher activity than pristine ZnO. Such a study can not only offer new opportunities to develop a more cost-effective heterogeneous catalyst but also help guide future experiments.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
The paper reviews the computational catalysis of the CH bond activation of light alkanes such as methane, ethane, and propane towards synthesis gas and light olefins, as the important building blocks of the chemical industry. Quantum chemical calculations have grown into a technique of extraordinary power that pervades all current discussions of heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, computational approaches that use results from DFT calculations combined with descriptor-based scaling relationships as inputs to microkinetic analysis or kinetic Monte Carlo simulations not only play a significant role in developing a step-by-step, molecular-level view of the pathway leading to products but also provide an effective way to rationally screen potential catalyst candidates for a given catalytic reaction. A highly integrated approach using DFT, linear scaling relations, and microkinetic modeling successfully accounts for the way catalyst compositions like various metals, alloys, single atoms, metaloxide interfaces, and locally coordinated oxygen in oxides modify the electronic properties of the active sites and their relations to the catalytic performance of alkane conversion. DFT-based microkinetic analysis extends the computational catalysis from model surfaces to industrially relevant catalysts. In this review, we attempted to illustrate the recent substantial progress made by using such theoretical methods in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of CH bonds of light alkanes and in the discovery of new and more effective catalysts for light alkane conversion on metal and metal oxides. Special efforts have been devoted to recognizing the patterns of catalytic activity and selectivity for a class of substances applied in commercially important reactions.
Despite the fact that many different reactions and different types of catalysts have been applied to convert light alkanes to valuable products, it is common that the light alkane transformation initiates from CH cleavage. The CH bond activation of methane, ethane, and propane on metal and metal oxides was summarized and compared. A universal scaling relationship of CH bond activation across C1C3 alkanes and various catalysts was discussed.
Some mechanistic insights into methane conversion to synthesis gas are common for steam reforming, dry reforming and partial oxidation, involving CH bond cleavage to form CHx followed by subsequent oxidation of CH* or C* by O* or OH*. The preferred reaction pathways and rate-determining step depend on the catalysts and operating conditions. DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling provide a guideline to manipulate the catalyst surface to reduce the carbon formation by lowering the surface carbon coverage. The lowered surface carbon coverage benefits from the enhanced CH* oxidation and the reduced CH* formation and its decomposition to surface carbon.
The critical challenges in ethane and propane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation are the selectivities to olefins and coke formation. The DFT calculations and kinetic analysis unravel useful fundamental insights into these key challenges at the molecular level, where the difference in the desorption energy of olefins and the activation energy of deep dehydrogenation of surface intermediates is used as the descriptor. Computational catalysis suggested Pt-based alloys as the best candidates for industrial catalysts by lowering the olefin desorption energy.Oxidative dehydrogenation on oxides is an attractive alternative for light alkane dehydrogenation to olefins due to the breaking of the thermodynamic limitation and in situ supply of heat for highly endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. However, the critical challenge in olefin selectivity still remains due to the high reactivity of olefins. DFT calculations elucidated the active sites and surface reactions responsible for the formation of olefins, COx, and other byproducts. The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy. However, it also provides huge opportunities to tune the oxygen activity to reduce the CC bond cleavage and oxidation to COx. Oxides are a large family and present numerous oxide structures. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed the catalyst's activity dependence on the oxide identity, doping, cluster size, and supports. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy or hydrogen affinity was identified as the descriptor to describe the oxygen activity. However, a thorough screening of a huge number of oxide structures to find appropriate catalyst candidates for a given reaction remains a formidable challenge. Most of the studies have been performed only addressing the CH bond activation. DFT calculations of elementary steps involved in the whole catalytic cycle, including by-product formation, are essential to address the selectivity. In addition, the active sites are highly dynamic on oxides due to their redox nature, with generation and filling of the oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy in the steady-state can be changed with reaction conditions. Full modeling of reactions accounting for active site dynamics is also extremely challenging. Better scaling relationships for adsorption energy and activation energy on oxides need to be explored based on a big dataset. Machine learning and artificial intelligence could be explored to significantly accelerate catalyst development.There is generally a strongly constrained relation between the CH bond activation of light paraffins, olefin desorption, and deep CH bond activation, which presents a challenge in catalyst design to maintain high activity, selectivity, and stability with a high coking resistance, simultaneously. The alloy of Pt with a second metal and a coreshell structure is an effective way to lower the ethylene and propylene desorption energy and increase the olefin selectivity and lower the coking potential, but at the expense of lower activity. The single metal or metal clusters on oxides could be explored to break down the constrained relation to enhance the catalytic performance. However, the active sites at the metaloxide interface largely increase the complexity of the modeling. There are much more possible sites for adsorption and elementary reactions compared to the metal and oxide alone.There remain several challenges in theoretical catalysis, which makes it difficult to discuss the chemistry of light alkane conversion in a more quantitative way. First, DFT has its complexity and a lot of physics hidden inside the approximate exchangecorrelation functional. This term works surprisingly well given its simplicity and holds the key to the success of the theory. However, it is still challenging to quantitatively reproduce the reaction rates obtained from experiments, since the values of the calculated reaction heat and activation energy obtained by DFT calculations have an uncertainty of 0.10.2 eV.457,458 Second, the structure of active sites on catalysts is generally represented by simple low-index surfaces in computational studies. A gap still exists between realistic catalysts under reaction conditions and model surfaces. In situ characterization of working catalysts can provide more detailed structural information to help build more reliable structures close to industrial catalysts. Even though computational modeling of the surface structure of industrial catalysts needs to be carried out with caution, there is no doubt that DFT calculations are able to suggest mechanisms and structureactivityselectivity relations, and rationalize a considerable amount of experimental observations, which are often difficult to understand. Finally, the microkinetic analysis of reactions is necessary to present the experimental conditions appropriately to understand important industrial reactions. The DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling need to be even more tightly associated with multiscale modeling at catalyst pellet and reactor levels, as well as the experimental study for searching for new catalysts and improving industrial catalysts.Despite many challenges, with advances in density functional theory, scaling relationships, and descriptor-based microkinetic modeling, it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favorably with experiments.28 The computational approach has become an effective tool for the design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability. It is interesting to note that the advanced computational catalysis approach has predicted the most active pure metals for methane and propane activation, and some bimetallic alloys are screened based on the volcano curve obtained from pure metals for ethane activation. The highly integrated computational and experimental approach will be explored to accelerate the development of next-generation catalysts for alkane conversion.
