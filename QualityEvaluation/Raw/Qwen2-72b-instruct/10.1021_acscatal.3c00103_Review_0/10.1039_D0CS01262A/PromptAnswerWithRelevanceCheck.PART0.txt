1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, PDH techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts using alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. The design of new catalysts with improved selectivity is guided by the understanding that the ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter. Sub-monolayer VOx catalysts can provide a high propylene yield by compromising between activity and selectivity. The use of metal oxides with high redox properties and less acidic metal oxides is also being explored to achieve higher catalytic activity and propylene yields, respectively. The introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant can reactivate deactivated redox catalysts and overcome the problems of over-oxidation and low propylene selectivity. The development of thermally stable single-atom catalysts (SACs) and the use of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) to prevent single atoms from sintering on the surface are also being investigated. Theoretical studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling are providing insights into the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds of light alkanes and the discovery of new and more effective catalysts for light alkane conversion.

1.Increasing global demand for propylene, driven by the shale gas revolution and expected to reach 130 million metric tons by 2023, has led to the exploration of on-purpose propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH, an endothermic process, is catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically operating at around 600 C. Pt-based catalysts, while highly active, face challenges such as poor propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation, and instability due to coke formation and sintering at high temperatures. Efforts to enhance Pt-based catalysts include doping with late transition metals (TMs) and main-group metals like Ga and Sn, as well as modifying supports. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) follows the MVK mechanism, involving the reaction of reducing reactants with surface oxygen atoms to create oxygen vacancies, which can be refilled by O2 or CO2 adsorption. To overcome thermodynamic limitations, an oxidant is added to react with hydrogen or H2, releasing heat. However, ODH requires lower temperatures to prevent overoxidation to CO and CO2 and achieve higher selectivity. PDH is a kinetically controlled reaction, with CH bond activation being a rate-determining step that necessitates higher temperatures. The reaction mechanisms and pathways on catalysts in PDH and ODH systems are not fully understood, and side reactions like deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation must be considered.

1.全球对丙烯的需求不断增长，受页岩气革命的推动，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿吨，这促使人们探索丙烯的定向生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH是一种吸热过程，由Pt和Cr基催化剂催化，通常在约600°C的温度下运行。虽然Pt基催化剂活性高，但它们面临着丙烯选择性差、快速失活和由于高温下焦炭形成和烧结导致的不稳定性等问题。为了增强Pt基催化剂，人们采取了诸如掺杂晚期过渡金属（TMs）和主族金属如镓（Ga）和锡（Sn），以及修改载体等措施。丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）遵循MVK机制，涉及还原反应物与表面氧原子的反应，以产生氧空位，这些空位可以通过O2或CO2的吸附来重新填充。为了克服热力学限制，向反应物或系统中添加氧化剂与氢或H2反应，释放大量热量。然而，对于丙烷的ODH，为了防止过度氧化为CO和CO2并获得更高的选择性，反应必须在较低的温度下进行。PDH是一种动力学控制的反应，丙烷中CH键的活化通常是决定速率的步骤，这需要在较高的温度下进行反应。PDH和ODH系统中催化剂上的反应机制和途径的性质仍然难以捉摸，必须考虑许多副反应，如深度脱氢、CC键断裂、H迁移和H2O的形成。

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route to produce propylene from propane. PDH processes can be either oxidative or nonoxidative. In oxidative PDH, propane is converted to propylene and water in the presence of a catalyst and oxygen. In nonoxidative PDH, propane is directly dehydrogenated to propylene without the need for oxygen. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of bimetallic catalysts, the incorporation of promoters, and the development of novel catalyst supports. Bimetallic catalysts can improve the selectivity and stability of the PDH process by providing multiple active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Promoters can enhance the activity and stability of the catalyst by modifying the electronic properties of the active metal. Novel catalyst supports can improve the recyclability of the catalyst by providing a stable and reusable platform for the active metal. These strategies are being developed to improve the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes and to meet the increasing industrial demand for propylene.

These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts using alkali metal additives, and the tuning of oxygen activity on metal oxides to reduce deep dehydrogenation and oxidation to COx.

The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield. The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and the PDH ability should be related to their corresponding valence state. The lattice oxygen is the main active site, and it significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy. However, it also provides huge opportunities to tune the oxygen activity to reduce the CC bond cleavage and oxidation to COx.

Propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, requiring the reaction at a higher temperature. Currently, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts in PDH and ODH systems remains elusive, and many side reactions, such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation, need to be taken into consideration.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术作为一种有前途的替代方案得到了发展。PDH是一种吸热反应，可以通过Pt-和Cr基催化剂催化，通常在约600 C的Al2O3支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂上进行。然而，Pt基催化剂由于在高温下形成焦炭和催化剂烧结，导致丙烯选择性不佳、快速失活和稳定性差。为了解决这些问题，研究人员正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，例如用晚期过渡金属和主族金属（包括Ga和Sn）作为额外的促进剂进行掺杂，以及修改载体。丙烷氧化脱氢通常遵循MVK机制，涉及还原反应物与催化剂表面高度反应性的氧原子反应，生成氧化产物并形成氧空位。向反应进料或系统中添加氧化剂可以帮助打破丙烷脱氢反应的热力学限制，通过与中间物种氢或产物H2反应生成水并释放热量。然而，对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，反应产物容易被氧化生成CO和CO2，因此为了获得更高的选择性，反应必须在较低的温度下进行。丙烷脱氢是一种动力学控制反应，丙烷中CH键的活化通常是速率决定步骤，需要在较高温度下进行反应。目前，PDH和ODH系统中催化剂上的反应机理和反应途径的本质仍然难以捉摸，许多副反应，如深度脱氢、CC键断裂、H迁移和H2O生成，也需要考虑。

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, PDH techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, how do propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges, and what innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes? The literature does not provide specific information on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques or catalyst design strategies for PDH processes. However, it does discuss the challenges and progress in the activation of CH bonds in light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane, which is a fundamental step in PDH and other alkane conversion processes. Theoretical studies using density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling have provided insights into the mechanisms of CH bond activation and the factors governing selectivity and carbon formation. These studies have led to the development of descriptors for predicting the reactivity of different catalyst surfaces and the identification of active sites and reaction pathways. Innovative catalyst design strategies may involve the use of these descriptors to optimize catalysts for PDH, such as selecting metals with appropriate d-band centers or designing bimetallic catalysts with synergistic effects to enhance stability and recyclability. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide hybrid catalysts and the control of nanoparticle size and shape may also be explored to improve the performance of PDH catalysts.

These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts using alkali metal additives, and the tuning of oxygen activity on metal oxides to reduce CC bond cleavage and oxidation to COx. The design of new catalysts with improved selectivity involves compromising cluster size between activity and selectivity, with sub-monolayer VOx providing a high propylene yield. The ratio of terminal VO to other oxygen sites is a key parameter in catalyst design, with small cluster VOx increasing propylene selectivity at the expense of activity, while polymeric VOx decreases selectivity. The use of SACs on metal oxides has received much attention in catalyzing PDH, with single metal atoms deposited onto transition metal, graphene, and metal oxides. The addition of a second metal to Pt-based alloys can lower olefin desorption energy, increase olefin selectivity, and lower coking potential, although at the expense of lower activity. The modification of electronic properties of active sites through the use of various metals, alloys, single atoms, metal-oxide interfaces, and locally coordinated oxygen in oxides can improve the catalytic performance of alkane conversion.
