Ethane ODH pathways on vanadium oxide catalysts were elucidated by kinetic and isotopic tracer and exchange measurements.302 The lack of exchange products (C2H6xDx or C2H4xDx isotopomers) revealed that the first CH bond cleavage in ethane and ethylene was an irreversible and kinetically relevant step in ODH and combustion reactions. 16O218O2C2H6 reactions on supported V16Ox domains led to the initial appearance of 16O from the lattice in the products H2O, CO, and CO2, evidencing the involvement of lattice oxygen in CH bond activation steps. The emerging paradigm is that the development of suitable catalysts requires fundamental insight into the reaction mechanism on a molecular level, including the details of the interactions with the catalytic surfaces and the associated gas-phase reactions. The theoretical calculation has been used to provide a molecular understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms on vanadium-based oxides. Similar activity of oxygen species and reaction mechanisms of CH bond activation have been found on ethane ODH295 as well as propane ODH303 on the V2O5(001) surface. The most favorable pathway occurred on the O(1) (VO) site through a radical mechanism with an activation energy of 1.52 eV;295 VOV was less active toward CH bond activation (1.63 eV) through an oxo-insertion mechanism but much more selective towards ethylene formation. However, the terminal O site exhibited a more favorable side reaction leading to acetaldehyde than to ethylene. The first CH activation step was the RDS, in good agreement with the experimental observation.302 Water and acetaldehyde would desorb from the surface to create vacant O(1) sites easily. The oxygen molecule can re-oxidize the reduced vanadium, which is exothermic by 3.77 eV, with a barrier of 1.52 eV. Obviously, the surface of the catalyst can be re-oxidized easily at high temperatures when it is exposed to O2. A more detailed discussion on the active sites, the reactivity of surface oxygen species, and the reaction mechanism of CH bond activation of light alkanes can be seen in Section 4.2.MoO3 catalysts The surface stability and equilibrium morphology of MoO3 have been investigated by DFT calculations.304 The (010) surface has the lowest surface energy among the surfaces exposed to the gas.304 The ethane ODH mechanism on the MoO3(010) surface was investigated by the first-principles study using the on-site Coulomb correction.294 There are three types of surface oxygens, namely terminal O and symmetric and unsymmetric MoOMo, and the terminal O is the main active site. Two stable configurations of ethylene adsorption on the MoO3(010) surface, namely horizontally and vertically adsorbed ethylenes, were identified. The horizontal adsorption favors ethylene formation with a barrier of 1.36 eV, which is lower than that of V2O5. The vertical adsorption of ethane favors acetaldehyde formation along the α-ODH pathway, and the ethylene oxide formation along the β-ODH pathway. The β-ODH pathway may also produce ethylene from the CH2CH2O intermediate, with the second CH bond activation of ethane as the RDS. Towards horizontal C2H6 ODH reaction (the dominant ethylene formation pathway), the first CH bond activation of ethane is the RDS. This is in agreement with the kinetic study that irrespective of the oxidant's chemical identity (O2, CO2 or H2O), ethane activation occurs via the kinetically relevant CH activation of C2H6 on the lattice O of MoOx, forming ethylene.305 MoVTeNb mixed metal oxides MoVTeNb mixed metal oxides have exhibited high selectivity and yields to C2H4. The catalyst is typically composed of two compounds Mo7.8V1.2Te0.937NbO28.9 and Mo4.31V1.36Te1.81Nb0.33O19.81, which are referred to as M1 and M2 phases, respectively.306 The structure of the M1 phase is illustrated in Fig. 24(a). It is generally accepted that the M1 crystalline phase is responsible for high activity and selectivity due to its ability to catalyze the initial homolytic H abstraction from alkanes.307 Both the basal [001] plane308 and lateral surface309,310 have been reported to be responsible for the activation of alkanes. The S2S4S7 metal positions were proposed as the catalytic centers for alkane activation. The crystal termination of the M1 phase did have an impact on the intrinsic activity of ethane ODH.296 A quantitative correlation was found between the sum of the surface areas of facets (001), (120), and (210) at the surfaces of the M1 crystals and the activity, demonstrating that multiple facets were involved in the reaction. Different facets would have different degrees of exposed active sites, and therefore different catalytic activities. The number of different facets can be tuned by changing the crystal morphology of the M1 phase of MoVTeNbOx catalysts.Fig. 24 (a) Two-dimensional diagram of the MoVTeNbOx M1 unit cell viewed in the [001] direction with 13 cation sites labelled as in the literature.311 Active site centers are composed of metal positions S2S4S7 (red and green), located between unit cells.296 Reproduced from ref. 296 with permission from Wiley-VCH, copyright 2016. (b) Accessibility of surface catalytic sites to reactants on VOx/SiO2 and MoVTeNbO as well as C2H6/C6H12 rate ratios on MoVTeNbO relative to the corresponding values on VOx/SiO2. (c) vdW-DF2 derived electronic energies and (d) structures of transition states for C2H6 ODH (TS1, TS2), parallel O-insertion in C2H5 (TS3) and sequential O-insertion in C2H4 (TS4) at O-atoms exposed in heptagonal pores of double-layer MoVTeNbO.312 Reproduced from ref. 312 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2018.In addition to the surface reaction, C2H6 ODH can also occur on M1 phase MoVTeNb mixed oxides micropores, which was considered to be the reason for the high ethylene yields at moderate temperatures.312,313 Deshlahra and co-workers312 assessed the role of the M1 phase heptagonal channel micropores in regulating reactivity and selectivity using reactant size-dependent kinetic probes and DFT treatments for C2H6 and C6H12 (cyclohexane) activations inside and outside the micropores and compared with nonmicroporous vanadium oxides (VOx/SiO2). As shown in Fig. 24(b), both C2H6 and C6H12 activations can take place on the VOx/SiO2 surface and MoVTeNbO external surfaces. Inside the MoVTeNbO micropores, C2H6 activation is possible due to a tight guesthost fit, while C6H12 cannot access intrapore sites because of the large kinetic diameter. The measured C2H6/C6H12 activation rate ratios on MoVTeNbO were much higher than those measured on VOx/SiO2 and estimated by DFT calculations on the external surfaces, demonstrating that most C2H6 activations on MoVTeNbO occur inside the micropores under typical conditions. MoVTeNbO and VOx/SiO2 exhibited similar product selectivities for C6H12 oxidation, while for C2H6 oxidation, the ethylene selectivity was much higher on the former oxide. This suggested that the external surfaces of MoVTeNbO displayed a similar ability to activate CH bonds and prevent O-insertion in products with VOx/SiO2, but the micropores in MoVTeNbO are more selective for CH activation, which was confirmed by DFT calculations. The DFT calculated electronic energies and structures of transition states for CH activation and O-insertion in C2H6 and C2H4 inside the heptagonal pores of MoVTeNbO are shown in Fig. 24(c) and (d), respectively. C2H6 ODH is the dominant reaction pathway, with the first CH activation as the RDS and ethylene as the product. The CO bond formation via two O-insertion pathways is hindered due to steric hindrances, which require much bulkier CH2 groups in close contact with concave pore walls (top views of TS3 and TS4 in Fig. 24d). Therefore, the heptagonal pores of MoVTeNbO enhance ethylene selectivity by enhancing CH activation and suppressing O-insertion reactions via a combination of van der Waals (vdW) and steric effects.Fig. 25 DFT calculated energy profiles of reforming and ODH of ethane on (a) Pt-terminated CoPt(111) and (b) mixed FeNi(111).323 Reproduced from ref. 323 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2016.The same group investigated lattice O atom coordination effects and pore confinement on selectivity limitations for ethane ODH catalyzed by vanadiumoxo species.313 DFT was used to calculate CH activation and CO formation in ethane ODH on (001) surfaces of V2O5 and MoVTeNb oxides and in pores of MoVTeNb oxides. High C2H4 selectivity depended strongly on the O atom coordination and H atom addition energies of the oxides. CO formation preferably occurred at VO terminal O atoms due to their significantly lower energy than VOV, VOMo bridging or V2OV tri-coordinated O atoms. In contrast, the CH activations on MoVTeNbO(001) surfaces exhibited similar activation energies between bridging O atoms and terminal O atoms. Terminal O atoms are inaccessible in MoVTeNbO bulk oxide micropores, which leads to high ethane activation rates and ethylene selectivity.Co oxides Co3O4 is a good oxidation catalyst. Its high activity has been attributed to the weak metalO bond among other transition metal oxides314 and the easy formation of oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surfaces.315 Co3O4 is also active for ODH. Surface termination can have an impact on the catalyst activity and selectivity of ODH. Experimental and theoretical calculations have identified several stable Co3O4 surfaces, such as (110), (111), and (100). Fung et al. developed a full catalytic cycle of ODH based on first-principles calculations on a thermodynamically stable Co3O4(111) surface.297 The full catalytic cycle includes the first and second CH bond activations, hydroxyl clustering, water formation, water desorption, and lattice oxygen-site regeneration. On the most stable terminal surface, there are two types of lattice oxygen: OA, which is triply coordinated to the subsurface cobalt (Co3+); and OB, which is not only doubly coordinated to the subsurface Co but also singly coordinated to the surface Co. There are also two types of CH activation of ethane, namely the homolytic pathway where the lattice O is the active site, and the heterolytic pathway where the O and Co pair is the active site. The CH activity depends on the lattice oxygen reactivity. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy and Bader charges are good descriptors to predict well the higher reactivity of OA. The first CH activation was more favorable on more reactive lattice oxygen and had a lower barrier for the homolytic pathway (0.62 eV), but the barrier for the second CH activation was lower for the heterolytic pathway. The water formation step of the catalytic cycle on the pure (111) surface was found to be the RDS, possibly due to the highly oxyphilic nature of the Co surface.The same group investigated the effects of Co3O4 doping on oxygen reactivity and ethane CH activation energies over Co3O4(111) and (311) surfaces for a series of dopants.316 The DFT calculations illustrated that the O vacancy formation energy and H adsorption energy were descriptors for oxygen reactivity, which were directly correlated with the ethane CH activation energy and the TS geometry. The group also discovered that the surface orientation had a significant influence on dopant efficacy.Ni oxides The reaction mechanism of ODH of ethane has also been studied on nickel-based oxides, namely Ni3Ox (x = 1, 2, 3) by DFT calculations using the cluster model.298 Ethylnickel species have been identified as main reaction intermediates through a concerted mechanism involving two sites for the CH bond activation step. Subsequent pathways include beta-H elimination, alpha-H abstraction, CC bond cleavage, and isomerization to ethoxide species. The selectivity of ethylene depends on the relative rates of the four pathways. According to the calculation, the SC2H4 selectivity increases from 37% to over 99% with decreasing x value. The oxygen vacancy has a significant influence on the selectivity and more oxygen vacancies in Ni oxides enhance remarkably the ethylene selectivity. An important issue for transition-metal catalyzed oxidation of hydrocarbons is the type of primary species generated from the CH bond activation step and the types of species directly responsible for the initial product selectivity observed in the experiment.14 The adsorbed ethane on oxygen sites forms ethoxide, which leads to ethylene formation. The high selectivity in the Ni3O1 case is due to the absence of a bare O atom nearby the α-Ni site and block isomerization from ethyl-nickel to ethoxide, which is more likely to undergo CC bond cleavage.Doping of NiO with Sn, Ti, and W has been shown to increase the catalytic activity and selectivity.317 DFT calculations show that doping these metals into the NiO structure are thermodynamically feasible. The dopant, on the one hand, can decrease the particle size of NiO and open up more active sites. The incorporation of these metals into the NiO lattice, on the other hand, reduces the number of holes (h+), resulting in a significant decrease of nonstoichiometric oxygen (O) in the NiO structure. The low concentration of nonstoichiometric oxygen contributes to the improved catalytic selectivity (O is known to favor complete ethane oxidation to CO2). Based on this study, a design criterion has been proposed; an optimum concentration of nonstoichiometric oxygen at the NiO surface exists. A too high oxygen concentration leads to total oxidation of ethylene to CO2, while a too low oxygen concentration leads to difficulty in activating ethylene at a lower temperature.Doping of NiO with Nb in ethane ODH was found to form NbO2 groups, considered to be the dopant, predicted by DFT calculations.318 The NbO2 groups were created because the Nb-doped NiO adsorbed oxygen very strongly from the gas phase and dissociated it to generate two chemisorbed O atoms, with each making an NbONi bond. The calculated activation energies of dissociative adsorption of ethane on the NbO2-doped oxide were substantially lower than that on undoped NiO. This is because the NbO2-doped oxide was more reactive in breaking the CH bond of ethane than undoped NiO. However, this is different from the experimental results319,320 in that even adding a small amount of Nb decreased the ethane conversion per unit area and per unit time for NiO catalysts. The difference between the experimental observation and the DFT prediction might be due to the formation of NbOx clusters on the surface or NiNb2O6 (instead of NbO2 groups used in the model) during the calcination in oxygen for catalyst preparation. Experiments found that the slow deactivation of the catalyst was attributed to the formation of NiNb2O6.IrO2 catalysts In contrast to most metal oxides, where initial CH bond activation is the RDS of ethane ODH, the first CH bond activation of ethane is a fast reaction over IrO2 catalysts. A DFT study of ethane activation over an IrO2(110) surface reported by Pham et al.321 indicated that ethane was most stably adsorbed on IrO2(110) by interacting with two adjacent Ircus (five-fold coordinated Ir) atoms, and ethane activation on IrO2(110) was both thermodynamically (ΔE, PBE: 1.12 eV; optB88-vdW: 1.13 eV) and kinetically (Ea, PBE: 0.50 eV; optB88-vdW: 0.57 eV) favorable, which was expected to occur at low temperature. Similarly, the temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and DFT results reported by Bian et al.299 showed that ethylene desorption was the RDS in the conversion of ethane to ethylene over IrO2(110) during the TPRS. The DFT calculated barrier of ethane CH bond cleavage over clean IrO2(110) (0.39 eV) was much lower than that of ethylene desorption (1.96 eV). However, the DFT calculation predicted that the oxygen vacancy plays a significant role in ethane conversion. Partial hydrogenation of IrO2(110) was found to enhance ethane conversion to ethylene while suppressing ethane oxidation to COx species. According to DFT, hydrogenation of reactive O atoms of IrO2(110) to OH groups effectively inhibited these sites as H atom acceptors, resulting in ethylene desorption being favored over further dehydrogenation. The study revealed that IrO2(110) displayed an exceptional ability to promote C2H6 dehydrogenation to C2H4 near room temperature, and controlled deactivation of reactive O atoms was an effective way to facilitate ethylene production from ethane on IrO2(110). 3.2.2 Reaction mechanism with CO2 as an oxidant CO2 can also be used in ODH of ethane as a soft oxygenate.C2H6(g) + CO2(g)  C2H4(g) + CO(g) + H2O(l)ΔH25 = 1.39 eV (11) The advantage of this approach is that overoxidation of the reactants and products can be reduced and therefore the olefin selectivity can be enhanced.268 The effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and stability has been investigated on CrOx catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, and CexZr(1x)O2.322 The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species. The reaction pathway, catalytic activity, and stability of the catalyst depend on both the chromium state and support properties, in particular, on its acidbase and redox properties. On CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, ethylene is formed by a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by RWGS, while on CrOx/ZrO2, ethylene is formed by selective ODH. Besides the oxide surface, bimetallic catalysts also appear to be active for this reaction.In addition to producing ethylene via an ODH pathway through CH bond scission, the interaction of ethane with CO2 can also produce synthesis gas via a dry reforming pathway through CC bond scission. High ethylene selectivity can be achieved by using different catalysts to selectively promote the CH bond scission and preserve the CC bond scission. Chen and co-workers have done a lot of work on it.323326 They studied the dry reforming and ODH of ethane with CO2 as a soft oxidant on CeO2 supported bimetallic catalysts.323 It was found that CoPt/CeO2, CoMo/CeO2, and NiMo/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts favored the reforming pathway to produce synthesis gas via the CC bond cleavage, while FeNi/CeO2 favored the ODH pathway to produce ethylene via the CH bond cleavage. The DFT calculated energy profiles shown in Fig. 25 clearly demonstrate different pathways on the CoPt/CeO2 catalyst compared to the FeNi/CeO2 catalyst.The most likely active sites over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts were further elucidated by the same group by combining in situ characterization with DFT calculations.324 Both the experimental and theoretical results revealed that the NiFeOx interfacial sites could selectively break the CH bonds and preserve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleaved all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas. Similar work has been done on non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt catalysts supported on CeO2 for ODH of propane by CO2 of propane and dry reforming.327 DFT was performed on three representative surfaces: Fe3Ni, FeO/Ni(111), and Ni3Pt. The FeO/Ni(111) surface was used to represent potential FeONi interfacial active sites due to the observation of the FeO layer on the Ni surface during the reaction conditions. DFT results revealed that on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) the ODH reaction (ΔE = 0.29 eV and Ea = 1.02 eV) had lower reaction energy and activation energy than *O insertion reaction (ΔE = 0.43 eV and Ea = 3.30 eV). Therefore, the ODH reaction is more favorable along the CH bond cleavage pathway than the *O insertion reaction along the CC bond cleavage pathway. Similarly, on the FeO/Ni(111) surface, ODH reaction is favored over the CC bond cleavage dry reforming reaction. However, on the Ni3Pt catalyst, the CC bond cleavage is favored over CH bond cleavage dehydrogenation reaction.Chen and co-workers also found that the Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst preserved the CC bond cleavage of ethane to produce ethylene, while Pt/CeO2 preferably produced synthesis gas.325 These findings agreed with DFT results that the Mo2C(001) surface led to ethylene formation, and the CeO2/Pt(111) surface preferentially generated synthesis gas. Besides, the authors demonstrated that a MoOx modified Mo2C surface was related to ethylene formation in ethane ODH with CO2.326 Oxygen modification was able to inhibit the CC bond cleavage and reduce coke formation. The Fe promoter could accelerate the formation of the surface MoOx layer and stabilize it, leading to a higher ethylene yield and improved stability.An ab initio microkinetic model (MKM) was constructed to investigate the reactivity trends of transition metal catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 as a mild oxidant.328 Both direct ethane dehydrogenation and O-assisted ethane dehydrogenation on terrace (111) and step (211) surfaces were studied. Ethane was predominantly converted to ethylene via direct dehydrogenation on both surfaces. Towards O-assisted ethane dehydrogenation (CO2 consumption), Co, Ru, Ni, and Rh were more active than other transition metals on both surfaces (Fig. 26a and b). In an attempt to screen bimetallic alloys to achieve greater CO2 consumption activity with reduced coke formation, three potential bimetallic alloys (Ni3Fe, Ni3Co and Pt3Co) were selected (Fig. 26c). Out of them, two were tested experimentally, and FeNi/CeO2 has shown some promise for ethane dehydrogenation along with CO2 reduction.Fig. 26 Elementary reaction rate for oxygen assisted ethane dehydrogenation (C2H6 + O  C2H5 + OH) over the (a) (111) surface and (b) (211) surface of transition metal catalysts; and (c) screened alloy candidates.328 Reproduced from ref. 328 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2020.
4. Activation of CH bonds of propane and propylene
Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration. By DFT calculations, the surface electronic structures of catalysts can be studied, mainly for exploring the active sites, stability, and modulation mechanism on the surface. Then, the elementary steps of dehydrogenation reaction involved in the network of the main and side reactions, together with the migration of H on the catalyst surface, are investigated to identify a favorable reaction pathway. Besides, the kinetic analysis can further convert the rate constants of the elementary steps calculated with DFT to the corresponding turnover rates under the reaction conditions, and consequently, it can determine the activity trend and rate-determining steps. It is therefore of great interest to employ theoretical calculations as a tool for investigating how the PDH and ODH catalysts function on an atomic scale. We will see that, by using microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations, the crucial roles of different active sites, promoters, and supports, and reaction pathways and RDSs29 can be explained, which guides the investigation toward a more effective catalyst for PDH and ODH. The progress in computational catalysis of PDH and ODH is reviewed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
4.1 CH bond activation in propane on metals
4.1.1 Adsorption of propane and propylene on metal surfaces In the last few decades, the activation of CH bonds of propane over transition-metal and alloy surfaces has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.341346 The surface reaction of PDH can lead to numerous fragments ranging from C1 to C3 species adsorbed on these surfaces. As for the C3 species, propane and propylene are the reactant and the desired main product, respectively,347,348 and their adsorption on metal surfaces has been the subject of extensive research.349351 Generally, because the propane molecule is a saturated compound and has no unpaired electron, there is no hybridization between propane and metal d states, and therefore propane is physisorbed on the metal surfaces.347,349,352 The lengths of the CH and CC bonds of adsorbed propane are found to be almost the same as those of the isolated propane (CH: 1.101.11 Å, CC: 1.53 Å).349,351 The equilibrium adsorption distances between propane and metal surfaces are in the range from 2.5 to 4.5 Å, suggesting that this is mainly an intermolecular interaction.348,350,352,353 On flat surfaces such as Pt(111), the GGA-PBE adsorption energies of propane at different adsorption sites fall within the range of 0.02 to 0.06 eV, as presented in Table 2.349,354 The small variation in adsorption energy from site to site indicates that propane does not favor any particular site on the flat metal surfaces. The adsorption energies of propane are generally underestimated by the PBE functional because the standard GGA fails to account for long-range vdW interactions between propane and metal surfaces. With the vdW correction considered, the adsorption energy of propane becomes much more negative.353 For the stepped metal surface, propane preferably adsorbs at the hollow site below the step edge, and the adsorption energies are in the range from 0.39 to 0.46 eV.331,355 Clearly, the propane molecule experiences more attractive interactions from the stepped surface than those from the flat surface because there exists a larger contact area between them, and the strength of dispersion forces tends to increase with increasing molecular size. Moreover, alloying of Pt with metals such as Sn did not alter the adsorption energy (Table 2).350

Valcrcel et al. proposed a schematic representation of adsorbed propylene on Pt(111), where these surface structures mainly depend on coverage and temperature.359 At temperatures below 230 K, propylene is undissociated to adsorb on the metal surface, as is the case for ethylene. The diσ and π models are the most common propylene chemisorption configurations on metal surfaces, as shown in Fig. 27(a). The adsorption configuration depends on the site coverage of propylene, and the diσ mode through its unsaturated CC bond at a short bridge site is predominant below half-saturation coverage, with the CC bond being nearly parallel to the surface, and the methyl group would tilt away from the surface as the site coverage is close to saturation. The adsorption energy of the diσ adsorption is generally more negative than that of the π adsorption.349,350,353,357,359 This can be explained by the larger valence charge density between the C and metal surface in the diσ bond than in the π adsorption, indicating a stronger Cmetal bond, as shown in Fig. 27(b). The strong adsorption weakens the CC bond.360 Upon the diσ adsorption over metal surfaces, the length of the double CC bond in propylene increases from 1.36 (in gas-phase propylene) to about 1.50 Å,349,351,353 which is close to the single CC bond length of propane. This change, together with the fact that propylene loses its planarity as the CH bonds bend away from the surface plane, indicates the rehybridization of the C atom from sp2 to sp3, and the CC bond is therefore weakened by forming covalent bonds with Pt atoms. On Pt(100)357 and Pt(211) surfaces,347 propylene adsorption also prefers the diσ mode to the π mode. The adsorption energy of propylene follows the order of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), as can be seen in Table 2. Although the estimated adsorption energy depends on the functionals used, it does not change the trend on the different surfaces. The adsorption energy on Pt(111) obtained with the vdWDF functional agrees well with the experimental desorption energy determined using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements.350 Fig. 27 (a) Adsorption modes of propylene on Pt surfaces.357 Reproduced from ref. 357 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2014.

Alloying Pt(111) with less reactive metal Sn leads to weaker propylene adsorption, as can be seen in Table 2.350 Propylene binds preferentially to the Pt3Sn(111) surface in the diσ mode, similar to that on Pt(111), but the adsorption is weak on the PtSn2(111) surface and dominated by vdW interactions. This result is mainly attributed to the geometric effect of introduced Sn, which reduces the number of PtPt diσ sites accessible by propylene, whereas the electronic effect that originated from the interaction energy of the PtPt diσ sites was found to be small.
4.1.2 Activation of the first CH bond of propane The propane dehydrogenation process involves a relatively complex reaction network and a large number of reaction intermediates and the elementary steps involved are mainly the CH and CC bond-breaking reactions. These elementary steps can be divided into three categories, as shown in Fig. 28(a): (1) the dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene (steps 14), (2) the deep dehydrogenation steps from propylene to 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl (steps 5 and 6), and (3) the CC bond cleavage reactions of propane, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, and propylene (steps 710).357 The initial CH bond cleavage at the methyl (step 1) or methylene (step 2) groups of physisorbed propane is often the RDS that governs the rate law of the overall dehydrogenation reaction, leading to the 1-propyl or 2-propyl species.358

The detached H atoms are not included for clarity. The numbers signify the sequence numbers of the elementary steps.347,357 Reproduced from ref. 347 with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies, copyright 2011.

The CH bond dissociation energy of propane is 4.35 and 4.17 eV for the primary and secondary CH bond scission, respectively. In the catalytic system, the energy barriers for the initial activation of the propane CH bonds at the methyl and methylene groups are 0.69 and 0.70 eV on Pt(111), respectively, which indicates that there is no particular preference for the activation of CH bonds on the surface.347 For the transition states of propane activation on Pt surfaces, propane is bonded to Pt surfaces via the C atom, where the H in CH is bonded to adjunct Pt. The CH bonds at the methyl group are stretched by 1.50 Å (see Fig. 28b), as compared to the CH bond length in gas-phase propane (1.10 Å). The geometries of the transition states on Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) are almost identical, as shown in Fig. 28(b). The CH bond activation follows the universal scaling relationship, as shown in eqn (4). The lower CH bond energy leads to a lower activation energy of propane activation than ethane and methane activation. The activation energies of the first dehydrogenation steps on Pt(211) are lower than those on Pt(100) and Pt(111) due to the higher hydrogen affinity on the unsaturated surfaces, where the lower activation energies for propane give higher dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces. The activated CH bonds are stretched by 0.360.41 Å. The energy barriers for the activation of CH bonds occurring at the two groups are calculated to be 0.32 and 0.28 eV on stepped Pt(211), and 0.43 and 0.42 eV on Pt(100), respectively.357 The addition of one or more main-group metals or TMs is an effective way to modify Pt-based catalysts.350,361,362 DFT calculations revealed that the Sn component could broaden the d-band of Pt, giving rise to a downshift of the d-band center, and the dehydrogenation activity ranked in the descending order is: Pt(111) > Pt3Sn(111) (bulk alloy) > Pt3Sn/Pt(111) (surface alloy) > PtSn2(111) (bulk alloy) > Pt2Sn/Pt(111) (surface alloy).348 In addition to Pt-based catalysts, other metal catalysts, such as metal Ni, intermetallic PdZn, and PdCu, have also been studied for the activation of CH bonds.351,363,364 Saelee et al. reported that the activation energy for the first dehydrogenation of propane on Ni(111) (0.69 eV) is close to that on Pt(111) (0.70 eV). Single Pd atoms at the edge site of Cu55 clusters can facilitate the first CH bond cleavage, and the energy barrier predicted using the PBE functional is 1.06 eV, approximately 0.25 eV lower than the corresponding barrier on pure Cu55 clusters. With the correction of the vdWDF functional, this energy barrier is increased to 1.17 eV.364
4.1.3 Mechanism of propane dehydrogenation to propylene on metal surfaces Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274 The dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 28(a) (steps 14), and the energy barriers for these four steps can describe the catalytic activity of metal surfaces for propylene production.357Table 3 summarizes some of the calculated energy barriers of PDH over Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) surfaces.340,347,353,357 From the table, one can see that the energy barriers for both the first and second CH bond activations of propane follow the order Pt(211) < Pt(100) < Pt(111). The stepped Pt surfaces having coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms are kinetically more favorable for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene than the flat surfaces. Recently, however, Xiao et al.365 suggested that although PDH over Pt(111) follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, as shown in Fig. 29, an unexpected non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(211) is proposed to dominate the kinetics.

(c) Simplified reaction networks for PDH over Pt(111) and Pt(211).365 Reproduced from ref. 365 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2020.
In addition, the strongly endothermic nature of PDH (ΔrH = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion.366 However, side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation, can be promoted even more dramatically by the increase in temperature.332,367 As a result, ethylene (or ethane), methane, and coke are often produced in the PDH reaction as byproducts. The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst. It is thus essential to include not only the CH bond activation but also the CC bond cleavage in the whole catalytic cycle of PDH for the kinetic analysis. Yang et al. systematically investigated the PDH process on flat and stepped Pt surfaces, including Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211).347,349,357 They focused on the kinetics of the CH bond activation of all the C3 intermediates in PDH, containing 17 dehydrogenation elementary reactions (see Fig. 30) and 12 CC bond-breaking steps. As an example, the energy profile for PDH on Pt(111) is shown in Fig. 30(b). The insights provided by these studies are summarized as follows: Fig. 30 (a) The network of surface reactions of PDH, not including the adsorption reactions of gases and dissociation of H2.

(1) A good scaling relation was found between the transition-state energy and the final-state energy for C3Hx (x = 39) dehydrogenation. CC bond cleavage steps have higher transition state energy and hence higher activation energy than CH activation.347 The adsorption strength of the intermediates is the key parameter in tuning the activity and selectivity. The stepped Pt surfaces are kinetically more favorable than the flat surfaces for the dehydrogenation of propane because of the stronger adsorption of intermediates on Pt(211).347,368 (2) The activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption was identified as the selectivity descriptor. Lowering the desorption energy and increasing the CH bond activation barrier of propylene are crucial for increasing the propylene selectivity. Both quantities are closely related to the adsorption strength of propylene. The selectivity towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms due to the strong adsorption of propylene, which has recently been widely used to screen promising candidates as the catalysts for PDH.331,345,354,369 (3) The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the microkinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353 (4) PDH to propylene follows the generally accepted reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism over Pt(111), while over Pt(211), a non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism dominates.365 The experimental354 and theoretical analyses of Gibbs energy profiles of the PDH reaction340,353 suggest that the first CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(211) and Pt(100) for smaller Pt cluster sizes, while the second CH bond activation is the RDS on Pt(111). The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis.340 It should be noted that the energy barriers for the first and second CH bond activations are quite close on Pt(111). The RDS could change with the reaction conditions.
So far, there have been only three microkinetic studies of PDH based on a relatively full description of the reaction pathway of dehydrogenation to propylene, deep dehydrogenation, and CC bond cracking over Pt(111) surfaces, which were carried out by Saerens et al.,340 Lian et al.,353 and Xiao et al.,365 respectively. The DFT-based kMC simulations by Lian et al. reveal that there are quick deactivation and steady states during the PDH process.353 The precursor of coke is mainly formed during the rapid deactivation, which originates from the coverage of cracking products at the active sites. Then, the surface species and active sites covered by the hardly removed coke lead to the steady-state after quick deactivation. Saerens et al.340 focused their studies on the influence of hydrogen co-feeding on the reaction mechanism of PDH. They pointed out that the increasing the co-feeding hydrogen pressure can decrease the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors and increase the number of free sites on the Pt(111) surface; moreover, this increase in free sites can lead to higher catalytic activity. The modeling results rationalized the experimental observation of the reduced coke formation and enhanced propylene selectivity by co-feeding hydrogen in PDH.340,353 By using microkinetic analysis in combination with results from DFT calculations, Xiao et al.365 found that a non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism accounts for more than half the propylene production at the under-coordinated active sites that dominate the kinetics of PDH (see Fig. 29), which consists of three dehydrogenation steps that have two β-H and one α-H atoms removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2, and at this species the deep dehydrogenation reaction competes with the production of propylene.
The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke formation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353 The formed C1 and C2 species could desorb to form ethane, ethylene, and methane or serve as coke precursors.340 Then, the formation of coke could block the active sites of the catalyst, impede the catalytic activity, and eventually deactivate the catalyst.331,353 Lian et al. studied the detailed reaction pathway of propylene formation, deep dehydrogenation, and CC bond cracking for understanding the origin of coke formation.353 The deep dehydrogenations are via R6  R11 and R10 and finally lead to the cracking of C3 species, mainly starting from propyne (see Fig. 30). The coke precursors are mainly formed during the quick deactivation, and the active sites are mainly occupied by C2 and C1 species, which are hardly removed from the surface. However, the covered active sites, after quick deactivation, can lead to a stable state, which can hinder the side reactions to achieve a stable selectivity. Besides, the co-adsorption of carbon can shift the d-band centers of the surface Pt atoms further below the Fermi level, leading to a decrease in the catalytic activity for PDH.340 Zhu et al. proposed that coke formation is not structure-sensitive, as coke can be formed by all Pt facets and can preferentially cover the under-coordinated active sites.354 The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation. Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation.353
4.1.4 Guidelines for improving the selectivity and coke resistance The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and cracking of the subsequent C3 derivatives. The formation of ethane, methane, and coke would lower selectivity to propylene. The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. This provides a guideline for design of PDH catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.
Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor.370 To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. For example, Zhu et al. reported that the Pt catalysts of larger cluster sizes with (111) dominating the surface have higher selectivity toward propylene and better stability than the smaller clusters where (211) is dominant on the surface. This is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the higher energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111). Yang et al.354,357 proposed that the introduction of H can decrease the desorption barrier for propylene, and therefore, the selectivity toward gaseous propylene is improved. The Gibbs free energy of the dominant reaction pathways of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) on Pt(111) shows that with increasing H coverage the propylene adsorption strength decreases, while the energy barrier for the further dehydrogenation of propylene increases, leading to a higher catalytic selectivity.340 Previous studies have proved that alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH.2,290,373377 Among them, Sn is most widely studied due to its application in the industrial process. Yang et al.348 reported that with the increase in Sn content in PtSn alloys, the d-band centers of surface Pt atoms are shifted farther below the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 31(a), which changes the adsorption properties of Pt. According to the d-band model,378 downshifting the d-band center of surface atoms would reduce the interaction strength between the surface and adsorbates, whereas upshifting the d-band center of surface atoms may cause the antibonding states to, at least in part, shift up through the Fermi level and become empty, which eventually leads to a stronger binding strength of the adsorbate to the metal surface. Therefore, from the figure, one can see that an upshift of the d-band center gives rise to stronger binding of 1-propyl to the surface and a lower energy barrier for PDH to 1-propyl, which lowers the catalytic activity for PDH. Moreover, the step sites of Pt modified by adding Sn show more profound electron transfer from Sn to Pt on the PtSn alloy surfaces. In addition, the authors also investigated the competition between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption. They found that the introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation (see Fig. 31b). The electronic effect, i.e., the decrease in the interaction energy of the available PtPt diσ sites, and the geometric effect of the introduced Sn reducing the number of PtPt diσ sites accessible by propylene can weaken propylene adsorption, leading to a lower desorption barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and thus higher propylene selectivity than Pt(111).379 By considering the compromise between the catalytic activity and selectivity, the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is proposed to be the best candidate for PDH. The related experiments also proved that the Sn component added as a promoter in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can achieve higher propylene selectivity and minimize coke formation.334,373,380,381 The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability.381 Fig. 31 (a) Plots of the binding energies of 1-propyl (red dots) and the energy barriers for propylene dehydrogenation to 1-propyl (green dots) against the d-band centers over Pt(111) and PtSn surfaces.

Similarly, an improved catalytic performance was also reported on the Pt3Ti catalyst.382 As shown in Fig. 31(c), the d-band center of Pt(111) is located at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, whereas that of Pt3Ti(111) downshifts to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling, giving rise to weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates and changes in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions (see Fig. 31d and e). From the figure, one can see that the barrier for propylene desorption on Pt3Ti(111) is 0.25 eV lower than that on Pt(111), but the energy barrier for deep propylene dehydrogenation is increased by the introduction of Ti into Pt. Moreover, on the Pt3Ti(111) surface, the CC bond cracking steps are all endergonic and hence are hindered compared to Pt(111), where C3H5* and C3H4* cracking are exergonic and much more favorable. These results indicate that Pt3Ti has higher selectivity toward propylene for PDH compared to pure Pt. Wang et al. also studied the effect of Ga as a promoter of Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalysts on PDH, indicating that introduced Ga can decorate Pt NPs by forming PtGa alloys and, meanwhile, the Ga component can be incorporated into the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2. The metal Ga promoter on PtGa alloys can decrease the size of Pt ensembles or block the low-coordinated defect active sites, lower the desorption barrier of propylene and coke precursors by donating electrons to Pt atoms, and thus suppress undesirable side reactions to achieve better propylene selectivity. Besides, the promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability.376 Besides, the addition of one or more main-group metals or TMs, such as Sn, In, Cu, and Ga, is also an effective way to reduce the tendency to form coke.343,350,361,362 The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc.380,383,384 In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. Note that near-surface alloys (NSAs) having a host metal (such as Pt) as the subsurface and solute metals as the overlayer exhibit unique chemical and physical properties distinct from those of their constituent metals. Xiao et al.331 reported that by substituting late TMs for the Pt atoms in the core region, the adsorption and catalytic properties of the surface Pt atoms in M@Pt coreshell catalysts could be tuned, which is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of metal surfaces through the strain effect and electron transfer. The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene, as shown in Fig. 32(a). This figure also indicates that higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can be attained at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for PDH. Co@Pt is proposed to be the best coreshell catalyst for PDH if a compromise is made between catalytic activity and catalyst selectivity. Cesar et al.370 prepared bimetallic PtCo NPs for PDH with and without added H2 and studied the effect of the Co loading amount on the core structure from Pt to Pt3Co to PtCo. The result shows that bimetallic NPs have significantly better olefin selectivity than either single metal, suggesting that Co that acts as a less active promoter can utilize the geometric effects to enhance the selectivity by breaking up large Pt ensembles in the bimetallic catalysts. Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al.331 Besides, Sun et al.385 pointed out that the isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu NPs can break the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (see Fig. 32b). In other words, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy maintains a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time displays quite a high selectivity, which is reflected by the low free energy barrier difference between the propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation. Therefore, the use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts.

(c) Profiles of the potential-energy surface for PDH on Rh13-Ls, Rh13-Ls/UGO and Rh13-Ls/TiO2, where Rh13-Ls is the low-symmetry Rh13 cluster and UGO is the unzipped grapheneoxide.386 Reproduced from ref. 386 with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies, copyright 2017.Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH.387,388 Chang et al.386 investigated the PDH over Rh13-Ls (low-symmetry Rh13 cluster), Rh13-Ls/UGO (Rh13-Ls cluster supported on a sheet of unzipped graphene oxide), and Rh13-Ls/TiO2 catalysts. They found that although electrons flowed from the Rh13 cluster towards both supports, the UGO support induced an electronic redistribution of the Rh13 cluster rather than just abstracting electronic charge from the Rh13 cluster to the support, as compared with the TiO2 counterparts. UGO would induce an electronic accumulation onto the top area of the Rh13 cluster, while TiO2 induced electronic depletion, which dictates different results for PDH. As shown in Fig. 32(c), for the Rh13-Ls/UGO system, the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of propane to propyl is 0.22 eV, and the calculated energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of propyl is 0.16 eV. UGO as a support could lower the energy barriers for both two dehydrogenation steps of propane, but TiO2 as a support increased the energy barriers for both dehydrogenation steps, indicating that the UGO sheet is a more suitable support for the Rh13-Ls cluster and for activation of the CH bond in PDH. Besides, Jiang et al.389 found that the addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.
4.2 CH oxidative activation on metal oxides
Although the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is a rather promising solution, the ODH of propane has some advantages: ODH is thermodynamically favored even at low temperatures and can avoid the formation of coke.303,390,391 Besides, unlike the PDH reaction, the ODH of propane is mainly based on the following two mechanisms: first, lattice oxygen is involved in the reaction, and then the oxygen vacancies formed can be filled by the added oxidants (removal of lattice oxygen anions and their reinsertion); second, lattice oxygen is not involved in the reaction; however, the oxidants can be adsorbed on the surface to react with the reactants or intermediates.392,393 Supported vanadium oxides are known to be one of the best catalysts for the ODH reaction with high thermal stability and a relatively large surface area. Several research groups have studied the mechanism of ODH reaction on metal oxide catalysts, usually following the MVK redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation.394396 This redox mechanism mostly occurs on transition-metal oxide catalysts with relatively high reducibility. It can be generally described as a two-step mechanism: (1) the reduction of the oxide surface by the dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon  the catalyst in the oxidation state activates the CH bond and therefore the dissociated H atoms combine with the lattice oxygen atoms to desorb in the form of H2O; and (2) the subsequent reoxidation by gas-phase oxygen  the generated oxygen vacancies complete the circulation process of the catalyst surface under the action of oxygen.29,397,398 The CH bond activation in propane on (un)supported metal oxides such as VOx, Cr2O3, ZnO, V2O3, and Ga2O32,303,339,391,399406 has been studied theoretically by using DFT calculations in which the active sites and reaction mechanism were focused. The reduction step has comprehensively been studied, and the full catalytic cycle is not considered because the oxidation of the substrate is typically a fast step.336
4.2.1 VOx catalysts The V2O5(001) surface is the most stable surface exposed in crystalline V2O5 formed at high vanadium loadings. It is generally accepted that there are three types of lattice oxygen on V2O5(001), which are singly coordinated terminal oxygen (O1), twofold-coordinated oxygen (O2), and threefold-coordinated oxygen (O3), as shown in Fig. 33. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have proposed that the terminal O1 and the bridging lattice O2 serve as the active sites assisting in the CH bond activation in propane,399,407 which is in good agreement with the DFT calculations by Fu et al.303 They reported three possible CH activation mechanisms for the oxygen-assisted first CH bond activation over the V2O5(001) surface, including oxo-insertion, concerted, and radical mechanisms (see Fig. 34a). The reaction mechanism depends on the identity of the active sites. It was found that both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible at the O1 sites, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is preferred at the O2 sites. In addition, the activation energies for CH activation for the secondary CH bond are lower than those for the primary CH bond, in agreement with the order of the CH bond dissociation energies in propane.

The reactivity of O sitting on V2O5(001) follows the order of O1 > O2 > O3. The energy barriers of activation of the first CH bond in propane are 1.18 and 1.32 eV at the O1 and O2 sites, respectively, as shown in Fig. 34(b). The threefold-coordinated oxygen (O3) is the least active for CH bond activation and almost inert.303 The i-propoxide can much more easily further decompose into propylene at the O2 site, releasing an H atom to a neighboring O2 or O3 atom, and the corresponding energy barrier is 0.95 eV lower than that at the O1 site (>1.30 eV). The H2O formation through the recombination of two OH groups at the O1 site is facile, and H2O desorption is endothermic with a relatively low reaction energy of 0.56 eV, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. As the lattice oxygen is removed, the structure of the catalyst may collapse, indicating that the V2O5(001) surface is fully dynamic.
For the second H abstraction step, the reaction energy is 1.58 eV, and the estimated activation barrier is 0.65 eV, where the surface reconstruction is not taken into account.399,409 Gas-phase reactions of propane with VO2+ and V3O7+ have also been studied.410,411 When considering the more complex reaction conditions of vanadium oxide catalysts involving supports and O2 adsorption, some of the energy barriers could be affected, such as propane adsorption and H2O elimination. However, the terminal O1 is too active to release propylene and therefore shows poor propylene selectivity.
4.2.2 Supported VOx catalysts For supported VOx catalysts, the effect of supports and VOx dispersion for propane ODH has been widely studied.15,404,412 The binding strength of the surface lattice oxygen in the VOx surface species is a key parameter that governs the activities and selectivities for propane ODH.406 Active sites Depending on the loading of VOx on the support, the VOx can present as an isolated monomer, dimer, and polymer (sub-monolayer, a monolayer) and crystalline structure.404,413 Three types of lattice O are identified, such as (a) terminal VO sites, (b) bridging VOV sites, and (c) VOsupport sites.403,414 The active sites depend on the catalyst structure on the surface. On the supported monomeric VOx, there are two different types of available active O sites, namely terminal VO sites and VOsupport interface sites. For the dimer and polymer VOx, there are additional bridging VOV sites. Activation of propane requires a pair of oxygen sites denoted as OAOB as the active sites, where V is inert.414 The active sites are highly dynamic, and there are a large number of combinations of two oxygen sites among the three O sites. Activation of propane and propylene The activation of propane has been studied on the isolated monomeric OV(O)3 supported on SiO2,401 a VOx monolayer on TiO2(001),403 and monomeric and dimeric VOx species supported on the (001) and (100) surfaces of anatase TiO2.414 Regardless of the supports, propane undergoes preliminary weak physical adsorption on the surface prior to dissociation. Unlike the non-selective activation on the metal surfaces, the secondary CH bond activation is energetically preferred compared to the primary CH bond activation, in agreement with the order of the CH bond dissociation energies in propane. CH bond activation follows similar mechanisms on the unsupported V2O5(001). The activation energies for hydrogen abstraction are almost the same at the different active sites of the unsupported catalyst, i.e., O1  O2  O3, while they increase in the order O1 < O2 < O3 on the supported catalyst.403
On the supported VOx monolayer on TiO2(001), the CH bond activation in propane is via a concerted mechanism at the VO site, leading to the formation of the metal hydride and adsorbed propoxide.403 The vanadyl site (VO) is the most active site on V2O5(001) and V2O5/TiO2, while the bridging VOV sites are more selective towards propylene. The rate-limiting step of oxidative PDH is the activation of propane via a direct H abstraction from the methylene CH, based on the reaction path analysis at 0 K. The TiO2 support enhances the CH bond activation as compared to unsupported V2O5 by lowering the activation energy of the RDS as shown in Fig. 35 and influences the selectivity of the supported monolayer VOx catalyst towards propylene production rather than propanol and acetone.

The VOx monomers and dimers supported on SiO2 have also been studied by Rozanska et al.415 The first H abstraction from propane is the RDS and yields activation barriers at 750 K, which are lower for dimeric VOx (1.18 eV) than for monomeric VOx (1.29 eV). Using the reaction energy as a reactivity descriptor, the energy barriers for propane ODH decrease with increasing VOx coverage from dimers to larger oligomers. Besides, VV/VIV redox cycles are preferred over VV/VIII cycles.
Dependence of activity on supports and cluster size Various oxides such as TiO2, SiO2, CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 have been studied as the supports of VOx.394,416418 The activity of the active sites in VOx depends strongly on the supports, which is ascribed to the electronic modification of active oxygen sites.414 TiO2 is the most widely studied support owing to the highest activity of VOx/TiO2. Du et al. observed that propane ODH activity can be tuned by supporting on anatase TiO2 surface and changing VOx dispersion.414 The activation energy of the first CH activation and the formation energy of propylene on the monomeric and dimeric VOx species supported on the anatase TiO2(001) and (100) surfaces are summarized in Table 4.

By comparing the energy barrier of the first CH activation step and the overall energy barrier of propylene formation on TiO2(001) and (100) surfaces given in Table 4,414 it can be seen that the catalysts supported on the (100) surface show higher activity than those on the (001) surface. For the monomer, dimer, and monolayer of VOx, the valence bond formed at the interface of VOx and support surfaces. The interface electronic transfer resulted in the modification of the electronic structure of VOx species, as evidenced by the projected p-DOS plots where the centers of the valence bands of the VOx/TiO2(100) surfaces are closer to the Fermi level than those of the VOx/TiO2(001) surfaces. This is also reflected in more negative Bader charges of oxygen sites on the (100) than (001) surfaces. This indicates that the oxygen sites are the nucleophilic centers to attack the positively charged H atoms and activate the CH bond. The stronger basic oxygen sites with more negative charges in VOx supported on (100) attack more efficiently the acidic CH bond, and thus result in higher activities than those on the (001) surfaces. In addition, the support changed the relative charge of the oxygen sites. For example, the higher activity of the terminal VO sites than that of the VOTi interface sites on the dimeric VOx/TiO2(001) can be ascribed to the more negatively charged O on the former sites.
A comparative study of PDH on monomeric and dimeric VOx supported on γ-Al2O3 and V2O5 crystal, as shown in Fig. 36, revealed that the cluster size has a remarkable influence on the relative activity of oxygen sites and the rate-determining step.404 The first CH bond activation has a lower activation barrier than the secondary CH activation on the supported V2O5, while both CH bond activations have similar energy barriers on the supported VO3. Besides, the O p-band center could correlate with the dehydrogenation barrier of the O sites to predict the dehydrogenation activity. Luo et al. also reported that mixed CaO and γ-Al2O3 supported VOx is beneficial to the propylene formation compared to pure CaO supported VOx, which is attributed to the moderate level of acidity and metalsupport interaction.419 Fig. 36 Reaction energy profiles of C3H6* formation and CH3COCH3* formation by two successive H ruptures of C3H8* over (a) supported monomeric VO3/Al2O3, (b) supported dimeric V2O5/Al2O3, and (c) slab V2O5(001) surfaces.

Moreover, p-DOS analysis suggests that the electronic structure depends on the VOx cluster size or dispersion, which rationalizes the activity dependence of the cluster size of VOx on the support. The monomer dispersed VOx is more active than the dimer dispersed VOx on the TiO2(001) surface, while the dimer dispersed VOx is more active than the monomer dispersed VOx on the TiO2(100) surface.414 Cheng et al.420 reported that the coordination number of the vanadium atom was the key structural parameter in predicting the catalytic activity, showing that the activation energy of the first dehydrogenation step for propane on anatase-supported vanadium oxide monomers and dimers is 1.73 eV and 1.91 eV, respectively.
The above discussion reveals that the support surface and the dispersion of the VOx catalyst change the electronic properties of the oxygen sites and thus change their activity in activating the CH bond of propane. The oxygen activity in VOx seems to be of vital importance for CH bond activation.
The activity of the lattice oxygen can also be described by the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy. The formation energy of surface oxygen vacancy can be identified as a dominant parameter in determining the adsorption mode and the catalytic activity of metal oxides.421 Li et al. reported that the formation energy of surface oxygen vacancy could be used as a descriptor to explain the adsorption behaviors, which is more sensitive to the change in the electronic structure of perovskites, arising from the fact that the actual partial charges the oxygen and transition-metal ions carry determine the adsorption behaviors of the oxygen and transition-metal ions.422 The estimated formation energies of oxygen vacancy of VOx are summarized in Table 5.

Likewise, the TiO2 support lowered the formation energy of oxygen vacancy, thus increasing the activity. The formation energy of the oxygen vacancy can therefore be used as a descriptor when searching for new catalysts for ODH of propane.
