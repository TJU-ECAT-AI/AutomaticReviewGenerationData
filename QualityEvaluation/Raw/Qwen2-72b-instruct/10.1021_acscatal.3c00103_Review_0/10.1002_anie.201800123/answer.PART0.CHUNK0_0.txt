1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

1.工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性促使了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，为丙烯生产提供了一条替代途径。由于其活性、选择性和再生性能，支持的钒氧化物正被探索为PDH的有希望的催化剂。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在理解表面结合的羟基团的作用上，这些羟基团可以通过抑制焦炭沉积来提高催化剂的稳定性，焦炭沉积是失活的主要原因。通过调整催化剂表面羟基团的覆盖度，可以平衡活性和稳定性，从而在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中提高可回收性和性能。
