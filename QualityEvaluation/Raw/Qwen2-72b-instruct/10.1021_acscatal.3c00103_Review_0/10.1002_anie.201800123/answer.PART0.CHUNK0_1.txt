1.The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature.

1.文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了使用支撑的钒氧化物作为PDH的替代催化剂，这些催化剂具有相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和优异的再生性能。文献还探讨了表面结合的羟基对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的影响，它可以提高催化剂的稳定性，通过抑制焦炭沉积。在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性的创新催化剂设计策略在文献中没有明确提及。
