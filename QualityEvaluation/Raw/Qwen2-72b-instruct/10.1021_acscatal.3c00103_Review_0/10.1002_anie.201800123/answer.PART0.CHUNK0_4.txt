1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for on-purpose propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are considered promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding and controlling the surface structure of vanadium catalysts under reaction conditions to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. The presence of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, leading to better catalyst performance in nonoxidative PDH processes.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供丙烯的替代生产途径来应对这些挑战。由于其活性、选择性和再生性能，支持的钒氧化物被认为是PDH的有希望的催化剂。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在理解和控制反应条件下钒催化剂的表面结构，以克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性。在VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂上存在表面结合的羟基已被证明通过抑制焦炭沉积来提高稳定性，从而在非氧化PDH过程中获得更好的催化剂性能。
