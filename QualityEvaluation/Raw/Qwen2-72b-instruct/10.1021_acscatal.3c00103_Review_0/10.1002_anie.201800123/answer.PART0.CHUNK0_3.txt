1.The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

1.文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了将支撑的钒氧化物作为PDH的替代催化剂,这可以提供相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和优异的再生性能。研究集中于表面羟基对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的影响,表明尽管这些基团轻微抑制脱氢活性,但它们通过抑制焦炭沉积提高了催化剂稳定性。这表明,创新的催化剂设计策略,如控制表面结构和羟基的存在,可以帮助克服非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题,增强稳定性。
