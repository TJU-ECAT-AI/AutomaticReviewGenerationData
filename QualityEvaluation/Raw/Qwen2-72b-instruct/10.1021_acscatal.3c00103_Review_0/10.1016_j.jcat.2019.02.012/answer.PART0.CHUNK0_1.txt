1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an on-purpose production route that can close the gap between propene demand and production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which have shown industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by controlling the phase composition and crystallite size of ZrO2, with monoclinic ZrO2 showing higher activity and selectivity to propene than tetragonal ZrO2 due to its ability to release lattice oxygen and create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供一种目的性生产途径，可以弥补丙烯需求与生产之间的差距。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善循环利用性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。这些策略包括使用基于ZrO2的环保和成本高效的催化剂，这些催化剂在C3和C4烷烃的非氧化脱氢中显示出工业相关的活性和烯烃选择性。通过控制ZrO2的相组成和晶粒尺寸，可以调节这些催化剂的活性和选择性，其中单斜ZrO2由于其释放晶格氧和创建负责丙烷活化的配位不饱和锆离子(Zrcus位点)的能力，显示出比四方ZrO2更高的活性和对丙烯的选择性。
