1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites.
