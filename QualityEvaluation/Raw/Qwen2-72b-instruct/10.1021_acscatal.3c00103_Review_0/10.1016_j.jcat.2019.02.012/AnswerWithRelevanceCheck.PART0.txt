          In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

          在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供高丙烯选择性，成为大规模生产丙烯的主要工艺之一。为解决失活问题、提高稳定性和改善循环利用性，正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略包括使用基于ZrO2的环保、成本高效的催化剂，这些催化剂在C3和C4烷烃的非氧化脱氢中表现出工业相关的活性和烯烃选择性。这些催化剂可以通过相组成和晶粒尺寸进行优化，催化剂在还原处理时释放晶格氧的能力对于活性位点的形成至关重要。通过改变ZrO2的晶粒尺寸和相组成，可以调节这些催化剂的活性和选择性，其中较小的晶粒尺寸和单斜相显示出更高的活性和丙烯选择性。丙烯的活性和选择性随着晶粒尺寸的减小而增加，单斜ZrO2的性能优于四方ZrO2。相组成和晶粒尺寸对PDH性能的影响与ZrO2在还原催化剂处理下释放晶格氧的能力有关，从而形成配位不饱和的锆离子(Zrcus位点)，这些位点负责丙烷的活化。
