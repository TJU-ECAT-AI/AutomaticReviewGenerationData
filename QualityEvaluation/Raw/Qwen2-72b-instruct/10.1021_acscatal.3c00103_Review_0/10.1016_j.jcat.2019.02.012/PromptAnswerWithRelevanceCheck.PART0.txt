1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which have shown industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene.

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an on-purpose production route that can close the gap between propene demand and production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which have shown industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by controlling the phase composition and crystallite size of ZrO2, with monoclinic ZrO2 showing higher activity and selectivity to propene than tetragonal ZrO2 due to its ability to release lattice oxygen and create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an on-purpose route for propylene production with high selectivity. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of bare ZrO2 materials with controlled phase composition (monoclinic or tetragonal) and crystallite size, which have shown improved performance in non-oxidative PDH. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation. The knowledge derived can be used for further optimizing PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts and also extended to other non-reducible metal oxides.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供高选择性的丙烯生产途径来应对这些挑战。为了克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高循环利用性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，这些策略适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。这些策略包括使用具有受控相组成(单斜或四方)和晶粒尺寸的裸ZrO2材料，这些材料在非氧化PDH中表现出改进的性能。丙烯的活性和选择性随着晶粒尺寸的减小而增加，单斜ZrO2的性能优于四方ZrO2。相组成和晶粒尺寸对PDH性能的影响与ZrO2在还原催化剂处理下释放晶格氧的能力有关，从而形成配位不饱和的锆离子(Zrcus位点)，这些位点负责丙烷的活化。所获得的知识可用于进一步优化ZrO2基催化剂的PDH性能，也可扩展到其他不可还原的金属氧化物。
