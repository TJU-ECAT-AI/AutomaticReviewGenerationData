1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering an on-purpose production route that can close the gap between propene demand and production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which have shown industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned through the kind of crystal phase (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size, providing hints for designing ZrO2-based catalysts with improved performance.
