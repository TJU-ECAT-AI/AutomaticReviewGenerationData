[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
[2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
[3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
[4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
[6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow (Fig. 10a)."
[7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
[8] "In terms of a localised CH2CH2CM3 complex, this would have Cs symmetry with only the a modes allowed by the MSSR."
[9] "These are, respectively, ν(CH3)as, ν(CH3)s, ν(CH2)s, δ(CH3)as, δ(CH3)s, δ(CH2) (scissors), CH2 wag, CH3 rock and two ν(CC) modes."
[10] "Other mode components of ν(CH3)as, δ(CH3)as and CH3 rock, together with ν(CH2)as, CH2 twist and CH2 rock have a symmetry and are forbidden by the metal-surface selection rule (MSSR)."
[11] "For the room-temperature spectrum of propane and propene over Pt/SiO2, only additional weak absorptions occur at 2895, 1365 and 1355 cm1 together with a relative intensification of the band at 2920 cm1."
[12] "All these additional features are strengthened in the spectrum from the adsorption of propene, and additional weak bands occur at 30202980, 2820 and 1465 cm1."
[13] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
[14] "Additionally no band assignable to the ν(CC) mode of the π-complex has been observed in this case."
[15] "It therefore seems probable that the di-σ species is the most abundant additional species after propylidyne."
[16] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
[17] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al.,124 who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2,74 where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
[18] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
[19] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
[20] "Recently, Gong and coworkers126 showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
[21] "This could imply that electron-rich Pt atoms are selective but less reactive for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, which is in accordance with the above discussion."
[22] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
[23] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
[24] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
[25] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
[26] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
[27] "The competition between C3H6 desorption and C3H6 dehydrogenation can be used to evaluate the selectivity."
[28] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
[29] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
[30] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[31] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
[32] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
[33] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
[34] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
[35] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[36] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
[37] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h)."
[38] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[39] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
[40] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
[41] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[42] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
[43] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[44] "133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[45] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[46] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
[47] "134 Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[48] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[49] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[50] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[51] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[52] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[53] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[54] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[55] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[56] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[57] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[58] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[59] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44"
[60] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[61] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke (Fig. 13a and b)."
[62] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[63] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135"
[64] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136"
[65] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[66] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[67] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[68] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[69] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42"
[70] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms.72"
[71] "In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[72] "Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports."
[73] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[74] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[75] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[76] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[77] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[78] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[79] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[80] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138"
[81] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[82] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[83] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139"
[84] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[85] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[86] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140"
[87] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[88] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[89] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[90] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72"
[91] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[92] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[93] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[94] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
[95] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[96] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[97] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[98] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
[99] "141 In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
[100] "In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 C)."
[101] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
[102] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
[103] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[104] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a)."
[105] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
[106] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c).74"
[107] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
[108] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
[109] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation.55"
[110] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
[111] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
[112] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
[113] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation (Fig. 14d)."
[114] "Compared with Al2O3 supports (Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f).142"
[115] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
[116] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
[117] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
[118] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
[119] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm.143"
[120] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
[121] "A similar situation occurred again."
[122] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83"
[123] "As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h."
[124] "The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."
[125] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[126] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[127] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.144"
[128] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.63"
[129] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[130] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[131] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques to address these challenges. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, offer a route to produce propylene from propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from natural gas. However, deactivation issues, particularly coke formation, have been a significant challenge in PDH catalysts, leading to decreased activity and stability over time. To overcome these issues, innovative catalyst design strategies have been developed, focusing on enhancing stability and improving recyclability. These strategies include the use of geometric separation to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, electron richness to promote propylene desorption and suppress deep dehydrogenation, and poisoning acid sites to curb support acidity. Additionally, co-feeding streams like hydrogen and carbon dioxide can help eliminate coke and maintain catalyst stability. These approaches aim to create more stable and efficient PDH catalysts, which are crucial for the industrial production of propylene.

[21] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[22] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
[23] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
[24] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
[25] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[26] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
[27] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
[28] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[29] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
[30] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
[31] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[32] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
[33] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[34] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[35] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[36] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
[37] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[38] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[39] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[40] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[41] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[42] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[43] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[44] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[45] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[46] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[47] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[48] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[49] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
[50] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[51] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
[52] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[53] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
[54] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
[55] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[56] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[57] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[58] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[59] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
[60] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
[61] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[62] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[63] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
[64] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity."
[65] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[66] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[67] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[68] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[69] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
[70] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
[71] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[72] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
[73] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
[74] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[75] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[76] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
[77] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
[78] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[79] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[80] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[81] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
[82] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[83] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[84] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[85] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
[86] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
[87] "In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 C)."
[88] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
[89] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
[90] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
[92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
[93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
[94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
[95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
[96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
[98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
[99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
[100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
[101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
[102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
[103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
[104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
[105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
[106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
[107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
[108] "A similar situation occurred again."
[109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
[110] "As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h."
[111] "The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."
[112] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[113] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[114] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
[115] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
[116] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[117] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[118] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

[2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
[3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
[4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
[6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
[7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
[8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
[9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
[10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
[11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
[12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
[13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
[14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
[15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
[16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
[17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
[18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
[19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
[20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
[21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
[22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
[24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
[25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
[26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
[27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
[29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
[30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
[32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
[33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
[35] "In the following sections, we will introduce the deactivation mechanisms and the inhibition strategies."
[36] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[37] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[38] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[39] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
[40] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[41] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[42] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[43] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[44] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[45] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[46] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[47] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[48] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[49] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[50] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[51] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[52] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
[53] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[54] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
[55] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[56] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
[57] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
[58] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[59] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[60] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[61] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[62] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
[63] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
[64] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[65] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[66] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
[67] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[68] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[69] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[70] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[71] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[72] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
[73] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
[74] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[75] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
[76] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
[77] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[78] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[79] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
[80] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
[81] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[82] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[83] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
[88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
[89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
[90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
[91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
[92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
[93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
[94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
[95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
[96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
[97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
[98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
[99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
[100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
[101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
[102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
[103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
[104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
[105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
[106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
[107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
[108] "A similar situation occurred again."
[109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
[110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
[113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
[114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by converting propane to propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the use of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI). These approaches aim to improve the selectivity and stability of PDH catalysts, reduce the formation of coke, and prevent sintering of metal nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and recyclability of PDH processes.
2.Catalyst design strategies for PDH processes focus on modifying the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways, and deactivation mechanisms to enhance stability and recyclability. Alloying and dealloying can break scaling relationships and improve selectivity. Single atom catalysis, using supported single atoms, single-atom alloys, and intermetallic alloys, can maximize dispersion and break scaling relationships for enhanced activity and selectivity. Subsurface catalysis involves constructing core-shell structures with nonprecious elements to improve utilization efficiency and reduce costs. Defect engineering, such as creating oxygen vacancies, can enhance catalytic activity. Metal-hydride chemistry can stabilize hydrides on metal oxide surfaces for improved selectivity. SMSI can stabilize metal nanoparticles and improve redispersion after regeneration. These strategies aim to inhibit deactivation mechanisms, such as coke formation and sintering, and optimize catalyst performance.
3.Deactivation issues in PDH processes can be addressed through various strategies. Geometric separation of active metal components can inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions and improve propylene selectivity. Electron richness, achieved through alloying or addition of reducible metal oxides, can weaken Pt-CC bonds and inhibit coke precursors. Poisoning acid sites with alkaline promoters can reduce cracking and polymerization reactions. Cofeeding streams, such as H2 and CO2, can reduce coke formation and maintain catalyst stability. Enhancing oxygen mobility through the use of ceria can improve coke elimination. Coke transfer from metal surfaces to supports can prolong catalyst life. These strategies aim to inhibit deactivation mechanisms and improve the stability and recyclability of PDH catalysts.
4.Pt-based catalysts for PDH processes can suffer from deactivation due to coke formation and sintering. Coke formation can be inhibited through geometric separation, electron richness, poisoning acid sites, cofeeding streams, and enhancing oxygen mobility. Sintering can be prevented through the use of strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), encapsulation with oxides, carbon layers, or mesoporous materials, and fixation in zeolite crystals. These strategies aim to maintain the stability and activity of Pt-based catalysts during PDH processes.
5.Metal oxide-based catalysts for PDH processes can also suffer from deactivation due to coke formation and other factors. Strategies to inhibit deactivation include oxidation state manipulation, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites, and cofeeding streams. These approaches aim to improve the stability and selectivity of metal oxide-based catalysts during PDH processes.
