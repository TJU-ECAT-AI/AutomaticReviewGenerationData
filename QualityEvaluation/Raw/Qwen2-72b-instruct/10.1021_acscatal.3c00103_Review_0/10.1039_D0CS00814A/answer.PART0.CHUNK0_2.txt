1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a direct method for propylene production. PDH has received extensive attention in recent years as an important industrial technology. However, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and the subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging. Recent advances in the fundamental understandings of the PDH process include emerging technologies, catalyst development, and new chemistry in regulating catalyst structures and inhibiting catalyst deactivation. The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are proposed for further development.
