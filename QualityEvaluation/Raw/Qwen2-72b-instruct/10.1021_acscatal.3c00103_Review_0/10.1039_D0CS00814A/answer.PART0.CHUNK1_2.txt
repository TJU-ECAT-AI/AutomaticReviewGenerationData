[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
[2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
[3] "Although the catalysts recover most of their activity after each reactionregeneration cycle, the loss of activity due to the sintering in the regeneration process is not entirely reversible."
[4] "In addition, the alteration of surface composition and phase structure could induce catalyst deactivation."
[5] "According to the dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms over the specific active sites on metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, active, selective and stable catalysts are highly desired in the PDH process."
[6] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."
[7] "Therefore, in the next section, several advanced catalyst design strategies, such as alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, have been introduced."
[8] "Optimal design should rationally consider the aforementioned effects and maximize the benefits."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by developing advanced dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst design, and new chemistry. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include alloying/dealloying, single atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts. Optimal design should rationally consider the aforementioned effects and maximize the benefits.
