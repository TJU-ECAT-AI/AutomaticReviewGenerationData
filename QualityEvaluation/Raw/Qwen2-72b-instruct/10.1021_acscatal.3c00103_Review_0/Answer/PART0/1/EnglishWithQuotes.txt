{"Quotes": "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nAs previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nHu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).\nDealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.\nAlternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.\nJeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nIn view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.\nAlthough the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nIn summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.\nThe development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe most active catalyst, a Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalyst (with a TiO2 loading of 20 wt%) exhibited an initial STY of 86 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 14).\nThe enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.\nThe most active and stable catalyst, PtSn/B-ZrO2, achieved a STY of 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, that was attributed to the moderate surface acidity of B-ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2).\nThe role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.\nThe h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.\nThe addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2.\nThe economic aspects of ODH-O2 have not been analysed for C3H6 production. However, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 has been investigated extensively, and such an analysis is available.\nGaffney and Mason compared ODH-O2 of C2H6 with thermal cracking and showed that ODH-O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the plant capital costs and the overall cost of production.\nAlthough the reaction can proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step DDH + RWGS reaction, the net reaction is the same.\nA key competing reaction pathway in ODH-CO2 is dry reforming of propane (DRP) (Fig. 3), which can occur under the same conditions as ODH-CO2.\nThe reverse Boudouard reaction is also frequently reported to occur under typical reaction conditions.\nThe overall efficiency of the reaction will also depend on the catalyst, and if the above undesirable pathways can be sufficiently minimised.\nThe thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled.\nCareful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nThe cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.\nThe authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.\nGu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.\nSubsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.\nThe highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).\nThe combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.\nThe dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.\nThe acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity.\nThe V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.\nThis was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4).\nResults from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles.\nThe moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.\nVanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively.\nThe STY was calculated

co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support.\nHighly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.\nWhen tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.\nThe most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.\nThe STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.\nVOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results

catalysts reported.\nThe STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.\nThe most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.\nThe role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.\nThe range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.\nThe initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported.\nThe optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx.\nThe STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10).\nThe highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).\nThe STY was 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2).\nThe drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst.\nThe STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1).\nThe STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8).\nThe carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7).\nThe authors observed tuneable concentrations of the CO, OCO and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature.\nThe most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6).\nThe increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively.\nThe subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) caused the decomposition of the acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity.\nThe application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 also induced different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance as a result of more accessible active sites and favourable mass transport properties.\nThe most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.\nThe STY was 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).\nThe STY was 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.\nThe STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.\nThe STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking.\nThe highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the

have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of mesoporous supports with high surface area and pure γ-Al2O3 phase, which can be synthesized through the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). The crystallization temperature of the support directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. The optimal loading of vanadium (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which are crucial for catalytic activity. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retaining high activity after an 8 h DDH reaction. Mg modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% V loading reveals anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance, evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction. The highest space time yield (STY) achieved is 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The combined effect of surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitates desorption of propene and inhibits deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors. The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduce the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. Excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) sharply decreases acidity, leading to the loss of DDH activity.

The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004"},

These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.
