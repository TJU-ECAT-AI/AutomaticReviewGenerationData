Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of mesoporous supports with high surface area and pure Î³-Al2O3 phase, which can be synthesized through the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). The crystallization temperature of the support directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. The optimal loading of vanadium (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which are crucial for catalytic activity. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retaining high activity after an 8 h DDH reaction. Mg modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% V loading reveals anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance, evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction. The highest space time yield (STY) achieved is 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The combined effect of surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitates desorption of propene and inhibits deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors. The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduce the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. Excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) sharply decreases acidity, leading to the loss of DDH activity. The V/SiO2 catalyst (with a mass ratio of 1:12) displays optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C. This corresponds to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. Successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicate that the catalyst reaches a stable state, displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles. Moderate vanadium doping levels are conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibit an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91%, respectively. The STY is calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date. Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts enhances the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, contribute to high catalytic activity and stability. When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts display superior performance, highlighting the importance of preparation conditions and synthesis strategy in forming well-defined support structures and sufficient concentrations of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites. The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading), displays an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retains activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. The STY is 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increases from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C, with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponds to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work. The most active V species has been identified, and the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The role of other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear, and further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 times less active than the most active Pt catalysts. The initial performance of bulk ZrO2 corresponds to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported. The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in a patent by Exelus, inc. are very similar to those reported by Han et al., suggesting that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely based on ZnZrTiOx. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The drop in propane conversion is confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibits the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The authors observe tuneable concentrations of CO, OCO, and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The most active catalyst exhibits a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The increase in carbonization temperature positively influences the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7%, and 93.5%, respectively. The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) causes the decomposition of acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity. The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 induces different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance due to more accessible active sites and favorable mass transport properties. The STY of the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, increases from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C, with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponds to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work. The STY is 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites. The STY is 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY is 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, due to the low GHSV, so while the catalyst achieves high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it is not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts. The STY is 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion drops to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. A new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption is highly desired. This work develops a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM), using non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst, which opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, toxicity, and long-term coking and cracking. These catalysts also consume more energy under conventional reaction modes. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures to reduce energy consumption. Innovative catalyst design strategies include the use of CoSn/NC as a microwave catalyst, where cobalt serves as the active site, tin acts as a promoter to reduce deactivation by coking, and carbon nitride phase supports the catalyst. Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, and detrimental effects, and they suffer from coking and cracking over time.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. The literature does not provide information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, nor does it detail innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes. In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for on-purpose propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are considered promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding and controlling the surface structure of vanadium catalysts under reaction conditions to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. The presence of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, leading to better catalyst performance in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for propylene production.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. A new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption is highly desired. This work develops a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM), using non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst, which opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, toxicity, and long-term coking and cracking. These catalysts also consume more energy under conventional reaction modes. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures to reduce energy consumption. Innovative catalyst design strategies include the use of CoSn/NC as a microwave catalyst, where cobalt serves as the active site, tin acts as a promoter to reduce deactivation by coking, and carbon nitride phase supports the catalyst.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. The literature does not provide information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, nor does it detail innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

This opens a new route for the high-value utilization of abundant propane resources at low temperatures. Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, and detrimental effects, and are prone to coking and cracking over time. Moreover, the conventional reaction mode (CRM) for direct propane dehydrogenation consumes a significant amount of energy. To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to achieve direct propane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures, which can reduce energy consumption.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers.

These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. A new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption is highly desired. This work develops a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM), using non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst, which opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, toxicity, and long-term coking and cracking. These catalysts also consume more energy under conventional reaction modes. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures to reduce energy consumption. Innovative catalyst design strategies include the use of CoSn/NC as a microwave catalyst, where cobalt serves as the active site, tin acts as a promoter to reduce deactivation by coking, and carbon nitride phase supports the catalyst.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient.

However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. A new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption is highly desired. This work develops a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM), using non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst, which opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature. Traditional PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt have issues with cost, scarcity, toxicity, and long-term coking and cracking. These catalysts also consume more energy under conventional reaction modes. To address these challenges, researchers are developing new PDH methods that operate at lower temperatures to reduce energy consumption. Innovative catalyst design strategies include the use of CoSn/NC as a microwave catalyst, where cobalt serves as the active site, tin acts as a promoter to reduce deactivation by coking, and carbon nitride phase supports the catalyst. Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have prompted the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. The literature does not provide information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, nor does it detail innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic.

These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. The literature does not provide information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, nor does it detail innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

A novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM) has been developed, which uses non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, opening a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers.

These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for on-purpose propylene production.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative process to produce propylene from propane. PDH is an endothermic reaction that converts propane to propylene and hydrogen. The development of innovative catalyst design strategies is crucial to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts, alloy catalysts, and supported metal catalysts with tailored active sites to promote selective dehydrogenation while minimizing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Additionally, the development of robust catalysts that can withstand high temperatures and maintain activity over long periods is crucial for the commercial viability of PDH technologies. Strategies to overcome deactivation issues include the use of additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides, which can increase the robustness against coking. Moreover, the design of catalysts with optimal metal-support interactions, controlled particle size and shape, and the use of alloying elements can improve the stability and recyclability of the catalysts.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative method for propylene production. PDH processes, both oxidative and non-oxidative, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability of catalysts. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of V-based catalysts supported on mesoporous silica solids, are being explored to achieve these goals. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at different gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates the potential for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. PDH techniques provide an alternative method to produce propylene that avoids thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreases carbon deposition. V-based catalysts, which are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly, have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and have shown superior catalytic properties for PDH when supported on various materials such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3. The use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous Î³-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures demonstrates superior catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for the industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with optimized gelation and calcination temperatures has shown promising results in terms of catalytic activity, stability, and recyclability in non-oxidative PDH processes. The study of VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures reveals that the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH, with propane conversion showing a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4h reaction duration, while the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are considered one of the most promising and effective routes for the large-scale production of propylene. PDH has been successfully implemented in industry, but there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the issue of coke formation, which severely undermines the catalytic performance and stability of platinum (Pt) catalysts. To overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed, including the cofeeding of reductive gases like hydrogen with propane to significantly reduce coke formation, alloying Pt with second metals such as tin (Sn) for additional benefits, modifying supports to control coke formation, adjusting the size of the Pt catalyst to influence reactivity and side reactions, and exploring single Pt atom catalysts that reveal different mechanisms at the size limit. Computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have also been instrumental in understanding the deactivation mechanism and mapping out the complex reaction network of PDH. These strategies aim to improve the recyclability of catalysts in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes, addressing the challenges posed by increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH processes address these challenges by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.

The increasing demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods based on oil-based cracking processes, which are being challenged by changes in the global energy situation, are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. PDH techniques, particularly nonoxidative PDH, offer a promising alternative due to the price difference between propane and propylene. However, thermally induced deactivation remains a significant issue. To overcome this, substantial progress has been made in developing catalyst design strategies that focus on improving catalytic stability and recyclability. These strategies include active site regulation, enhancement of metal-support interaction, and support modification.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. These techniques address the challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For instance, the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) has been used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase. It was found that the crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability. Mg modification to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance. Innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts, such as the direct co-assembly process for vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs), which contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts was also investigated. Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. The nature of the support is an essential consideration in catalyst design, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. The relative proportion and stability of the most active V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, an industrially important platform chemical. Commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts have limitations due to the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need for ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration. An innovative method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO has been introduced. Supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C. The role of defective OH groups in the formation of active ZnOx species has been identified. The developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested under industrially relevant conditions, with the ZnO-based catalyst showing about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propene production that is not dependent on steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques can potentially lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation, making the process more energy-efficient. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported oxides of p-block metals for selective hydrogen combustion in redox mode, the design of solid oxygen carriers with high oxygen flux at dehydrogenation temperatures, and the creation of membrane reactors with high surface area and sufficient oxygen flux. The use of doped ceria as a solid oxygen carrier has shown promise for selective hydrogen combustion, and the efficiency of membrane reactors depends on the membrane type and geometry. The design of proton-conducting membrane fuel cell reactors for dehydrogenation of alkanes is also being explored, with the potential for cogeneration of alkenes, hydrogen, and electrical energy. However, the challenge of decreased propene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion over VOx catalysts remains, and the nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts. The design of efficient NiOx-based ODH catalysts is also being investigated, with the potential for electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. The use of homogeneous catalyst systems and enzyme-mimic sites in Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 may provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. However, the best catalytic performance of direct PDH catalysts based on Cr6 and Pt are either costly, scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term. Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM). To address these challenges, innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques as a promising alternative. PDH is an endothermic reaction that can be catalyzed by Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, typically performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor stability due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. To overcome these issues, researchers are developing innovative catalyst design strategies, including doping with additional promoters like late transition metals and main-group metals, and modifying carriers. These strategies aim to enhance stability, improve recyclability, and overcome deactivation issues in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined local structures to establish structure-reactivity relationships, the modification of acid-base properties of catalysts through alkali metal additives, and the control of the ratio of different oxygen sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of metal-oxide interfaces and the tuning of oxygen activity on oxides are explored to reduce the formation of byproducts and improve selectivity. The development of these catalysts is supported by computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling, which help in understanding the effects of geometrical and electronic structures on the activation of C-H bonds and in screening potential catalyst candidates.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by offering high propene selectivity and serving as one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2, which show industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. These catalysts can be optimized through phase composition and crystallite size, with the ability to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment being crucial for the creation of active sites. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be tuned by changing the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2, with smaller crystallite sizes and the monoclinic phase showing higher activity and selectivity to propene. The activity and selectivity to propene increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites, and monoclinic ZrO2 performs superior to tetragonal ZrO2. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on PDH performance are related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) that are responsible for propane activation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by converting propane, which is abundantly available from shale-gas deposits, into propene. Cobalt-based catalysts, due to their promising performance and the earth's abundance of cobalt, are being developed for PDH. An innovative catalyst design strategy involves the active site isolation strategy, which enhances catalytic performance in PDH. Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) have been synthesized through a two-step process, resulting in exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with high propane conversion and propene selectivity, and no apparent deactivation after 10 hours of PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

These strategies include the use of high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites as supports for ZnO catalysts, which have been shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts. The high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite, with good textural properties, well-defined structure, and well-adjusted acidity, is helpful for dispersing Zn species and reducing side reactions. Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites. The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 are low-cost, toxicity-free, and reusable, making them promising for industrial propylene production.

Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production. These techniques are particularly relevant in the context of the recent surge in shale gas production, which has made natural gas a more economical feedstock compared to crude oil. PDH processes, especially those using PtSn and CrOx catalysts, have been advanced to a point where they can be run continuously for several years, making them competitive with traditional methods. However, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Although alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides (GaOx, MoOx, VOx), have received significant attention, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition, and their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Further research is necessary to address these issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not have the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, is being explored as a promising alternative. In oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. O2 and CO2 are the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. O2 eliminates coke deposition, lowers the reaction temperature, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic, but it introduces the challenge of avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity. CO2, being a milder oxidant, can consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions without oxidizing the hydrocarbons, but it results in less heat formation, making the dehydrogenation reaction remain endothermic. The cofeeding of CO2 may lead to additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction, but it can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, affecting catalyst performance. Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for the development of an effective oxidative dehydrogenation system. Alternative solutions, such as the use of solid oxygen carriers (CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, BiO3) and noble metals (Pt, Au) for the selective hydrogen combustion, are being explored. However, these approaches require frequent regeneration of the metal oxide catalysts with oxygen, have relatively low reaction rates, and some of the metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for these approaches to become viable for industrial application.
