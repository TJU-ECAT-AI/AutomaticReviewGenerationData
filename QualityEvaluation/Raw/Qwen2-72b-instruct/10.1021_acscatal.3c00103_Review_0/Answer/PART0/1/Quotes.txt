The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.
In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.
The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.
The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
The most active catalyst, a Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalyst (with a TiO2 loading of 20 wt%) exhibited an initial STY of 86 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 14).
The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.
The most active and stable catalyst, PtSn/B-ZrO2, achieved a STY of 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, that was attributed to the moderate surface acidity of B-ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2).
The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.
The h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.
The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2.
The economic aspects of ODH-O2 have not been analysed for C3H6 production. However, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 has been investigated extensively, and such an analysis is available.
Gaffney and Mason compared ODH-O2 of C2H6 with thermal cracking and showed that ODH-O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the plant capital costs and the overall cost of production.
Although the reaction can proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step DDH + RWGS reaction, the net reaction is the same.
A key competing reaction pathway in ODH-CO2 is dry reforming of propane (DRP) (Fig. 3), which can occur under the same conditions as ODH-CO2.
The reverse Boudouard reaction is also frequently reported to occur under typical reaction conditions.
The overall efficiency of the reaction will also depend on the catalyst, and if the above undesirable pathways can be sufficiently minimised.
The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled.
Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.
The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).
The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.
The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity.
The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.
This was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4).
Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles.
The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.
Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively.
The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.
Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support.
Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.
The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.
The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.
VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).
The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.
This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.
The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.
The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.
The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported.
The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx.
The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10).
The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).
The STY was 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2).
The drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst.
The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1).
The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8).
The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7).
The authors observed tuneable concentrations of the CO, OCO and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature.
The most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6).
The increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively.
The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) caused the decomposition of the acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity.
The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 also induced different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance as a result of more accessible active sites and favourable mass transport properties.
The most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.
The STY was 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).
The STY was 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.
The STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking.
The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1.
The STY was 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 11).
The STY was 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7).
The STY was 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6).
The STY was 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."



[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
          [2] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ."
          [3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [4] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          [5] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."







[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry.

Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

          [27] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali ions has been shown to increase propene selectivity but at the expense of a decrease in propane conversion due to lower reducibility of the VOx or MoOx domain [143] ,[144] ."
          [28] "The extent of reduction of the VOx phase by an alkane influences alkene selectivity."
          [29] "The V3 + species was therefore considered either short-lived or non-existent during ODH of propane."
          [30] "The concentration of the O2 radicals increases during the reaction."
          [31] "Although the CH activation over VOx discussed thus far has V = O at its center, there are reports that contest whether V = O is the source of the active oxygen for CH activation and other catalytic reactions of supported MOx catalysts."
          [32] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity."
          [33] "The unprecedented selectivity of the VOx/MgAlO may be attributed to the heterolytic CH activation pathway, the reduction of V5 + to V3 + and the weak surface acidity of the catalyst."
          [34] "Water is a by-product in ODH, and in the presence of water the Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides regenerate and restore the favorable conditions for the V3 +/V5 + redox cycle."
          [35] "The redox property of NiOx is being investigated for use in the ODH of alkanes."
          [36] "Although the ODH of alkanes over NiOx-based catalysts has been explained using a parallel-consecutive reaction network and the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [169] , there are indications that the Ni-center directly participates in the CH activation step."
          [37] "Since electron-deficient late transition metal cations are electrophilic, direct participation of the Ni-center via electrophilic metalation cannot be ruled out."
          [38] "The lower selectivity with propane may be attributable to a higher propensity of propene for side reactions on acid sites of the catalyst surface."
          [39] "The reaction conditions are similar for propane and ethane, and the difference in reaction rate may be attributable to reaction compatibility of the CH of the alkanes to the active oxygen species."
          [40] "Rational design of an efficient NiOx-based ODH catalyst should first identify a compatible surface oxygen species and hydrogen species (proton, hydride or hydrogen atom) involved in CH activation, and then create a solid matrix that can selectively produce these species when exposed to molecular oxygen."
          [41] "The proposed mechanism of ODH over the Li/MgO catalyst does not involve removal of the catalyst lattice oxygen species, but instead CH activation leads to the formation of an alkyl radical."
          [42] "Product selectivity is thus largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry."
          [43] "Alkene selectivity increases with decreasing Lewis acidity of the metal ions ( Table 5 , entries 1, 7b & 7d vs. entries 2, 3, 4, 5, 7a & 7c)."

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."



[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
          [2] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ."
          [3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [4] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          [5] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."







[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

          [49] "Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts."
          [50] "Thus CH activation on heterogeneous catalysts can be a continuum from an electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, depending on the metal center and the surface oxygen species of ligands."

[1] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term.8 Moreover, the direct propane dehydrogenation reaction has higher energy consumption under conventional reaction mode (CRM)."

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."



[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
          [2] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ."
          [3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [4] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          [5] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."







[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."

          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."

          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."

[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

          [2] "Therefore, it is highly desired to exploit a new direct propane dehydrogenation method at low temperature that can reduce energy consumption."

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."



[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
          [2] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ."
          [3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [4] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          [5] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."







[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."

[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [4] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
          [5] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."







[1] "As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years."
          [2] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
          [5] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH."
          [6] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [7] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [9] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [10] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [11] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."
          [12] "A descriptor between the barrier of the CH bond activation and propylene desorption are proposed from several DFT studies."
          [13] "Moreover, the complex reaction network of PDH is also mapping out from DFT study."
          [14] "Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation."
          [15] "Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the CH bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on."
          [16] "However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis."
          [17] "Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation."
          [18] "In this Review, we are striving to give a concise and coherent description of coke formation on Pt catalysts in PDH from a comprehensive survey of literatures and provide the origin and nature of coke, which is scarcely discussed previously."
          [19] "The kinetic aspects of coke formation are also examined, which is also not covered in previous reviews."
          [20] "Moreover, the development and comparison of different methods to inhibit coke are elaborated."
          [21] "At the end, the catalyst regeneration and outlook for future improvements are supplied."
          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

          [38] "The lower selectivity with propane may be attributable to a higher propensity of propene for side reactions on acid sites of the catalyst surface."
          [39] "The reaction conditions are similar for propane and ethane, and the difference in reaction rate may be attributable to reaction compatibility of the CH of the alkanes to the active oxygen species."

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [22] "The current work can be a timely summary for the stability of the metal catalyst in catalytic conversion of short alkane molecules."



[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
          Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
          Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
          As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
          Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
          Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
          Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
          Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
          In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
          Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
          The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

[1] "The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts.329,330 Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative.331 The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures.277,289,292,332 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of Pt-based catalysts, generally by doping with additional promoters, such as late TMs and main-group metals (including Ga and Sn) and by modifying carriers.333,334 The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane generally follows the MVK mechanism,221,335,336 also known as the lattice oxygen mechanism. This mechanism holds that reactants with reducing properties react with highly reactive oxygen atoms in the catalyst surface to generate oxidation products and thus form oxygen vacancies on the surface. Then, followed by O2 or CO2 adsorption at the oxygen vacancy sites, the sites can be oxidized or filled with oxygen, forming a catalytic cycle. Besides, in order to break the thermodynamic limitations of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, an oxidant that is added to the reaction feed or system will react with the intermediate species hydrogen or the product H2 to produce water, releasing a large amount of heat.337,338 However, for the ODH of propane, the reaction products are easily oxidized to produce CO and CO2, so the reaction has to be carried out at a lower temperature in order to obtain a higher selectivity.339 Also, propane dehydrogenation is a kinetically controlled reaction, and the activation of the CH bond in propane is usually a rate-determining step, which requires the reaction at a higher temperature.340 Currently, in the PDH and ODH systems, the nature of the reaction mechanisms and reaction pathways on the catalysts remains elusive, and many side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, CC bond cleavage, H migration, and H2O formation also need to be taken into consideration."

          [3] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [4] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry.

Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
          [2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."

          [4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
          [5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
          [6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
          [7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
          [8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
          [9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
          [10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
          [11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
          [12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."



[1] "Although numerous metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydrogenation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a fundamental perspective."
          [2] "In this section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal oxide-based catalysts would be clarified."
          [3] "Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed atoms with different local environments is also diverse."
          [4] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions, undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
          [5] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models, which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers < 7) increases from 0.15 to 1 with metal particles shrinking from 10 to 1 nm."
          [6] "The Pt(111) surface consists of four different sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow."
          [7] "The different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt geometric sites."
          [8] "The adsorption of propane and propene was investigated on Pt(111) by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy."
          [9] "The 30202980 cm1 absorptions clearly arise from the ν(CH) modes of the CC group in the π-complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these species are present."
          [10] "Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+), which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conversion."
          [11] "A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong et al., who reported that the conversion of propane is up to 100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2, where Pt atoms have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms."
          [12] "However, it enhances the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt because the CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the CxHy group."
          [13] "Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene production but merely convert propane with excellence."
          [14] "Recently, Gong and coworkers showed that single-atom and electron-rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation barrier."
          [15] "Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure and electronic states can significantly influence the propylene adsorption and the potential side reactions."
          [16] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."
          [17] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
          [18] "And the intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking, as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking, contributing to the formation of side products like ethane, methane and coke."
          [19] "The first CH bond activation is still the rate-determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model showed, and the barriers for the initial CH cracking to yield 1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and 103.3 mol1, respectively."
          [20] "Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl species are 112.1 and 138.0 kJ mol1, respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propylene more favorable dynamically."
          [21] "Typically, the adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from the di-σ to π mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces."
          [22] "The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propylene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation product of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [23] "The authors utilized the free energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first or second CH bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling step."
          [24] "Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the difference between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to 1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity."
          [25] "Nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease with the increase of activity, as derived from the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship."
          [26] "Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation is coke formation."
          [27] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
          [28] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
          [29] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability."
          [30] "kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
          [31] "Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further help design more stable Pt-based catalysts."
          [32] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the catalytic performance."
          [33] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
          [34] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports, metals and treatments."
          [35] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
          [36] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
          [37] "As shown above, the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
          [38] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations."
          [39] "Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
          [40] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
          [41] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classified into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
          [42] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
          [43] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
          [44] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
          [45] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
          [46] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
          [47] "Additionally, tuning the support's acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
          [48] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
          [49] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
          [50] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
          [51] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH."
          [52] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
          [53] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
          [54] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC interactions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
          [55] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%."
          [56] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH)."
          [57] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
          [58] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogenation and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
          [59] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS), alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates, which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
          [60] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics, and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
          [61] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity."
          [62] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to Pt atoms."
          [63] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
          [64] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation; therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
          [65] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support."
          [66] "The samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
          [67] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
          [68] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
          [69] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
          [70] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
          [71] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface."
          [72] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio."
          [73] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
          [74] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
          [75] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
          [76] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
          [77] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
          [78] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent."
          [79] "Consequentially, the coke amount was significantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
          [80] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
          [81] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
          [82] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
          [83] "As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
          [84] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
          [85] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
          [86] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering, which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
          [87] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller particles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
          [88] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
          [89] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
          [90] "Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
          [91] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI."
          [92] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 C."
          [93] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images."
          [94] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
          [95] "Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between platinum and MXenes."
          [96] "The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [97] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
          [98] "The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable catalytic performances."
          [99] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 C."
          [100] "In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation."
          [101] "Compared with Al2O3 supports, a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protective effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs."
          [102] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
          [103] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm, and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4  1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
          [104] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
          [105] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
          [106] "High temperature oxidationreduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
          [107] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
          [108] "A similar situation occurred again."
          [109] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed."
          [110] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
          [111] "Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
          [112] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural transformation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
          [113] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
          [114] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
          [115] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
          [116] "Although many efforts have been made, further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."



[1] "Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations."
          [2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [3] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [4] "Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
          [5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
          [6] "Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."
          [7] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages."
          [8] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1))."
          [9] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
          [10] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
          [11] "However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
          [12] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction."
          [13] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."
          [14] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."
          [15] "In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
          [16] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
          [17] "Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion."
          [18] "Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen."
          [19] "Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic."
          [20] "These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."



Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation.
          The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.
          Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem.
          Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
          The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification.
