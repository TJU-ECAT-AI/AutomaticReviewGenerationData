          Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which offer an alternative route for propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are being explored as promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding the role of surface-bound hydroxyl groups, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, a major cause of deactivation. By tuning the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, it is possible to balance activity and stability, leading to enhanced recyclability and performance in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which have considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The literature also explores the effect of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which can improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. Innovative catalyst design strategies to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. The literature does not provide information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, nor does it detail innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The literature does not provide specific information on how propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. However, it does discuss the use of supported vanadium oxides as alternative catalysts for PDH, which can offer considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance. The study focuses on the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, showing that although these groups slightly suppress dehydrogenation activity, they improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition. This suggests that innovative catalyst design strategies, such as controlling the surface structure and the presence of hydroxyl groups, can help overcome deactivation issues and enhance stability in nonoxidative PDH processes. In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing an alternative route for on-purpose propylene production. Supported vanadium oxides are considered promising catalysts for PDH due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance. Innovative catalyst design strategies focus on understanding and controlling the surface structure of vanadium catalysts under reaction conditions to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability. The presence of surface-bound hydroxyl groups on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve stability by suppressing coke deposition, leading to better catalyst performance in nonoxidative PDH processes.

          工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性促使了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展，为丙烯生产提供了一条替代途径。由于其活性、选择性和再生性能，支持的钒氧化物正被探索为PDH的有希望的催化剂。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在理解表面结合的羟基团的作用上，这些羟基团可以通过抑制焦炭沉积来提高催化剂的稳定性，焦炭沉积是失活的主要原因。通过调整催化剂表面羟基团的覆盖度，可以平衡活性和稳定性，从而在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中提高可回收性和性能。文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了使用支撑的钒氧化物作为PDH的替代催化剂，这些催化剂具有相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和优异的再生性能。文献还探讨了表面结合的羟基对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的影响，它可以提高催化剂的稳定性，通过抑制焦炭沉积。在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善可回收性的创新催化剂设计策略在文献中没有明确提及。文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战的信息，也没有详细说明正在开发的创新催化剂设计策略，以克服失活问题，提高稳定性，并在氧化和非氧化PDH过程中提高可回收性。文献没有提供丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术如何解决工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了将支撑的钒氧化物作为PDH的替代催化剂,这可以提供相当的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和优异的再生性能。研究集中于表面羟基对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的影响,表明尽管这些基团轻微抑制脱氢活性,但它们通过抑制焦炭沉积提高了催化剂稳定性。这表明,创新的催化剂设计策略,如控制表面结构和羟基的存在,可以帮助克服非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题,增强稳定性。在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供丙烯的替代生产途径来应对这些挑战。由于其活性、选择性和再生性能，支持的钒氧化物被认为是PDH的有希望的催化剂。创新的催化剂设计策略集中在理解和控制反应条件下钒催化剂的表面结构，以克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性。在VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂上存在表面结合的羟基已被证明通过抑制焦炭沉积来提高稳定性，从而在非氧化PDH过程中获得更好的催化剂性能。
