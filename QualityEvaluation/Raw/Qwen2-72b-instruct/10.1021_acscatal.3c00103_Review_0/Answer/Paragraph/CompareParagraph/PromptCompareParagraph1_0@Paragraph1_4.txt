The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production has been significantly influenced by the development of innovative catalyst design strategies to address catalyst deactivation challenges \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. These strategies have been pivotal in enhancing stability and recyclability, particularly in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes. VOx-based catalysts have shown remarkable improvements through CADH for Al2O3, P and Mg modifications for stability, V/SiO2 for high propene yield, V-DMSNs for high STY, and VOx/ZrO2 for enhanced activity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. ZnO catalysts have also emerged as a viable alternative, tripling propene yield and addressing the toxicity and regeneration issues associated with Cr/Pt catalysts \[10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3\]. Innovations in PDH have not only focused on enhancing propene production but also on tackling the high temperature issues through the use of VOx, NiOx, and supported oxides, as well as membrane reactors and doped ceria for improved selectivity \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. The MVK mechanism, involving reactant-catalyst oxygen interaction, is central to oxidative PDH, and advanced design strategies have been developed to boost efficiency \[10.1039/D0CS01262A\]. 
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalyst design, particularly the VOx-based catalysts and the innovative ZnO catalysts, have opened new avenues for sustainable propylene production. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of single-atom, alloy, and supported metal catalysts to further minimize deactivation and coking, thereby enhancing stability and recyclability \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. The exploration of novel catalysts, such as those based on V-based catalysts on SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, could lead to the discovery of materials with superior stability and recyclability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.004\]. Moreover, the investigation of coke reduction strategies, including reductive gas, Pt-Sn alloy, support tweaks, Pt size control, and single atom catalysts, could significantly enhance the stability and recyclability of PDH catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\]. The use of HZSM-5/ZnO in PDH could also be a promising direction for enhancing stability and recyclability \[10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110508\]. The optimization of Cr Beta zeolites for CO2-PDH could further improve catalytic stability and efficiency \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. These directions could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable PDH processes, addressing the increasing industrial demand for propylene and aligning with the evolving global energy landscapes.

The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production has been significantly influenced by the development of innovative catalysts designed to address the challenges of deactivation, stability, and recyclability \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Catalysts such as VOx/Al2O3, optimized via CADH and P modification, have shown reduced VOx polymerization and enhanced anti-coking properties, while Mg modification further combats coking \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. VOx/SiO2 with moderate V doping has been found to boost propene yield \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\], and V-DMSNs have excelled in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2 and direct dehydrogenation (DDH) \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. VOx/ZrO2 has outperformed VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, with a high concentration of V3+ species, leading to space-time yields (STYs) ranging from 3.4 to 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].

                    PDH, as a vital process for propylene production, has seen advancements in catalysts such as ZnO, which offer three times higher productivity compared to traditional Cr/Pt catalysts, addressing issues of toxicity \[10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3\]. The use of ZnO catalysts in PDH not only triples propene productivity but also addresses deactivation issues \[10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3\]. These catalysts, formed via OH reactions at high temperatures, offer eco-friendliness and triple propene yield at similar selectivity, addressing limitations of traditional catalysts \[10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3\].

                    PDH's relevance in meeting the rising propylene demand, estimated to reach 130 million tonnes by 2023, has been underscored by the use of Cr-containing Beta zeolites, which enhance stability and recyclability in PDH and CO2-PDH processes \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. Dealumination impacts catalytic properties, with SiBeta's low acidity boosting propene selectivity above 80%, while AlBeta's high acidity promotes cracking \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\]. Redox Cr sites have been found to boost propene yield, with CO2 presence elevating propene formation over Cr-SiBeta \[10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalysts, particularly VOx-based catalysts, have significantly contributed to the enhancement of propylene production while addressing the challenges of deactivation, stability, and recyclability. The use of ZnO catalysts has not only addressed toxicity issues but also tripled propene productivity, highlighting their potential in the industry. The exploration of Cr-containing Beta zeolites has further expanded the horizons of PDH, offering enhanced stability and recyclability. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts, such as single-atom catalysts and alloy-based catalysts, which could potentially offer higher selectivity and stability. Additionally, the optimization of reaction conditions and the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of deactivation could lead to the design of catalysts with prolonged lifetimes and improved recyclability. The integration of PDH processes with renewable energy sources could also be a promising direction, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of propylene production and align with the evolving global energy landscapes.
