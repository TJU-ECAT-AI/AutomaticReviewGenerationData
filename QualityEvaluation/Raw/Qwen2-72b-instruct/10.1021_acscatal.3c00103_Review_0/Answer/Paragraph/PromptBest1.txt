The evolution of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a promising alternative for propylene production has been significantly influenced by the development of innovative catalyst design strategies aimed at addressing catalyst deactivation challenges \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. These strategies have been pivotal in enhancing stability and recyclability, particularly in the context of increasing industrial demand and changing global energy landscapes. Catalysts based on vanadium oxides (VOx) have shown remarkable potential, with VOx/Al2O3 optimized through co-assembly directed hydrothermal aging (CADH) to yield V3+ species, which are crucial for high propene selectivity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Phosphorus (P) modification has been effective in curbing VOx polymerization, while magnesium (Mg) modification has improved anti-coking properties, leading to a 1927% increase in propene yield \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. The use of vanadium on silica (V/SiO2) has also excelled, demonstrating high propene yield and stable selectivity \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Vanadium-doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) have achieved 18.1% propane conversion, 91% propene selectivity, and 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 space-time yield (STY) \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. VOx supported on zirconia (VOx/ZrO2) has shown five times higher activity than VOx/Al2O3, with a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\]. Preparation methods and support types have been found to be crucial for the performance of these catalysts \[10.1039/D1GC03700E\].
                    ※※※
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalyst design, particularly the use of vanadium-based catalysts, have opened up new avenues for enhancing propylene production while addressing the challenges of catalyst deactivation and stability. Future research efforts might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can further improve the selectivity and activity of PDH processes, potentially exploring the use of single-atom catalysts and alloying strategies to minimize coke formation and enhance recyclability. Additionally, the integration of PDH processes with renewable energy sources could offer a sustainable pathway for propylene production, aligning with the global shift towards cleaner and more efficient energy systems.
