[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]."
[2] "Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."
[4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [ 10 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ]."
[5] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [ 18 ,27 ,28 ]."
[6] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]."
[7] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."
[8] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr(III) has been suggested."
[9] "The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined."
[10] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[11] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[12] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene is being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which are gaining significance over time due to the growing demand for propene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of redox chromium species and high dispersion of chromium on supports like Beta zeolite, which has a three-dimensional structure, large pores, high thermal and acid stability, and a large specific surface area. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedures have been shown to give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. Redox cycles between oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), have been suggested in the oxidative pathway. The number of redox Cr sites has a significant impact on propene yield, and dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties, with low acidity of SiBeta suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene while high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

1.工业上对丙烯的需求日益增长，正在通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术来解决，这些技术由于丙烯需求的不断增长而变得越来越重要。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。这些策略包括使用红氧化铬物种和在像Beta沸石这样的支撑上高分散铬，这种沸石具有三维结构、大孔、高热和酸稳定性以及大比表面积。已经证明，Beta沸石的脱铝和随后通过简单的浸渍程序分散铬，可以为CO2-PDH提供优秀的催化剂。在氧化途径中，Cr位点的氧化/还原形式之间的红氧化循环，如Cr(III)/Cr(II)、Cr(VI)/Cr(III)或Cr(V)/Cr(III)，已经被提出。Cr红氧化位点的数量对丙烯产量有显著影响，脱铝对催化性能有重大影响，SiBeta的低酸性适合实现对丙烯的高选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta的高酸性促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。在丙烷脱氢在CO2存在和不存在的开关操作模式下，只有在含有CO2的Cr-SiBeta沸石催化剂上，丙烯的形成速率才会提高，而在Cr-AlBeta沸石催化剂上，丙烯形成速率则有负面影响。
