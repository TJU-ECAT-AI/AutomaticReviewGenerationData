1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. Innovative catalyst design strategies being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes include the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedures give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2wt % of Cr has been determined. Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst, while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed.

1.为了应对丙烯工业需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术应运而生。为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善循环利用性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，这些策略适用于氧化和非氧化PDH过程。其中包括使用含铬的Beta沸石催化剂。Beta沸石的脱铝和随后通过简单的浸渍程序进行的铬分散，为CO2-PDH提供了出色的催化剂。已经确定了Cr位点的还原数量与丙烯产量之间的良好相关性，直到Cr含量达到2wt%。将Cr含量相同(2wt%Cr)的Cr含Beta沸石催化剂在SiBeta和AlBeta上的催化活性进行比较，发现脱铝对催化性能有重大影响。SiBeta的低酸性适合获得高丙烯选择性(超过80%)，而AlBeta的高酸性会促进丙烷裂解为更轻的烃类。此外，在丙烷脱氢存在和不存在CO2的切换操作模式下，仅在Cr含SiBeta沸石催化剂上存在CO2时，丙烯的生成速率才会提高，而在Cr含AlBeta沸石催化剂上，CO2对丙烯生成速率有负面影响。

[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products. Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products. Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
[2] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]. We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术正在解决这些挑战。由于对丙烯的需求持续增长，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿吨，传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解方法已经不足以满足需求。优化这些过程以增加丙烯产量可能会对其他共产品的生产产生负面影响。因此，选择性过程如PDH、烯烃复分解和甲醇制丙烯（MTP）正在变得越来越重要。为了克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，例如使用含铬的Beta沸石。Beta沸石具有三维结构、大孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，非常适合高铬物种的分散。Beta沸石的脱铝化，随后通过浸渍分散铬，已被证明是生产CO2辅助PDH的优秀催化剂。

Moreover, the promoting effect of CO2 on propylene formation was observed over Cr2.0SiBeta. On this dealuminated form of Beta zeolite, both the yield and selectivity to propene rise in the presence of CO2. In contrast, over Cr2.0AlBeta zeolite catalyst, CO2 exerts a negative effect, similar to the poisoning effect observed over γ-Al2O3-based chromium oxide catalysts.
