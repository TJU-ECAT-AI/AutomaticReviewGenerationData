[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses. Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [ 1 ]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products. Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products. Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synthesis, such as propane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and propene synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain significance with time."
[2] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion [ [33] ,[34] ,[35] ]. We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods are being addressed by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques. As the demand for propene continues to grow, reaching an estimated 130 million tonnes by 2023, traditional sources like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are insufficient. Optimizing these processes to increase propene production could negatively impact the production of other co-products. Therefore, selective processes like PDH, olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propene (MTP) are gaining importance. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of chromium-containing Beta zeolites, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Beta zeolites, with their three-dimensional structure, large pore size, high thermal and acid stability, and large specific surface area, are ideal for high chromium species dispersion. Dealumination of Beta zeolites followed by chromium dispersion through impregnation has been shown to produce excellent catalysts for CO2-assisted PDH.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术正在解决这些挑战。由于对丙烯的需求持续增长，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿吨，传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解方法已经不足以满足需求。优化这些过程以增加丙烯产量可能会对其他共产品的生产产生负面影响。因此，选择性过程如PDH、烯烃复分解和甲醇制丙烯（MTP）正在变得越来越重要。为了克服失活问题、增强稳定性和提高可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，例如使用含铬的Beta沸石。Beta沸石具有三维结构、大孔径、高热稳定性和酸稳定性以及大比表面积，非常适合高铬物种的分散。Beta沸石的脱铝化，随后通过浸渍分散铬，已被证明是生产CO2辅助PDH的优秀催化剂。
