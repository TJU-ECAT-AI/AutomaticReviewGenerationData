[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[3] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[4] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."
[5] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[6] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[7] "The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[8] "The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity."
[9] "The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[10] "The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species."
[11] "Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[12] "When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites."
[13] "The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts."
[14] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[15] "The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites."
[16] "VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2)."
[17] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[18] "For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C."
[19] "This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported."
[20] "The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work."
[21] "The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[22] "The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[23] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."
[24] "The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported."
[25] "The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx."
[26] "The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1)."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route to produce propylene. These techniques involve the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propylene, which can be done either non-oxidatively or oxidatively. Non-oxidative PDH, also known as direct dehydrogenation (DDH), involves the removal of hydrogen from propane in the absence of an oxidant, while oxidative PDH (ODH) involves the removal of hydrogen in the presence of an oxidant, typically oxygen. The DDH process is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction, which favors the formation of hydrogen and propylene at high temperatures. However, the ODH process can overcome this limitation by utilizing the exothermic nature of the reaction to drive the reaction towards the formation of propylene.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadia-based catalysts, which have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions. The use of supports, such as silica, alumina, and zeolites, can help to stabilize the active metal oxide species and prevent their agglomeration, which can lead to deactivation. The use of promoters, such as phosphorus and magnesium, can also help to enhance the stability and recyclability of the catalysts by reducing the formation of coke and other by-products. Additionally, the use of novel synthesis methods, such as sol-gel and hydrothermal methods, can help to improve the dispersion and stability of the active metal oxide species on the support, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
3.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, PDH techniques offer a promising alternative route to produce propylene. However, the development of stable and recyclable catalysts is crucial for the commercial success of these techniques. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of supported metal oxide catalysts, promoters, and novel synthesis methods, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过从丙烷中去除氢来生产丙烯，以应对工业对丙烯日益增长的需求和传统生产方法的局限性。这些技术可以非氧化性或氧化性的方式进行。非氧化性PDH，也称为直接脱氢(DDH)，在没有氧化剂的情况下从丙烷中去除氢，而氧化性PDH(ODH)在氧化剂，通常是氧气的存在下去除氢。DDH过程受反应热力学平衡的限制，该平衡在高温下倾向于形成氢和丙烯。然而，ODH过程可以通过利用反应的放热性质来克服这一限制，推动反应向丙烯的形成方向进行。
2.为了克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，用于氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程。这些策略包括使用金属氧化物催化剂，如基于钒的催化剂，这些催化剂已被证明在PDH反应中具有高活性和选择性。使用载体，如二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石，可以帮助稳定活性金属氧化物物种，防止其聚结，这可能导致失活。使用促进剂，如磷和镁，也可以通过减少焦炭和其他副产品的形成来增强催化剂的稳定性和可回收性。此外，使用溶胶-凝胶和水热等新型合成方法，可以帮助改善活性金属氧化物物种在载体上的分散和稳定性，从而提高催化性能。
3.在工业对丙烯需求日益增长和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，PDH技术提供了一种有希望的替代路线来生产丙烯。然而，稳定和可回收催化剂的开发对于这些技术的商业成功至关重要。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，如使用金属氧化物催化剂、促进剂和新型合成方法，以克服失活问题，提高稳定性和改善氧化性和非氧化性PDH过程的可回收性。
