[1] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[2] "The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections."
[3] "The most active catalyst, a Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalyst (with a TiO2 loading of 20 wt%) exhibited an initial STY of 86 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 14)."
[4] "The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt."
[5] "The most active and stable catalyst, PtSn/B-ZrO2, achieved a STY of 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, that was attributed to the moderate surface acidity of B-ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2)."
[6] "The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity."
[7] "The h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."
[8] "The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2."
[9] "The economic aspects of ODH-O2 have not been analysed for C3H6 production. However, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 has been investigated extensively, and such an analysis is available."
[10] "Gaffney and Mason compared ODH-O2 of C2H6 with thermal cracking and showed that ODH-O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the plant capital costs and the overall cost of production."
[11] "Although the reaction can proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step DDH + RWGS reaction, the net reaction is the same."
[12] "A key competing reaction pathway in ODH-CO2 is dry reforming of propane (DRP) (Fig. 3), which can occur under the same conditions as ODH-CO2."
[13] "The reverse Boudouard reaction is also frequently reported to occur under typical reaction conditions."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene. These techniques are considered more environmentally friendly due to their higher atom economy and the potential to utilize renewable feedstocks. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of promoters, the selection of appropriate supports, and the control of the catalyst preparation method to optimize the dispersion and stability of the active sites. The development of an active, selective, and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near- and long-term future. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of the side-reactions that lead to deactivation and reduce the efficiency of the process.
