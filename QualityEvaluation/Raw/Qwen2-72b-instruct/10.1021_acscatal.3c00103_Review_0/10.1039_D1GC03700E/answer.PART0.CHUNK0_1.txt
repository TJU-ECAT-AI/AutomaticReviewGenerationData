[5] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
[6] "Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts."
[7] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
[8] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."
[9] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a more sustainable and potentially more efficient route to propylene production. The development of active, selective, and stable catalysts is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include focusing on more abundant chemical elements for catalysts, prioritizing research on the low-temperature activation of CO2, and improving the selectivity of catalysts to propene. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation has gained interest due to environmental advantages, but current ODH-CO2 catalysts have lower activity levels than DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods, and future catalyst design should aim to improve selectivity in DDH and ODH-O2, while ODH-CO2 catalysts need to overcome their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2.
