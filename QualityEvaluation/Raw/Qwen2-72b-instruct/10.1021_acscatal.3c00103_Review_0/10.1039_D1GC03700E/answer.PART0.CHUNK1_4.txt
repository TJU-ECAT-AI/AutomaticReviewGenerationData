[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[3] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[4] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."
[5] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[6] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[7] "The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[8] "The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity."
[9] "The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[10] "The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species."
[11] "Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[12] "When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites."
[13] "The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts."
[14] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[15] "The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites."
[16] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[17] "The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work."
[18] "The most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."
[19] "The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported."
[20] "The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10)."
[21] "The STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking."
[22] "The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12)."
[23] "The Zn was present exclusively as isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+Ox. This catalyst produced a STY of 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2)."
[24] "The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx."
[25] "The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1)."
[26] "The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8)."
[27] "The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7)."
[28] "The STY of the most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6)."
[29] "The STY was 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 8, entry 6)."
[30] "The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6)."
[31] "The h-BN/cordierite material was prepared by the chemical vapour deposition process. The geometry of the support was essential in this case, as well as the support forming strong oxygen bridge bonds with the catalytic phase."
[32] "The STY of 82 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 6) was measured over V/SiO2 prepared via SOMC."
[33] "The one step synthesis, similar to the VZrOx catalysts discussed previously, led to higher dispersion and a higher stability of vanadia on the DMSN support when compared to incipient wetness impregnation (denoted V/DMSN)."
[34] "A surface V density of 0.55 V nm2 (2 wt% V), gave the highest STY of 9.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 5)."
[35] "The STY of the Na+ promoted V/SiO2 was sustained for 4.5 days and post-reaction Raman spectroscopy showed no formation of 3D V2O5 crystallites."
[36] "The STY of 110 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 1), which is 7 times greater than the analogous V/SiO2 materials tested."
[37] "The STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 3), which represented an improved productivity over BN-OH catalysts that had been previously described in the literature."
[38] "The STY of 48 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 7) and subsequent stability tests at 545 C showed that a propane conversion of 20% and propene selectivity of 80% could be maintained over the 100 h experiment."
[39] "The STY of 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6)."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of CADH for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, which directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The crystallization temperature of the support affects the distribution of different surface V species, and the optimal loading of V (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species. P modification decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retention of high activity. Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites increases active V3+ species, reducing the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. The dispersing action of Mg modification also reduces the acidity, which can lead to the loss of DDH activity with excessive Mg addition. The V/SiO2 catalyst with a mass ratio of 1:12 displays optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield and stable propene selectivity. Moderate vanadium doping levels are conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species without V2O5 crystallites are conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. The preparation conditions and synthesis strategy are important for the formation of well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites. The STY of the most active catalysts is around 34 times less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供替代路线来生产丙烯，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的问题。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性和可回收性。这些策略包括使用CADH合成具有高表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3，这直接影响VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能。支撑材料的结晶温度影响不同表面V物种的分布，V的最佳负载量(12 wt%)导致大量孤立的V3+物种。P改性降低了VOx聚合度，提高了催化剂的稳定性和高活性的保持。Mg改性至V2O5晶粒增加了活性V3+物种，减少了焦炭沉积的量和聚合度。Mg改性的分散作用也降低了酸性，过量的Mg添加会导致DDH活性的丧失。V/SiO2催化剂(质量比为1:12)显示出最佳的催化性能，实现了优越的初始丙烯产率和稳定的丙烯选择性。适度的钒掺杂水平有利于以孤立和低聚合VOx物种的形式形成高度分散的钒物种。高度分散和稳定的VOx物种，没有V2O5晶粒，有利于高催化活性和稳定性。制备条件和合成策略对于形成支撑材料的明确定义结构和足够浓度的高度分散和孤立的VO4活性位点至关重要。最活跃催化剂的STY大约是活性最高的Pt催化剂的34倍。ZrO2的初始性能对应于STY为64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这是报告的最高非Pt值之一。CuZrOx催化剂的STY为26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，与未改性催化剂的22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1相比。ZnO纳米簇在脱铝沸石-β中支撑的STY为4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，在6 h的在线时间后，由于焦化，转化率降至40%。最高STY产量是在10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5上观察到的，SiO2:Al2O3的摩尔比为280，产生6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Zn以孤立的三配位Zn2+Ox形式存在，最活跃的催化剂产生550 C时STY为55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Zn，Zr和Ti氧化物的最优负载和配方与Han等人报告的非常相似，因此我们暂时认为K-PRO过程中的催化剂可能基于ZnZrTiOx。Pd3Fe催化剂的STY为32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Ni3Ga/Al2O3催化剂的STY为6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。在700 C下用KOH活化的碳催化剂表现出最佳的催化活性，显示出初始丙烯产率为36.6%，STY为4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。最活跃催化剂的STY为3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。通过SOMC制备的V/SiO2的STY为82 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。一步合成导致与浸渍法相比，在DMSN支撑上具有更高的分散性和更高的稳定性。表面V密度为0.55 V nm2(2 wt% V)给出了最高的STY为9.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。Na+促进的V/SiO2的STY持续了4.5天，而反应后的拉曼光谱显示没有形成3D V2O5晶粒。BNNT的STY为110 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这是测试的类似V/SiO2材料的7倍。元素硼的STY为280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这代表了与BN-OH催化剂相比，生产力的提高。SiB6的STY为48 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，随后在545 C的稳定性测试表明，在100 h的实验中，丙烷转化率为20%，丙烯选择性为80%。多孔BPO4的STY为320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。h-BN/cordierite材料通过化学气相沉积过程制备，支撑材料的几何形状是至关重要的，以及支撑材料与催化相形成强氧桥键。通过SOMC制备的V/SiO2的STY为82 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。一步合成导致与浸渍法相比，在DMSN支撑上具有更高的分散性和更高的稳定性。表面V密度为0.55 V nm2(2 wt% V)给出了最高的STY为9.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。Na+促进的V/SiO2的STY持续了4.5天，而反应后的拉曼光谱显示没有形成3D V2O5晶粒。BNNT的STY为110 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这是测试的类似V/SiO2材料的7倍。元素硼的STY为280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，这代表了与BN-OH催化剂相比，生产力的提高。SiB6的STY为48 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，随后在545 C的稳定性测试表明，在100 h的实验中，丙烷转化率为20%，丙烯选择性为80%。多孔BPO4的STY为320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。其他ODH-O2催化剂的STY范围从2.0 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1到79 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1。
