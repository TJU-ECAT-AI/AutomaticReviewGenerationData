The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C).
Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx.
Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species.
Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.

In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.
The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions. Under these oxidative conditions, the surface area increased from 8.9 m2 g1 to 78.1 m2 g1, due to the formation of mesopores at the surface. The large increase in surface area when compared to the starting material, was a large factor in obtaining the high activity.
The activity and selectivity were much higher for PtSn/SAPO-34  a yield of 72.4% as compared to a 1015% yield for most V based catalysts. Introducing oxygen into the feed also reduced the formation of coke, which is a feature of instability in DDH. Water formed via ODH-O2 was found to reduce stability, by increasing sintering of Pt due to a weaker metalsupport interaction.
The role of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts.
Despite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260 The enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene.
The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction. In considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10.
The enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration. Consequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr.
The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.
The stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts.
The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst. Using NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity. These acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke.
The catalysts were relatively stable on-stream over 20 h, retaining 80% of their initial activity. Despite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12).
The catalyst exhibited a low STY of 6.8 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 5). Despite this, the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst shows potential to surpass the more commonly researched Fe-zeolites in terms of stability. Whereas previous examples of Fe-zeolites have displayed significant deactivation over 3 h time-on-stream, this In-based catalyst was observed to lose 6% propene yield over a total of 12 h on stream.

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing alternative routes to produce propylene from propane. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Ni-based catalysts, particularly NiO-CeO2, have shown promise in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH-O2). Mo-based catalysts also feature prominently, but their propene selectivity is limited. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibits high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximize performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst. The use of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in ODH-O2 has shown higher activity and selectivity compared to vanadia-based catalysts, and introducing oxygen into the feed reduces the formation of coke. In ODH-CO2, Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibits high activity, while Cr2O3/AC shows enhanced activity in the presence of CO2 at higher temperatures. Dealuminated Cr-β-zeolite catalysts have shown improved stability compared to CrAlbeta. Ni-promoted Cr catalysts have shown enhanced stability, but aggregation of Cr species is suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism. Chromium-based catalysts generally exhibit poor on-stream stability, but incremental improvements in activity have been reported. ZnO/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown improved stability in the presence of CO2 compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts. Spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides have shown low coking rates and enhanced stability due to weak Lewis acid sites. FeCeO2 catalysts have shown relatively good stability on-stream, retaining 80% of their initial activity. In2O3Al2O3 catalysts have shown potential for high stability, losing only 6% propene yield over 12 h on-stream.

The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.
The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
The most active catalyst, a Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalyst (with a TiO2 loading of 20 wt%) exhibited an initial STY of 86 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 14).
The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt.
The most active and stable catalyst, PtSn/B-ZrO2, achieved a STY of 13 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, that was attributed to the moderate surface acidity of B-ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2).
The role of Cu in the catalyst was to dilute the Pt species and promote desorption of propene, thereby enhancing selectivity.
The h-BN nanosheets provided abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects that are associated with unpaired electrons, which strongly interact with active metal species, helping to strengthen the interaction between the metal and support.
The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2.
The economic aspects of ODH-O2 have not been analysed for C3H6 production. However, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 has been investigated extensively, and such an analysis is available.
Gaffney and Mason compared ODH-O2 of C2H6 with thermal cracking and showed that ODH-O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the plant capital costs and the overall cost of production.
Although the reaction can proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step DDH + RWGS reaction, the net reaction is the same.
A key competing reaction pathway in ODH-CO2 is dry reforming of propane (DRP) (Fig. 3), which can occur under the same conditions as ODH-CO2.
The reverse Boudouard reaction is also frequently reported to occur under typical reaction conditions.
The overall efficiency of the reaction will also depend on the catalyst, and if the above undesirable pathways can be sufficiently minimised.
The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled.
Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.
The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).
The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.
The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity.
The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.
This was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4).
Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles.
The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.
Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively.
The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.
Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support.
Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.
The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.
The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.
VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).
The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.
This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.
The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.
The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.
The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported.
The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx.
The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10).
The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).
The STY was 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2).
The drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst.
The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1).
The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8).
The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7).
The authors observed tuneable concentrations of the CO, OCO and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature.
The most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6).
The increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively.
The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) caused the decomposition of the acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity.
The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 also induced different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance as a result of more accessible active sites and favourable mass transport properties.
The most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.
The STY was 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).
The STY was 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.
The STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking.
The STY was 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 11).
The STY was 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7).
The STY was 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6).
The STY was 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of mesoporous supports with high surface area and pure γ-Al2O3 phase, which can be synthesized through the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). The crystallization temperature of the support directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. The optimal loading of vanadium (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which are crucial for catalytic activity. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retaining high activity after an 8 h DDH reaction. Mg modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% V loading reveals anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance, evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction. The highest space time yield (STY) achieved is 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1.

The initial performance of bulk ZrO2 corresponds to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported. The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in a patent by Exelus, inc. are very similar to those reported by Han et al., suggesting that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely based on ZnZrTiOx. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The drop in propane conversion is confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibits the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The authors observe tuneable concentrations of CO, OCO, and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The most active catalyst exhibits a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The increase in carbonization temperature positively influences the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7%, and 93.5%, respectively. The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) causes the decomposition of acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity. The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 induces different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance due to more accessible active sites and favorable mass transport properties. The STY of the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, increases from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C, with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponds to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work. The STY is 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites. The STY is 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY is 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, due to the low GHSV, so while the catalyst achieves high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it is not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts. The STY is 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion drops to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.

The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future.
The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements.
Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority.
With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.
The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2.
Although this is an attractive prospect with considerable potential, the propene yields reported over these catalysts are an order of magnitude lower than the most active DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts.
Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application.
The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance.
Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2.

In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing a more sustainable and potentially more efficient route to propylene production. The development of active, selective, and stable catalysts is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered a viable process in the near and long-term future. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include focusing on more abundant chemical elements for catalysts, prioritizing research on the low-temperature activation of CO2, and improving the selectivity of catalysts to propene. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation has gained interest due to environmental advantages, but current ODH-CO2 catalysts have lower activity levels than DDH and ODH-O2 catalysts. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for all dehydrogenation methods, and future catalyst design should aim to improve selectivity in DDH and ODH-O2, while ODH-CO2 catalysts need to overcome their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2.

In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.
In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application.
In summary, while the ODH-N2O reaction is hindered significantly by its tendency to deactivate rapidly without the presence of O2, Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst is very resistant to deactivation and its use for the ODH-N2O reaction is contingent on several factors.
In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported.
The ODH-O2 catalysts on the other hand are generally much more stable on-stream.
In summary, although Fe-ZSM-5 has the most potential for the ODH-N2O reaction for propane, several other catalysts have been tested. Vanadia based catalysts have been shown to be highly active for the reaction, which were found to be more selective when supported on less acidic, silica-based support materials, and at loading levels of lower than 5 wt%.
The ability of Cr to catalyse multiple sub-reactions is likely to be related to its stability (and activity) in multiple valence states.
Aside from the active element, catalyst supports also comprise a vital component of any propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase.
A multitude of chemical elements including precious metals, rare earth metals, base metals and non-metals have all been discovered to play a role in catalysing propane dehydrogenation in various contexts.
In the DDH reaction, the most active elements are typically Pt and Cr, which are already implemented in commercial processes, and more recently Zr and Zn-based alternatives have been used.
The ODH-O2 reaction has recently been dominated by the discovery of boron-based catalysts, which are highly abundant compared to most other ODH-O2 catalysts such as V.
ODH-CO2 catalysts are typically Cr or Ga based.
The field of research into DDH and ODH-O2 is very diverse, and in recent years a number of novel discoveries has expanded the range of catalytically active elements known for this reaction.
Future sustainable DDH and ODH-O2 processes should capitalise on this knowledge and implement abundant elements such as B, Zn, V or Zr.
With regards to ODH-CO2, the performance of the most active catalysts is still well below what would be considered for commercialisation, but the research community should look to the successes of the abovementioned abundant elements for inspiration in designing novel ODH-CO2 catalysts.

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative routes to produce propylene. These techniques include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DDH). ODH processes, such as ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2, utilize oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants to facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane, which can potentially reduce the formation of coke and improve the selectivity to propylene. DDH processes, on the other hand, involve the direct dehydrogenation of propane without the use of an oxidant. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For instance, in ODH-O2, boron-based catalysts have shown exceptional performance with high space-time yields, making them promising for commercial application. In ODH-CO2, while the catalysts are not as active as those for ODH-O2, research is ongoing to improve catalyst performance. In DDH, efforts are focused on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking and improving the selectivity to propylene. Catalysts based on elements like boron, zinc, vanadium, and zirconium are being explored for their abundance and potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
In addition to alumina, other supports have been investigated. Earlier reports by Ovsitser et al. described a silica supported VOx catalyst which exhibited high propene yield (86%), high stability and minimal deactivation over a 20 h DDH reaction.144 Hu et al. explored vanadium doped porous silica (VSiO2) with varying V:Si mass ratios of vanadium to silicon of 1:24, 1:12, 1:6, and 1:3, respectively.145 The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.
The concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions.
Zhang and Liu187 also investigated VMgO catalysts with the aim of increasing the loading whilst maintaining a high level of dispersion on SBA-15, which has previously been show V2O5 crystallite formation even at low loading levels. To limit agglomeration of vanadia, co-impregnation of V and Mg was undertaken which resulted in the suppression of 3D V2O5 crystallite formation.
The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield.
The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies and loadings when compared to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques.
The preparation route of Al2O3 was varied to form flower-like, sphere-like and bulk-like morphologies to investigate the influence of varying porosities. Bulk-like morphology only exhibited intraparticle pores, and the monolithic architecture of γ-Al2O3 (formed by a roasting method) achieved the highest productivity for ODH-O2, despite the surface vanadia species being consistent across all architectures, with the degree of polymerisation being fairly similar for all Al2O3 structures as (shown by adsorption edge energy analysis).
Mesoporosity was also explored when forming fibrous vanadia catalysts via electrospinning. A comparison between fibrous catalysts which presented mesoporosity, and particle-like catalysts without apparent mesoporosity, indicated no influence on catalytic performance due to porosity,192 consistent with the aforementioned morphology analysis.
A h-BN/cordierite monolithic catalyst exhibited a productivity increase of 55% when compared to elemental B. This is among the most active B catalysts reported to date. It was shown that optimising conditions for a high WHSV can lower CO2 selectivity to 0%, which impressive even by the standards of h-BN catalysts.
When comparing macroporous BPO4 to bulk BPO4, it was found that the macroporous structure increased the performance significantly. The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6).211 When using the same WHSV, macroporous BPO4 exhibited three-times the conversion of bulk BPO4 despite being tested at a 30 C lower temperature, whilst achieving roughly the same product distribution.

The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application. As a relatively stable, non-hazardous and abundant element, boron catalysts may well play a major role in future propene production processes. Furthermore, they appear to be stable on-stream in laboratory tests, although industrially relevant stability tests have not yet been reported.
In ODH-CO2, CrOx based catalysts yield the highest STY, but only incremental advances have been made in recent years and it will take a step-change in catalyst development before ODH-CO2 can be meaningfully compared to DDH and ODH-O2 reactions, as a mean to produce propene.
In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported. ODH-N2O is the least studied sub-reaction and it is thought that the relatively high cost and low availability of N2O may be the most limiting aspect.
The ability of Cr to catalyse multiple sub-reactions is likely to be related to its stability (and activity) in multiple valence states. In DDH, Cr3+ sites are considered the active species, while in ODH-CO2 and ODH-O2, the redox cycle of Cr to Cr4+ and Cr3+ all facilitate the activation of the oxidant.
The role of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts.
The majority of investigations thus far have focussed on Ga- or Cr-based catalysts and improvement in these catalysts has been incremental. Supported nanoparticles on the other hand, have received little attention despite showing some promising results.
In terms of side-reactions, cracking is the only common source of by-products in each sub-reaction. Coking remains a major challenge in DDH, ODH-CO2 and ODH-N2O, while overoxidation is generally observed in the ODH-O2 and ODH-N2O processes.
In summary, while the ODH-N2O reaction is hindered significantly by its tendency to deactivate rapidly without the presence of O2, Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst is very resistant to deactivation and its use for the ODH-N2O reaction is contingent on several factors.

This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.
The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).
The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.
The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity.
The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.
The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.
Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.
The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.
The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.
The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.
VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).
The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species.
For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C.
This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported.
The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.
The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method.
The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts.
The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.
The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported.
The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx.
The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1).
The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10).
The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing an alternative route to produce propylene. These techniques involve the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propylene, which can be done either non-oxidatively or oxidatively. Non-oxidative PDH, also known as direct dehydrogenation (DDH), involves the removal of hydrogen from propane in the absence of an oxidant, while oxidative PDH (ODH) involves the removal of hydrogen in the presence of an oxidant, typically oxygen. The DDH process is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction, which favors the formation of hydrogen and propylene at high temperatures. However, the ODH process can overcome this limitation by utilizing the exothermic nature of the reaction to drive the reaction towards the formation of propylene.
2.Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of supported metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadia-based catalysts, which have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity for PDH reactions. The use of supports, such as silica, alumina, and zeolites, can help to stabilize the active metal oxide species and prevent their agglomeration, which can lead to deactivation. The use of promoters, such as phosphorus and magnesium, can also help to enhance the stability and recyclability of the catalysts by reducing the formation of coke and other by-products. Additionally, the use of novel synthesis methods, such as sol-gel and hydrothermal methods, can help to improve the dispersion and stability of the active metal oxide species on the support, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
3.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, PDH techniques offer a promising alternative route to produce propylene. However, the development of stable and recyclable catalysts is crucial for the commercial success of these techniques. Innovative catalyst design strategies, such as the use of supported metal oxide catalysts, promoters, and novel synthesis methods, are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes.

In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.
In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application.
The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application. As a relatively stable, non-hazardous and abundant element, boron catalysts may well play a major role in future propene production processes. Furthermore, they appear to be stable on-stream in laboratory tests, although industrially relevant stability tests have not yet been reported.
In ODH-CO2, CrOx based catalysts yield the highest STY, but only incremental advances have been made in recent years and it will take a step-change in catalyst development before ODH-CO2 can be meaningfully compared to DDH and ODH-O2 reactions, as a mean to produce propene.
In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported. ODH-N2O is the least studied sub-reaction and it is thought that the relatively high cost and low availability of N2O may be the most limiting aspect.
The most promising materials currently are steamed Fe-ZSM-5, as the steam treatment has been found to produce more Fe2+ sites and dealuminate the framework, causing an increase in weak and medium acid sites. With fewer strong protonic sites, the reaction mechanism shifts towards favouring the dehydrogenation of propane, therefore resulting in a consecutive propane dehydrogenation-propene cracking pathway which allows for a higher selectivity to propene with shorter contact times.
In summary, although Fe-ZSM-5 has the most potential for the ODH-N2O reaction for propane, several other catalysts have been tested. Vanadia based catalysts have been shown to be highly active for the reaction, which were found to be more selective when supported on less acidic, silica-based support materials, and at loading levels of lower than 5 wt%. Indium based catalysts have also been suggested for the ODH-N2O reaction, with the potential for a highly stable catalyst compared to Fe-ZSM-5, which displays significant deactivation and is likely to be the underlying reason behind the relatively low research effort put into the N2O route compared to the other potential oxidants described in this review article.

The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.
At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene.
Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application.
Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2.
The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements.
Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority.
With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.

The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species.
The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.
The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).
The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.
The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits.
The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity.
The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C.
The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.
Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability.
When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.

The STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking.
The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).
The Zn was present exclusively as isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+Ox. This catalyst produced a STY of 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2).

The STY was 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 8, entry 6).
The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6).
The h-BN/cordierite material was prepared by the chemical vapour deposition process. The geometry of the support was essential in this case, as well as the support forming strong oxygen bridge bonds with the catalytic phase.
The STY of 82 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 6) was measured over V/SiO2 prepared via SOMC.
The one step synthesis, similar to the VZrOx catalysts discussed previously, led to higher dispersion and a higher stability of vanadia on the DMSN support when compared to incipient wetness impregnation (denoted V/DMSN).
A surface V density of 0.55 V nm2 (2 wt% V), gave the highest STY of 9.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 5).

Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst.
Overall, extensive research into VOx-based catalysts has been undertaken, with the clear limitation being overoxidation to COx products, but recent developments with one-step preparations and grafting techniques have improved catalyst performance to be comparable with the most active DDH Pt- and CrOx catalysts. Deep oxidation remains a challenge for VOx and other supported metal oxides. However, it is clear than B-based catalysts, although recently developed and less understood in both structure and mechanism, have clear potential for commercialisation due to the high selectivity at high propane conversion. Additionally, ethene is formed as a secondary product. Many B-based catalysts have similar, if not higher, STYs compared to DDH catalysts.
Despite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260 The enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene. While this Cr2O3/AC exhibited the highest STY of propene out of all CrOx-based catalysts (21 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, Table 11, entry 9), it rapidly deactivated on-stream and due to the support being carbonaceous, cannot be regenerated using air. This severely limits the utility of this catalyst.
The majority of investigations on ODH-CO2 Cr2O3 catalysts have focused on support modifications, the addition of a promotor has also been shown to be beneficial. Yun et al. demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to a 10 wt% CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst increased the propane and CO2 conversion, as well as the on-stream stability.264 After 1 h on-stream, the Ni-promoted catalyst was 50% more active and the conversion and selectivity was almost maintained over 12 h on-stream. In contrast, the less active unpromoted catalyst retained only half of the initial activity over the same time period.
The role of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts.
In addition to the acidbase properties of the support, the authors considered the interaction between the Ga and the support to be of importance. In the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, a significant proportion of the Ga (45%) was reduced. This catalyst exhibited the highest propane conversion, but with a propene selectivity of 73% it did not result in the highest propene yield.
Although the addition of Al2O3 to ODH-CO2 catalysts is typically not beneficial,114,273 Chen et al. investigated spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides and showed that they can function as stable catalysts.274,275 At 600 C, although the initial propane conversion was similar for DDH and ODH-CO2, after 8 h on-stream the stability of the catalyst was markedly improved in the presence of CO2, where Ga8Al2O15 retained 66% of its initial activity, compared to just 44% in the absence of CO2. The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst.
The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few.
In many cases, the catalyst can be regenerated periodically, by burning off the coke using O2. As discussed above, catalyst regeneration is commonplace in commercial DDH processes and therefore isn't necessarily a barrier to commercialisation. However, the best STYs reported are, with few exceptions, in the range of 510 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, whereas for the DDH reaction, values over 100 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 are possible. As a result, further advances in the activation of propane over ODH-CO2 catalysts are required.
Despite dozens of reports over several decades on Cr- and Ga- based catalysts, the improvements in catalyst performance have been incremental. The knowledge gained from these studies on the importance of reducibility and the balance of acid and base sites should be applied to supported NP catalysts, which are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalyst.

1.A variety of catalysts have been developed for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques to address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods. Ni-based catalysts, particularly NiO-CeO2, have shown promise in oxidative PDH (ODH-O2) processes. Mo-based catalysts are also being investigated, but they currently have low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may be a strong candidate for an active and selective catalyst. Vanadia- and boron-based catalysts have been extensively researched for ODH-O2, with recent developments improving catalyst performance to be comparable with the most active DDH Pt- and CrOx catalysts. B-based catalysts have clear potential for commercialization due to their high selectivity at high propane conversion and similar or higher space-time yields (STYs) compared to DDH catalysts. In ODH-CO2 processes, Cr2O3/AC catalysts have shown enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, but they rapidly deactivate on-stream and cannot be regenerated using air. The addition of a promoter, such as Ni, has been shown to increase propane and CO2 conversion and on-stream stability. Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibits high activity, while SiO2 and MgO result in poorer performing catalysts. The interaction between Ga and the support is important, with Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts showing high propane conversion but lower propene selectivity. Spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides have been shown to function as stable catalysts in ODH-CO2 processes. The poor on-stream stability of chromium-based catalysts is a significant barrier to commercial application, and further advances in the activation of propane over ODH-CO2 catalysts are required. Supported nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are a promising and somewhat neglected category of ODH-CO2 catalysts that should be further investigated.

The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.
The development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene.
The formation of coke over even the most selective catalysts necessitates multi-reactor cycling to facilitate regeneration.
A promising new class of ODH-O2 catalysts has emerged in recent years which use boron as the active component.
The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2.
Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2.
The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements.
Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority.
With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.
