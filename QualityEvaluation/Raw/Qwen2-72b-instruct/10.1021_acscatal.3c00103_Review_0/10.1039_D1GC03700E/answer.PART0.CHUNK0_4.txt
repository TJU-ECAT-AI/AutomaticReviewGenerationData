[5] "The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (ODH-CO2) has also gained interest due to the environmental advantages of utilising CO2."
[6] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
[7] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[8] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a more environmentally preferred process based on energy consumption compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The development of technologies to produce renewable green propane, coupled with new catalytic processes, will provide a platform to produce green propene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. The formation of coke necessitates multi-reactor cycling for regeneration, and new classes of catalysts using boron as the active component have emerged for oxidative dehydrogenation. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in ODH-CO2 has gained interest due to environmental advantages. Future catalyst design should focus on improving selectivity to propene in DDH and ODH-O2, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2. Recommendations focus on using more abundant chemical elements and prioritizing research on the low temperature activation of CO2. With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate.
