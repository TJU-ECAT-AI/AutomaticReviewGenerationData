[1] "In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst."
[2] "The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions. Under these oxidative conditions, the surface area increased from 8.9 m2 g1 to 78.1 m2 g1, due to the formation of mesopores at the surface. The large increase in surface area when compared to the starting material, was a large factor in obtaining the high activity."
[3] "The activity and selectivity were much higher for PtSn/SAPO-34  a yield of 72.4% as compared to a 1015% yield for most V based catalysts. Introducing oxygen into the feed also reduced the formation of coke, which is a feature of instability in DDH. Water formed via ODH-O2 was found to reduce stability, by increasing sintering of Pt due to a weaker metalsupport interaction."
[4] "The role of the support was closely examined for propane ODH-CO2 by Xu et al.114 It was found that Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibited high activity, while SiO2 and MgO resulted in poorer performing catalysts."
[5] "Despite early reports that activated carbon (AC) was not a suitable support for Cr2O3, subsequent studies have shown that above 550 C, the activity of Cr2O3/AC in the presence of CO2 was higher than in the DDH reaction.260 The enhancement in propane conversion due to the presence of CO2 increased at higher temperatures (i.e., above 600 C), although this was chiefly due to propane dry reforming proceeding, generating CO and H2 rather than propene."
[6] "The stability of the dealuminated catalyst was also improved compared with CrAlbeta, but significant loss in activity was observed over the 4 h reaction. In considering the redox properties of the catalysts in this work, and their previous investigations, the authors also identified a strong correlation between the H2 consumption from H2-TPR studies and the reported propene yield, as shown in Fig. 10."
[7] "The enhanced stability seen in Ni-promoted Cr catalysts was not observed in this work and the activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration. Consequently, aggregation of Cr species was suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism in addition to coke formation and overreduction of Cr."
[8] "The most significant barrier to commercial application is the poor on-stream stability exhibited by all chromium-based catalysts. While incremental improvements in the activity of Cr catalysts have been reported since their initial discovery, significant advances in catalyst stability have been relatively few."
[9] "The stability was improved in the presence of CO2 (compared to DDH); ca. 74% of the original activity was retained after 10 h on-stream, which is relatively good compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts."
[10] "The origin of stability was linked to the low rate of coking associated with the spinel catalyst. Using NH3-TPD analysis, the authors concluded that weak Lewis acid sites were conducive to high activity. These acidbase properties most likely contribute to the enhanced stability as well; it is known that stronger acid sites promote oligomerisation pathways that produce coke."
[11] "The catalysts were relatively stable on-stream over 20 h, retaining 80% of their initial activity. Despite the low selectivity, the FeCeO2 catalysts exhibited a comparable STY to supported In2O3 (Table 13) and some Ga2O3 catalysts (Table 12)."
[12] "The catalyst exhibited a low STY of 6.8 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 15, entry 5). Despite this, the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst shows potential to surpass the more commonly researched Fe-zeolites in terms of stability. Whereas previous examples of Fe-zeolites have displayed significant deactivation over 3 h time-on-stream, this In-based catalyst was observed to lose 6% propene yield over a total of 12 h on stream."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing alternative routes to produce propylene from propane. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. Ni-based catalysts, particularly NiO-CeO2, have shown promise in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH-O2). Mo-based catalysts also feature prominently, but their propene selectivity is limited. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibits high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximize performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst. The use of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in ODH-O2 has shown higher activity and selectivity compared to vanadia-based catalysts, and introducing oxygen into the feed reduces the formation of coke. In ODH-CO2, Ga2O3 supported on TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 exhibits high activity, while Cr2O3/AC shows enhanced activity in the presence of CO2 at higher temperatures. Dealuminated Cr-β-zeolite catalysts have shown improved stability compared to CrAlbeta. Ni-promoted Cr catalysts have shown enhanced stability, but aggregation of Cr species is suggested as an additional deactivation mechanism. Chromium-based catalysts generally exhibit poor on-stream stability, but incremental improvements in activity have been reported. ZnO/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown improved stability in the presence of CO2 compared to Ga- and Cr-based catalysts. Spinel-type Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides have shown low coking rates and enhanced stability due to weak Lewis acid sites. FeCeO2 catalysts have shown relatively good stability on-stream, retaining 80% of their initial activity. In2O3Al2O3 catalysts have shown potential for high stability, losing only 6% propene yield over 12 h on-stream.
