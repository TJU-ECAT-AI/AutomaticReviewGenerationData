[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[3] "As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[4] "In addition to alumina, other supports have been investigated. Earlier reports by Ovsitser et al. described a silica supported VOx catalyst which exhibited high propene yield (86%), high stability and minimal deactivation over a 20 h DDH reaction.144 Hu et al. explored vanadium doped porous silica (VSiO2) with varying V:Si mass ratios of vanadium to silicon of 1:24, 1:12, 1:6, and 1:3, respectively.145 The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[5] "The concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions."
[6] "Zhang and Liu187 also investigated VMgO catalysts with the aim of increasing the loading whilst maintaining a high level of dispersion on SBA-15, which has previously been show V2O5 crystallite formation even at low loading levels. To limit agglomeration of vanadia, co-impregnation of V and Mg was undertaken which resulted in the suppression of 3D V2O5 crystallite formation."
[7] "The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield."
[8] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies and loadings when compared to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."
[9] "The preparation route of Al2O3 was varied to form flower-like, sphere-like and bulk-like morphologies to investigate the influence of varying porosities. Bulk-like morphology only exhibited intraparticle pores, and the monolithic architecture of γ-Al2O3 (formed by a roasting method) achieved the highest productivity for ODH-O2, despite the surface vanadia species being consistent across all architectures, with the degree of polymerisation being fairly similar for all Al2O3 structures as (shown by adsorption edge energy analysis)."
[10] "Mesoporosity was also explored when forming fibrous vanadia catalysts via electrospinning. A comparison between fibrous catalysts which presented mesoporosity, and particle-like catalysts without apparent mesoporosity, indicated no influence on catalytic performance due to porosity,192 consistent with the aforementioned morphology analysis."
[11] "A h-BN/cordierite monolithic catalyst exhibited a productivity increase of 55% when compared to elemental B. This is among the most active B catalysts reported to date. It was shown that optimising conditions for a high WHSV can lower CO2 selectivity to 0%, which impressive even by the standards of h-BN catalysts."
[12] "When comparing macroporous BPO4 to bulk BPO4, it was found that the macroporous structure increased the performance significantly. The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6).211 When using the same WHSV, macroporous BPO4 exhibited three-times the conversion of bulk BPO4 despite being tested at a 30 C lower temperature, whilst achieving roughly the same product distribution."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by developing innovative catalyst design strategies. These strategies include controlling the crystallization temperature of the support to influence the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, modifying catalysts with Mg to reduce coke deposits and improve catalytic performance, applying innovative techniques like direct co-assembly for V/SiO2 catalysts to enhance the interaction between V5+ species and the silica support, and exploring other supports like silica for high propene yield and stability. Additionally, varying the concentration of dopant atoms and the temperature of reduction can affect the catalytic behavior of ZrO2-based catalysts, while co-impregnation of V and Mg can limit agglomeration of vanadia and suppress 3D V2O5 crystallite formation. Acidic supports can increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts, and one-step synthesis methods can improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies, and loadings. Varying the preparation route of Al2O3 to form different morphologies can influence porosities and productivity for ODH-O2, and mesoporosity in fibrous vanadia catalysts does not significantly affect catalytic performance.
