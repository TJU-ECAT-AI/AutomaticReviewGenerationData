[1] "In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst."
[2] "In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application."
[3] "In summary, while the ODH-N2O reaction is hindered significantly by its tendency to deactivate rapidly without the presence of O2, Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst is very resistant to deactivation and its use for the ODH-N2O reaction is contingent on several factors."
[4] "In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported."
[5] "The ODH-O2 catalysts on the other hand are generally much more stable on-stream."
[6] "In summary, although Fe-ZSM-5 has the most potential for the ODH-N2O reaction for propane, several other catalysts have been tested. Vanadia based catalysts have been shown to be highly active for the reaction, which were found to be more selective when supported on less acidic, silica-based support materials, and at loading levels of lower than 5 wt%."
[7] "The ability of Cr to catalyse multiple sub-reactions is likely to be related to its stability (and activity) in multiple valence states."
[8] "Aside from the active element, catalyst supports also comprise a vital component of any propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase."
[9] "A multitude of chemical elements including precious metals, rare earth metals, base metals and non-metals have all been discovered to play a role in catalysing propane dehydrogenation in various contexts."
[10] "In the DDH reaction, the most active elements are typically Pt and Cr, which are already implemented in commercial processes, and more recently Zr and Zn-based alternatives have been used."
[11] "The ODH-O2 reaction has recently been dominated by the discovery of boron-based catalysts, which are highly abundant compared to most other ODH-O2 catalysts such as V."
[12] "ODH-CO2 catalysts are typically Cr or Ga based."
[13] "The field of research into DDH and ODH-O2 is very diverse, and in recent years a number of novel discoveries has expanded the range of catalytically active elements known for this reaction."
[14] "Future sustainable DDH and ODH-O2 processes should capitalise on this knowledge and implement abundant elements such as B, Zn, V or Zr."
[15] "With regards to ODH-CO2, the performance of the most active catalysts is still well below what would be considered for commercialisation, but the research community should look to the successes of the abovementioned abundant elements for inspiration in designing novel ODH-CO2 catalysts."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by offering alternative routes to produce propylene. These techniques include oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DDH). ODH processes, such as ODH-O2 and ODH-CO2, utilize oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants to facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane, which can potentially reduce the formation of coke and improve the selectivity to propylene. DDH processes, on the other hand, involve the direct dehydrogenation of propane without the use of an oxidant. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. For instance, in ODH-O2, boron-based catalysts have shown exceptional performance with high space-time yields, making them promising for commercial application. In ODH-CO2, while the catalysts are not as active as those for ODH-O2, research is ongoing to improve catalyst performance. In DDH, efforts are focused on reducing deep dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coking and improving the selectivity to propylene. Catalysts based on elements like boron, zinc, vanadium, and zirconium are being explored for their abundance and potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of PDH processes.
