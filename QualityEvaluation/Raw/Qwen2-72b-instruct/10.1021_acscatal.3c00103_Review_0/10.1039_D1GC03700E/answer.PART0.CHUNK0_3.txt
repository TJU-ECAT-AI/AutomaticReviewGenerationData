[1] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."
[2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
[3] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
[4] "Future catalyst design in DDH and ODH-O2 should focus on improving selectivity to propene, while ODH-CO2 catalysts are limited by their low intrinsic activity with respect to CO2."
[5] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[6] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
[7] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a more energy-efficient and environmentally preferred process for propene production compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques, particularly direct dehydrogenation (DDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offer a platform for producing green propene from renewable propane sources, which are gaining traction in the industry. However, current ODH-CO2 catalysts are not yet commercially viable due to their low activity levels. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and non-oxidative PDH processes. These strategies include focusing on improving selectivity to propene in DDH and ODH-O2, addressing the low intrinsic activity of ODH-CO2 catalysts towards CO2, utilizing more abundant chemical elements, and prioritizing research on low-temperature activation of CO2. With further advancements, PDH techniques have the potential to transform the manufacturing landscape of propene, a key chemical intermediate.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解更节能、更环保的丙烯生产过程，解决了工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的挑战。特别是直接脱氢（DDH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）技术，为从可再生丙烷来源生产绿色丙烯提供了平台，这在工业中正获得关注。然而，当前的ODH-CO2催化剂由于活性水平低，尚不具备商业可行性。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服PDH过程中氧化和非氧化过程中的失活问题，增强稳定性，提高可回收性。这些策略包括：在DDH和ODH-O2中提高对丙烯的选择性，解决ODH-CO2催化剂对CO2的低固有活性，使用更丰富的化学元素，以及优先研究CO2的低温活化。随着进一步的发展，PDH技术有可能改变丙烯这一关键化学中间体的制造格局。
