[1] "In summary, a variety of different catalysts have been shown to be active and selective for ODH-O2. While vanadia- and boron-based catalysts comprise a large proportion of the reports to date, Ni-based catalysts have shown promise, particularly NiO-CeO2. Mo-Based catalysts also prominently feature but are currently limited in comparison to analogous metal oxide catalysts, with low propene selectivity at moderate propane conversion. Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, although much less active than NiOx per kg, exhibited high selectivity to olefins at moderate propane conversion and may warrant further investigation to maximise performance. High surface area, porous C3N4 may be a strong candidate to produce an active and selective catalyst."
[2] "In ODH-O2, B-based catalysts are the best performing, with STY values in excess of 70 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 reported. Some boron catalysts exceeded 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the 5 kgC3H6 kgcat h1 threshold and underscores their potential for commercial application."
[3] "The advent of boron-based catalysts for this reaction has led to a significant increase in the prospects for commercial application. As a relatively stable, non-hazardous and abundant element, boron catalysts may well play a major role in future propene production processes. Furthermore, they appear to be stable on-stream in laboratory tests, although industrially relevant stability tests have not yet been reported."
[4] "In ODH-CO2, CrOx based catalysts yield the highest STY, but only incremental advances have been made in recent years and it will take a step-change in catalyst development before ODH-CO2 can be meaningfully compared to DDH and ODH-O2 reactions, as a mean to produce propene."
[5] "In ODH-N2O, Fe-ZSM-5 are the most active catalysts known, and in one example a STY of 178 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was reported. ODH-N2O is the least studied sub-reaction and it is thought that the relatively high cost and low availability of N2O may be the most limiting aspect."
[6] "The most promising materials currently are steamed Fe-ZSM-5, as the steam treatment has been found to produce more Fe2+ sites and dealuminate the framework, causing an increase in weak and medium acid sites. With fewer strong protonic sites, the reaction mechanism shifts towards favouring the dehydrogenation of propane, therefore resulting in a consecutive propane dehydrogenation-propene cracking pathway which allows for a higher selectivity to propene with shorter contact times."
[7] "In summary, although Fe-ZSM-5 has the most potential for the ODH-N2O reaction for propane, several other catalysts have been tested. Vanadia based catalysts have been shown to be highly active for the reaction, which were found to be more selective when supported on less acidic, silica-based support materials, and at loading levels of lower than 5 wt%. Indium based catalysts have also been suggested for the ODH-N2O reaction, with the potential for a highly stable catalyst compared to Fe-ZSM-5, which displays significant deactivation and is likely to be the underlying reason behind the relatively low research effort put into the N2O route compared to the other potential oxidants described in this review article."

1.In the context of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address these challenges by providing alternative routes to produce propylene. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. For ODH-O2, B-based catalysts have shown the best performance, with some boron catalysts exceeding 200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, well above the threshold for commercial application. Boron catalysts are relatively stable, non-hazardous, and abundant, making them promising for future propene production. In ODH-CO2, CrOx-based catalysts yield the highest STY, but incremental advances have been made, and a step-change in catalyst development is needed. ODH-N2O is the least studied, with Fe-ZSM-5 being the most active catalyst, but the high cost and low availability of N2O limit its potential. Steamed Fe-ZSM-5 has shown promise, producing more Fe2+ sites and increasing weak and medium acid sites, leading to higher selectivity to propene. Vanadia-based catalysts and indium-based catalysts have also been suggested for ODH-N2O, with the potential for higher stability compared to Fe-ZSM-5.

1.在工业对丙烯需求增加和传统生产方法局限性的背景下，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术通过提供生产丙烯的替代途径来应对这些挑战。正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略，以克服氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的失活问题，提高稳定性，并改善可回收性。对于ODH-O2，基于B的催化剂表现出最佳性能，一些硼催化剂的产量超过200 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1，远高于商业应用的门槛。硼催化剂相对稳定，无害，且丰富，使其成为未来丙烯生产有前景的选择。在ODH-CO2中，CrOx基催化剂的产量最高，但近年来仅取得了增量进展，催化剂开发需要发生质变。ODH-N2O是最少研究的，Fe-ZSM-5是最活跃的催化剂，但N2O的高成本和低可用性限制了其潜力。蒸气处理的Fe-ZSM-5显示出潜力，产生更多的Fe2+位点，增加弱酸和中酸位点，导致对丙烯的更高选择性。基于钒的催化剂和基于铟的催化剂也被建议用于ODH-N2O，与Fe-ZSM-5相比，具有更高的稳定性的潜力。
