[1] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."
[2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
[3] "Despite significant advances in the past decade, current ODH-CO2 catalysts remain far from displaying the activity levels necessary to be considered for commercial application."
[4] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[5] "Future research should focus on the low temperature activation of CO2 as a priority."
[6] "With further research and development of lower energy routes to propene based on the dehydrogenation of green propane, it should be possible to transform the manufacturing landscape of this key chemical intermediate."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques address the challenges of increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods by providing a more environmentally preferred process based on energy consumption compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. These techniques are gaining traction as they can potentially produce green propene from renewable green propane, which is becoming more available due to the development of technologies to produce it. However, current oxidative dehydrogenation of CO2 (ODH-CO2) catalysts are not yet active enough for commercial application. Research is focusing on using more abundant chemical elements for catalysts and prioritizing the low temperature activation of CO2. With further research and development, PDH techniques based on the dehydrogenation of green propane could transform the manufacturing landscape of propylene.
