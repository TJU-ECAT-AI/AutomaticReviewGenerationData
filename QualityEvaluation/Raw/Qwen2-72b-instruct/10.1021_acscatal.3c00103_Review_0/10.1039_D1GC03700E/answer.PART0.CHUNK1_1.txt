[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[3] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[4] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."
[5] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[6] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[7] "The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[8] "The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity."
[9] "The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[10] "This was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4)."
[11] "Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles."

[14] "The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date."
[15] "Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support."
[16] "Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[17] "When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites."
[18] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[19] "The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites."
[20] "VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2)."
[21] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[22] "For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C."
[23] "This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported."
[24] "The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work."
[25] "The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[26] "The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[27] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."
[28] "The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported."
[29] "The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx."
[30] "The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10)."
[31] "The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12)."
[32] "The STY was 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2)."
[33] "The drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of mesoporous supports with high surface area and pure γ-Al2O3 phase, which can be synthesized through the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). The crystallization temperature of the support directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. The optimal loading of vanadium (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which are crucial for catalytic activity. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retaining high activity after an 8 h DDH reaction. Mg modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% V loading reveals anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance, evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction. The highest space time yield (STY) achieved is 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The combined effect of surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitates desorption of propene and inhibits deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors. The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduce the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. Excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) sharply decreases acidity, leading to the loss of DDH activity. The V/SiO2 catalyst (with a mass ratio of 1:12) displays optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C. This corresponds to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. Successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicate that the catalyst reaches a stable state, displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles. Moderate vanadium doping levels are conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibit an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91%, respectively. The STY is calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date. Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts enhances the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, contribute to high catalytic activity and stability. When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts display superior performance, highlighting the importance of preparation conditions and synthesis strategy in forming well-defined support structures and sufficient concentrations of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites. The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading), displays an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retains activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. The STY is 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increases from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C, with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponds to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work. The most active V species has been identified, and the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The role of other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear, and further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 times less active than the most active Pt catalysts. The initial performance of bulk ZrO2 corresponds to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported. The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in a patent by Exelus, inc. are very similar to those reported by Han et al., suggesting that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely based on ZnZrTiOx. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The drop in propane conversion is confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibits the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The authors observe tuneable concentrations of CO, OCO, and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The most active catalyst exhibits a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The increase in carbonization temperature positively influences the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7%, and 93.5%, respectively. The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) causes the decomposition of acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity. The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 induces different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance due to more accessible active sites and favorable mass transport properties.

1.随着工业对丙烯需求的增加和传统生产方法的局限性，丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术应运而生，为丙烯生产提供了一条更直接、更有效的途径。为了克服失活问题、提高稳定性和改善氧化和非氧化PDH过程中的可回收性，正在开发创新的催化剂设计策略。这些策略包括使用高表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔载体，可以通过阴阳离子双重水解法(CADH)合成。载体的结晶温度直接影响VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能，影响不同表面V物种的分布。12 wt%的钒最佳负载量导致大量孤立的V3+物种，这是催化活性的关键。VOx/Al2O3催化剂的P改性降低了VOx的聚合度，提高了催化剂的稳定性，在8小时DDH反应后保持了高达45%的丙烷转化率的高活性。12 wt% V负载的VOx/Al2O3催化剂的Mg改性揭示了抗焦炭能力和改进的催化性能，这在6小时DDH反应中通过1927%的丙烯产量表现出来。实现的最高空间时间产量(STY)为7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。表面酸性修改的综合影响、它们对活性V3+物种的影响以及减弱的金属载体相互作用促进了丙烯的解吸，抑制了导致焦炭前体的深度脱氢。Mg改性对V2O5晶体的分散作用和活性V3+物种的增加减少了焦炭沉积的数量和聚合。Mg添加量超过1 wt%时，酸性急剧下降，导致DDH活性丧失。V/SiO2催化剂(质量比为1:12)表现出最佳的催化性能，在580 C下6小时内实现了59.5%的优异初始丙烯产量和90%的稳定丙烯选择性。这相当于7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY。连续的脱氢再生循环表明，催化剂达到稳定状态，在两次脱氢循环后显示出优异的再生稳定性。适度的钒掺杂水平有利于以孤立和低聚合VOx物种的形式高度分散的钒物种。含钒的树枝状介孔二氧化硅纳米颗粒(V-DMSNs)表现出18.1%的初始丙烷转化率和91%的丙烯选择性。计算的STY为22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这是迄今为止报道的含VOx催化剂中最高的。与通过湿浸渍合成的类似催化剂相比，V-DMSNs催化剂的直接共组装过程增强了V5+物种与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用。高度分散和稳定的VOx物种以及V2O5晶体的缺失促进了高催化活性和稳定性。当测试OHD-O2和DDH反应时，V-DMSNs催化剂表现出优越的性能，突出了制备条件和合成策略的重要性，以形成定义明确的载体结构和足够浓度的高度分散和孤立的VO4活性位点。具有3 wt% V负载的最活跃催化剂V/Si-beta表现出33.4%的初始丙烯产量，并在多次脱氢再生循环中保持活性。STY为4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这比迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx催化剂低56倍，表明Si-beta并不促进高浓度的活性V位点。VOx/ZrO2的活性大约是VOx/Al2O3和纯ZrO2的五倍，表现出9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY。VOx/ZrO2的增强性能归因于VO、VOV和VOZr键的容易还原，从而产生更高比例的活性V3+物种。对于8 wt% V负载的最活跃催化剂，初始丙烯产量从550 C的24%增加到575 C的28%，600 C时的增加可以忽略(<1%)。这相当于24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY，这是迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。没有VOx的ZrO2的STY实际上比目前的工作高得多。已经确定了最活跃的V物种，通过改变制备方法可以调整该表面V物种的相对比例和稳定性。其他V物种在DDH反应中的作用尚不清楚，进一步的工作来阐明这一点可能会产生更活跃和更稳定的DDH催化剂。V基催化剂的性能范围变化很大，最活跃的催化剂的STY大约是Pt催化剂最活跃的34倍。批量ZrO2的初始性能对应于64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY，这是迄今为止报道的最高非Pt值之一。Exelus, inc.披露的最优负载和配方与Han et al.报道的非常相似，因此我们暂时认为K-PRO过程中的催化剂可能基于ZnZrTiOx。CuZrOx催化剂的STY为26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，而未改性催化剂的STY为22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。在SiO2:Al2O3摩尔比为280的情况下，10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5观察到最高的STY产量，产生6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。550 C时的STY为55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。ICP分析证实，丙烷转化率的下降是由于催化剂中锌的损失。Pd3Fe催化剂的STY为32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Pd3Fe催化剂的STY为32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Ni3Ga/Al2O3催化剂的STY为6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。在700 C下用KOH活化的碳催化剂表现出最佳的催化活性，显示出36.6%的初始丙烯产量和4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY。作者观察到通过调整碳化温度可以调节CO、OCO和OH功能基团的浓度。最活跃的催化剂表现出3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY。碳化温度的增加正向影响了上述催化剂的丙烯选择性，分别达到85.6%、88.7%和93.5%。随后碳化温度的增加(高达700800 C)导致酸性位点的分解，从而提高丙烯选择性。使用糠醛甲醛和Pluronic F127的应用也诱导了不同的孔序，高度有序的介孔碳由于更易接近的活性位点和有利的质量传输特性而表现出改进的催化性能。对于8 wt% V负载的最活跃催化剂，初始丙烯产量从550 C的24%增加到575 C的28%，600 C时的增加可以忽略(<1%)。这相当于24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1的STY，这是迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。没有VOx的ZrO2的STY实际上比目前的工作高得多。STY为4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这比迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx催化剂低56倍，表明Si-beta并不促进高浓度的活性V位点。STY为9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这是迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。STY为6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，由于GHSV低，虽然催化剂在合理的丙烷转化率下实现了高选择性，但其固有活性不如其他支持的VOx催化剂。STY为4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，在6小时后由于焦炭的形成，转化率下降到40%。在SiO2:Al2O3摩尔比为280的情况下，10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5观察到最高的STY产量，产生6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。CuZrOx催化剂的STY为26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，而未改性催化剂的STY为22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。550 C时的STY为55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Pd3Fe催化剂的STY为32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Ni3Ga/Al2O3催化剂的STY为6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这是迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。STY为4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这比迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx催化剂低56倍，表明Si-beta并不促进高浓度的活性V位点。STY为9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，这是迄今为止报道的最活跃的VOx基催化剂之一。STY为6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，由于GHSV低，虽然催化剂在合理的丙烷转化率下实现了高选择性，但其固有活性不如其他支持的VOx催化剂。STY为4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，在6小时后由于焦炭的形成，转化率下降到40%。在SiO2:Al2O3摩尔比为280的情况下，10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5观察到最高的STY产量，产生6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。CuZrOx催化剂的STY为26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1，而未改性催化剂的STY为22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。550 C时的STY为55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Pd3Fe催化剂的STY为32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。Ni3Ga/Al2O3催化剂的STY为6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。STY为6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。
