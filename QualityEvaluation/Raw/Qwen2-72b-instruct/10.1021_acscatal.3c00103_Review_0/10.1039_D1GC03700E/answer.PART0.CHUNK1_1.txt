[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure Î³-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[2] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[3] "Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts."
[4] "Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."
[5] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[6] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[7] "The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[8] "The acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity."
[9] "The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[10] "This was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4)."
[11] "Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles."
[12] "The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species."
[13] "Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively."
[14] "The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date."
[15] "Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support."
[16] "Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability."
[17] "When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites."
[18] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[19] "The STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites."
[20] "VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2)."
[21] "The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species."
[22] "For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C."
[23] "This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported."
[24] "The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work."
[25] "The most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method."
[26] "The role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts."
[27] "The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts."
[28] "The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported."
[29] "The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx."
[30] "The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10)."
[31] "The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12)."
[32] "The STY was 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2)."
[33] "The drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst."
[34] "The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1)."
[35] "The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1)."
[36] "The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8)."
[37] "The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7)."
[38] "The authors observed tuneable concentrations of the CO, OCO and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature."
[39] "The most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6)."
[40] "The increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively."
[41] "The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) caused the decomposition of the acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity."
[42] "The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 also induced different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance as a result of more accessible active sites and favourable mass transport properties."
[43] "The most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C."

[49] "The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts."
[50] "The STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking."

1.Increasing industrial demand for propylene and the limitations of traditional production methods have led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) techniques, which address these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene production. Innovative catalyst design strategies are being developed to overcome deactivation issues, enhance stability, and improve recyclability in both oxidative and nonoxidative PDH processes. These strategies include the use of mesoporous supports with high surface area and pure Î³-Al2O3 phase, which can be synthesized through the cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH). The crystallization temperature of the support directly influences the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, affecting the distribution of different surface V species. The optimal loading of vanadium (12 wt%) results in a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which are crucial for catalytic activity. P modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts decreases the degree of VOx polymerization, improving catalyst stability and retaining high activity after an 8 h DDH reaction. Mg modification of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with 12 wt% V loading reveals anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance, evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction. The highest space time yield (STY) achieved is 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The combined effect of surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitates desorption of propene and inhibits deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors. The dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduce the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. Excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) sharply decreases acidity, leading to the loss of DDH activity. The V/SiO2 catalyst (with a mass ratio of 1:12) displays optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C. This corresponds to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. Successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicate that the catalyst reaches a stable state, displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles. Moderate vanadium doping levels are conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibit an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91%, respectively. The STY is calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date. Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts enhances the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, contribute to high catalytic activity and stability. When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts display superior performance, highlighting the importance of preparation conditions and synthesis strategy in forming well-defined support structures and sufficient concentrations of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites. The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading), displays an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retains activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. The STY is 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites. VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increases from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C, with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponds to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. The STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work. The most active V species has been identified, and the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. The role of other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear, and further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 times less active than the most active Pt catalysts. The initial performance of bulk ZrO2 corresponds to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported. The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in a patent by Exelus, inc. are very similar to those reported by Han et al., suggesting that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely based on ZnZrTiOx. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst is 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst. The highest STY yield is observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5, where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio is 280, producing 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY is 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C. The drop in propane conversion is confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts is 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The STY of the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst is 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibits the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The authors observe tuneable concentrations of CO, OCO, and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature. The most active catalyst exhibits a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1. The increase in carbonization temperature positively influences the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7%, and 93.5%, respectively. The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) causes the decomposition of acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity.
