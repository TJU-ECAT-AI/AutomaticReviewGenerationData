1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. This process is crucial for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, as well as for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into valuable products. The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest due to the importance of unsaturated alcohols as intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. The synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni, are leveraged to promote selective hydrogenation reactions. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. These techniques help in understanding the binding energy and adsorption geometry of reactants on bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for improving the catalytic performance.
