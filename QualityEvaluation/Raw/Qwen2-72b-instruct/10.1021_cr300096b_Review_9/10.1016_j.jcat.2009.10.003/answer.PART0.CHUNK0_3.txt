1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. This process is crucial for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors, as well as for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into valuable products. The selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest due to the importance of unsaturated alcohols as intermediates for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. The synergistic effects of using bimetallic catalysts have been explored to promote the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes. Studies have been conducted to understand the origin of selective hydrogenation of molecules with multiple unsaturated functional groups. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. These tools help in understanding the hydrogenation pathways, the binding energy of reactants on catalyst surfaces, and the activation of functional groups, thereby facilitating the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.
