          The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a significant role in various industrial and research applications. It contributes to the production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons, which are renewable, potentially sustainable, and environmentally benign. The derivatives of biomass often contain CO functional groups, and the facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial for converting biomass derivatives into fuels or chemicals. Bimetallic catalysts have unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts, making them useful in reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces. Bimetallic structures have been shown to strongly affect catalytic performance, with examples demonstrating that specific bimetallic surfaces are more active for dehydrogenation and oxygenate reforming than either of the parent metals. In contrast, other bimetallic subsurface structures show novel low temperature hydrogenation pathways that are absent on either of the monometallic surfaces. These findings have been extended to supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts. The enhanced hydrogenation activity in the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalyst suggests the presence of Pt-terminated bimetallic structures, similar to those used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is proposed that Ni atoms diffuse into the region beneath the surface while Pt atoms segregate to the surface during the reduction process, which is in agreement with DFT predictions that the segregation of Pt atoms to the top-most layer is thermodynamically favored both in the presence of atomic hydrogen and in vacuum.

          催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂，对于各种工业和研究应用具有重要意义。它有助于从生物质和生物质衍生的含氧碳氢化合物中生产燃料和化学品，这些原料可再生、潜在可持续且环境友好。生物质衍生物通常含有CO功能基团，而CO键的催化氢化对于将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品至关重要。双金属催化剂具有与相应的单金属催化剂明显不同的独特性质，使其在氢化、脱氢和重整等反应中具有应用价值。已经进行了许多实验和理论研究，以确定在定义明确的单晶表面上双金属系统的活性和稳定性。双金属结构已被证明对催化性能有显著影响，例如，特定的双金属表面在脱氢和氧化物重整方面比任一母金属更活跃。相比之下，其他双金属亚表面结构显示出在Pt(1 1 1)或Ni(1 1 1)上不存在的新型低温氢化途径。这些发现已扩展到支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中Pt终止的双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于任一单金属催化剂。在Pt/Ni双金属催化剂中观察到增强的氢化活性表明存在Pt终止的双金属结构，类似于在密度泛函理论(DFT)计算中使用的结构。有人提出，Ni原子在还原过程中扩散到表面以下区域，而Pt原子则分层到表面，这与DFT预测一致，即Ni/Pt表面的Pt原子分层到最顶层在原子氢存在和真空条件下都是热力学有利的。
