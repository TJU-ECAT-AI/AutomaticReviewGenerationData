The pivotal role of bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-Ni systems, in the selective hydrogenation of C═O bonds is underscored by their unique properties that distinguish them from monometallic counterparts \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.11.023\]. These catalysts significantly enhance hydrogenation activities, offering superior performance in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride, a critical intermediate for various industries \[10.1016/j.cej.2011.09.023\]. The addition of a small amount of Pt to Ni/Al2O3 boosts activity and selectivity, with the process controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel \[10.1016/j.cej.2011.09.023\]. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, using Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, is significant in fine chemical synthesis, exemplified by the 100% conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid at 40°C \[10.1007/s10562-010-0533-7\]. Zeolites are excellent supports for succinic anhydride production from maleic anhydride hydrogenation, relevant to cellulosic biomass conversion \[10.1007/s10562-010-0533-7\]. Optimization strategies include catalyst preparation, investigation of support and reaction condition effects, and catalyst characterization using X-ray diffraction and temperature-programmed reduction \[10.1007/s10562-010-0533-7\].

Bimetallic catalysts, like NiPt systems, are pivotal in industrial and research applications due to their unique properties, enhancing the selective hydrogenation of C═O bonds \[10.1039/c1cy00066g\]. This process is critical for organic synthesis, specifically in the hydrogenation of propanal to 1-propanol, and serves as an initial step in cellulosic biomass conversion \[10.1039/c1cy00066g\]. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including FTIR and GC, optimize catalysts for improved activity \[10.1039/c1cy00066g\]. NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts outperform monometallic counterparts, suggesting a structure akin to theoretical Pt-terminated configurations \[10.1039/c1cy00066g\]. This work bridges model surfaces and supported catalysts, advancing the design of efficient hydrogenation catalysts \[10.1039/c1cy00066g\].

Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, is pivotal for organic synthesis, notably in the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes for fine chemical production \[10.1002/cctc.201000268\]. This process is also a critical initial step in cellulose biomass conversion, advancing sustainable energy and materials development \[10.1002/cctc.201000268\]. Optimization strategies include DFT calculations, UHV studies, and reactor evaluations, demonstrating the predictability of enhanced CO hydrogenation activity in bimetallic catalysts \[10.1021/cr300096b_9\].
