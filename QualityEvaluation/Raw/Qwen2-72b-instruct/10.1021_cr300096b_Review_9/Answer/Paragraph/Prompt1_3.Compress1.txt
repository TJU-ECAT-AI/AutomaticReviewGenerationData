{"Quotes": "", "English": "Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni, is pivotal in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process, especially the selective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols, is vital for pharmaceutical precursors. Bimetallic catalysts' synergistic effects enhance selectivity. Methodologies including TPD, HREELS, and DFT modeling elucidate reactant binding energy and adsorption geometry on bimetallic surfaces, optimizing catalytic performance. Understanding hydrogenation pathways and functional group activation facilitates the development of more efficient catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2009.10.003"}
