[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"
[2] "In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation."
[3] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."
[4] "Using similar approaches, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations were performed for CO bond hydrogenation of acetaldehyde (246) and acetone (246, 247) over supported Pt3d bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."
[6] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein has been extensively investigated over many Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."
[7] "The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride can produce many different products, but only some of the products are valuable in industry. Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[8] "The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility, increased activity by 10 times, lowered the apparent activation energy, and maintained the selectivity to acetaldehyde at >70%."
[9] "Amines are important compounds for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs. A simple method to form amines is by the reduction of amides, but amides are considered difficult to reduce. Burch et al. found that PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts, synthesized by impregnation, were able to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine."

1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, is crucial for organic synthesis in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. It is also significant in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. The process is studied through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of binding energies, Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluations. These methodologies help in optimizing and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process. The hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts is used as an example to demonstrate the correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental results, showing the feasibility of predicting bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity. This approach has also been applied to the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone. The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been extensively investigated on various Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. PtNi bimetallic catalysts have shown higher hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride. The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid, where the addition of Pt increased activity and maintained selectivity. PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts have been found to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine.
