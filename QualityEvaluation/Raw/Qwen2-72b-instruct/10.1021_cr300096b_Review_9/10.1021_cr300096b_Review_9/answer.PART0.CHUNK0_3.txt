[1] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319)"
[2] "In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation."
[3] "The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity."
[4] "Using similar approaches, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations were performed for CO bond hydrogenation of acetaldehyde (246) and acetone (246, 247) over supported Pt3d bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."
[6] "The selective hydrogenation of acrolein has been extensively investigated over many Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."
[7] "The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride can produce many different products, but only some of the products are valuable in industry. Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[8] "The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility, increased activity by 10 times, lowered the apparent activation energy, and maintained the selectivity to acetaldehyde at >70%."
[9] "Amines are important compounds for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs. A simple method to form amines is by the reduction of amides, but amides are considered difficult to reduce. Burch et al. found that PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts, synthesized by impregnation, were able to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine."

1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. It is essential for organic synthesis, especially in the selective hydrogenation of the C═O bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. Moreover, CO bond hydrogenation is considered an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation. These methods have demonstrated the feasibility of predicting bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity. The hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been extensively investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and many Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts have shown higher hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride. The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid, where adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility, activity, and maintained selectivity to acetaldehyde. PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts have been found to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine, which is important for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs.

1.特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂的C═O键催化氢化，在各种工业和研究应用中起着至关重要的作用。它对于有机合成至关重要，尤其是在α,β-不饱和醛的C═O键选择性氢化中，这在精细化学品和药物前体的生产中越来越受到关注。此外，CO键氢化被认为是纤维素生物质催化转化的重要初始步骤。在理论和实验领域中，研究、优化和增强该过程的选择性和效率的方法包括DFT结合能计算、UHV低温氢化研究以及批式和流动反应器评估。这些方法已经证明了预测具有增强CO氢化活性的双金属催化剂的可行性。对最小的α,β-不饱和醛——丙烯醛的选择性氢化已经在几个3d/Pt(111)表面上进行了广泛研究，并在许多基于Pt的双金属催化剂上进行了研究。在马来酸酐的氢化中，支持的PtNi双金属催化剂显示出比单金属催化剂更高的氢化活性。PtFe/SiO2催化剂已被用于乙酸的部分氢化，其中向Fe/SiO2催化剂添加少量Pt增加了Fe的还原性、活性，并保持了对乙醛的选择性。PtRe/TiO2支持的催化剂已被发现可以有选择性地氢化N-甲基吡咯烷-2-酮中的C═O键，形成N-甲基吡咯烷，这是一种用于制造染料、溶剂、洗涤剂和药物的重要胺。
