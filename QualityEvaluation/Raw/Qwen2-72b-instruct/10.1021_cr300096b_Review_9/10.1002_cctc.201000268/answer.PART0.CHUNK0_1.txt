[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis.13 For instance, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals.4 More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass.5"

1.The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups, particularly using bimetallic catalysts, is a widely applicable reaction route for organic synthesis. It is particularly useful for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to produce fine chemicals. Recently, this process has been recognized as a crucial initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass.
