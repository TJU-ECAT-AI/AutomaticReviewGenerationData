Promoting Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of CO Bonds of Acetone and Acetaldehyde by using CoPt Bimetallic Catalysts Graphical Abstract Dividing the flow: The CoPt bimetallic catalyst (see figure) exhibits higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts from batch and flow reactor studies. DFT calculations reveal that the binding energies of the carbonyl compounds correlate well with the hydrogenation activity.
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis.13 For instance, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals.4 More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass.5 Owing to the toxicity of many α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and the complex structures of cellulose, in the current study, we use acetone and acetaldehyde as probe molecules to identify novel bimetallic catalysts for the low temperature (between 308 and 343K) hydrogenation of carbonyl groups. In addition to being a useful probe reaction, acetone hydrogenation is also an important reaction that can be used to produce 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone.6,7 Furthermore, the facile hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone is of interest for use in the ethanol-acetaldehyde- hydrogen and isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat-pump systems.8 Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity.9,10 Many investigations have been performed to correlate the electronic and catalytic properties by combining fundamental surface-science studies and theoretical calculations.1012 For example, it has been demonstrated that a Pt-terminated Pt-Co-Pt(111) surface, which represents a subsurface bimetallic structure with Pt on the topmost surface layer and Co residing in the subsurface region, shows a much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than a Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt (111) surface and corresponding monometallic surfaces.13,14 The low temperature hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface of these bimetallic structures has been correlated to the presence of weakly bonded adsorbates, owing to the modification of the electronic properties of Pt by the subsurface Co atoms.13,14 More recently, these surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3-supported bimetallic CoPt catalysts, which exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, benzene, and butadiene at low temperatures.1517 The main objective of the present work is to extend the CC hydrogenation activity of γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low temperature hydrogenation of the carbonyl group by using batch and flow reactors. Similar to the correlation established previously for the hydrogenation of CC bonds, the facile CO bond hydrogenation on CoPt can also be correlated to the weaker binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the bimetallic surface, as determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The hydrogenation activity of acetone over the CoPt bimetallic and Co and Pt monometallic catalysts in batch reactor studies is compared in Figure1. The sum of gas-phase concentration of acetone and 2-propanol was constant throughout the reaction (t=3h). This gas-phase mass balance indicates that 2-propanol was the only hydrogenation product. The concentration profiles in Figure1 clearly demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity over the CoPt bimetallic catalyst was much higher than that over Co and Pt monometallic catalysts. To make a more quantitative comparison, the rate of CO hydrogenation was quantified by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of acetone. To avoid the influence of the reverse dehydrogenation reaction at higher 2-propanol concentrations, the fitting was performed for the concentration profile of acetone at a conversion of about 50%. The rate constant was also normalized to the CO uptake of each catalyst obtained from the CO chemisorption measurements, as listed in Table1.

For comparison, the batch reactor results of acetaldehyde hydrogenation are shown in Figure2. Ethanol was the only gas-phase hydrogenation product. The inset in Figure2 clearly shows the production of ethanol over the CoPt bimetallic catalyst, whereas only a trace amount of ethanol was produced over the monometallic Co and Pt catalysts. To obtain comparable reaction rates, the reaction temperature was raised from 308K for acetone to 343K for acetaldehyde. The feed ratio of hydrogen to carbonyl compound was also increased from 2:1 to 4:1 for the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively. As summarized in Table1, for the hydrogenation of both acetaldehyde and acetone the rate constants show the similar trend of CoPt>Pt>Co. The comparison in Table1 also reveals that the hydrogenation rate is slower for acetaldehyde than acetone over the same catalyst.

The conversion of acetone and acetaldehyde obtained from flow reactor studies is presented in Figure3a,b. Similar to the batch reactor results, the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography for the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde is 2-propanol and ethanol, respectively. To obtain a comparable conversion for the two molecules, the amount of catalyst was increased from 20mg for acetone to 40mg for acetaldehyde, with the feed ratio of hydrogen to the carbonyl compound being increased from 4.5:1 for acetone to 10:1 for acetaldehyde. As shown in Figure3, the CoPt bimetallic catalyst demonstrates a higher activity than Pt, in agreement with the trend in the batch reactor studies (Figures1 and 2), as well as with that observed previously for the CC bond hydrogenation.15 Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow reactor study of a)acetone hydrogenation at 308K (reaction conditions: H2/acetone=4.5:1, catalyst 20mg); b)acetaldehyde hydrogenation at 308K (reaction conditions: H2/acetaldehyde=10:1, catalyst 40mg).
Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces.10 One useful parameter to predict changes in the adsorption properties of many adsorbates is the surface d-band center, which was calculated as the first order moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms with respect to the Fermi level. Many experimental and DFT studies have indicated a direct correlation between the value of the surface d-band center and the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes,10,13 with weaker binding energies promoting the low temperature hydrogenation of the CC and CO bonds.18 DFT calculations were performed for the current study to determine whether such a correlation can be extended to acetone and acetaldehyde. The binding energy correlated well to the d-band center (Figure4), with binding energies being the weakest on the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface structure. In comparison, the Co-Pt-Pt(111) surface structure shifted the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, leading to a stronger binding energy, as compared to that on Pt(111) or Co(0001). The binding energy trend taken from Figure4 predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001).

The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation. That the Pt-terminated Pt-Co-Pt subsurface structure is preferred over Co-terminated Co-Pt-Pt in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen is consistent with previous DFT calculations19 and experimental verification.20 The weaker binding energy of the carbonyl compounds on Pt-Co-Pt should lead to higher hydrogenation activity, consistent with the flow and batch reactor studies, with γ-Al2O3 supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts showing higher hydrogenation rate than the monometallic Co and Pt catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations (Figure4) revealed that the binding energy of acetone is weaker than that of acetaldehyde on the four surfaces, which can be explained by the different molecular structure of the two carbonyl compounds. The carbon atom of the carbonyl group in acetaldehyde is attached to a hydrogen atom, whereas this carbon atom in acetone is attached to two methyl groups. The steric hindrance of the two methyl groups in acetone makes it adsorb more weakly than acetaldehyde. Using the same binding energy argument, one would predict that the weaker binding energy of acetone should lead to a higher hydrogenation activity than acetaldehyde over the same CoPt and Pt catalysts, as confirmed in both batch and flow reactor studies.
In conclusion, acetone and acetaldehyde have been used as probe molecules to investigate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and that acetaldehyde reacts more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst. The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001). More importantly, the correlation between the binding energies of the carbonyl compounds and the hydrogenation activity provides the possibility to predict other desirable bimetallic structures and formulations for the CO bond hydrogenation. Further comparison at reaction conditions more relevant to industrial hydrogenation processes would be needed to further validate the unique hydrogenation activity of the CoPt catalysts.
Experimental Section The catalyst preparation, CO chemisorption measurements and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of the CoPt bimetallic catalysts have been reported in detail previously.21 The γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts were prepared by a slurry-based impregnation method, using Co(NO3)26H2O and [Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2] as precursor salts. The pulse CO chemisorption measurements were performed by using an Altamira Instruments AMI-200ip to determine the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the gas-phase concentrations of individual reactants and products during the hydrogenation reactions within a batch reactor, as described elsewhere.15 For acetone hydrogenation, hydrogen gas, and acetone vapor were mixed at a partial pressure ratio of 2:1, whereas for acetaldehyde hydrogenation, the ratio of hydrogen to acetaldehyde was 4:1. The hydrogenation was performed at 308 and 343K for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively. The concentrations of acetone and 2-propanol were estimated by using the peak areas of the characteristic ν(CO) mode at 1738cm1 and the ν(OH) mode at 3656cm1, respectively, whereas that of acetaldehyde and ethanol were using ν(CO) at 1759cm1 (CO) and ν(OH) at 3675cm1. The concentration was calibrated by measuring the vibrational intensity of each compound at a number of gas-phase pressures in a range relevant to the reaction.
Flow reactor studies of acetone hydrogenation were carried out in a quartz glass reactor under atmospheric pressure at 308K. Prior to reaction, the catalyst (0.020g) was reduced under H2 (20mLmin1) and He (20mLmin1) mixture at 723K for 1h. The ramping rate was 14Kmin1. During the reaction, a constant flow of acetone was established by bubbling He through a saturator containing liquid acetone at room temperature of 291.5K. The flow rates of He and H2 were regulated by mass flow controllers, with the total flow rate of 40mLmin1. Based on the saturated vapor pressure of acetone, the ratio of H2 to acetone was calculated to be 4.5:1. The hydrogenation of acetaldehyde was also carried out in the same flow reactor at 308K. For each experiment, 0.040g of catalyst was loaded into the flow reactor. The composition of the gas-phase reactant was a mixture of 2.5% acetaldehyde and 25.0% H2 balanced with He and N2. The total flow rate was 40mLmin1. The products were analyzed by using an online gas chromatography (HP 5890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
DFT calculations were performed by using periodic density functional theory, as implemented in the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP) code. A periodic 3×3 unit cell structure with four layers of metal atoms was used as the slab, separated by six equivalent layers of vacuum. For the four layers of metal, the bottom two layers were frozen with the Pt metal distance of 2.83Å, whereas the top two layers were allowed to relax. Acetone and acetaldehyde were placed onto the surface in the perpendicular (η1μ1) adsorption mode, which was reported elsewhere to be the most stable configuration.22,23
