[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis.13 For instance, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals.4 More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass.5"
