1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does mention that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C. The study also shows that the HYAl2O3 supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibit the best performance among all as-prepared bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, which is mainly due to the PtNi bimetallic formation. For all the supports, PtNi bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于如何使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C=O键的氢化,对精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等各种工业和研究应用的具体信息。但是,它确实提到PtNi是将马来酸转化为琥珀酸的有效催化剂,在40 C时转化率为100%。研究还表明,在所有制备的双金属和单金属催化剂中,HYAl2O3支持的PtNi双金属催化剂表现出最佳性能,这主要是由于PtNi双金属的形成。对于所有载体,PtNi双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于相应的单金属催化剂。
