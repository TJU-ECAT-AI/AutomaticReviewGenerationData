1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does mention that PtNi is an efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C, which could be relevant to fine chemical synthesis. The study of hydrogenation of maleic anhydride over Ni-loaded zeolites catalysts indicates that zeolites are excellent supports for succinic anhydride production from maleic anhydride hydrogenation, which could be related to cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include the preparation of various supported Ni and NiPt catalysts, the investigation of the effects of the support and reaction conditions on catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability, and the characterization of catalysts using X-ray diffraction and temperature-programmed reduction.

1.文献没有提供具体信息，说明使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C=O键的氢化如何对精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等各种工业和研究应用做出贡献。但是，它确实提到PtNi是将马来酸转化为琥珀酸的有效催化剂，在40 C下转化率为100%，这可能与精细化学品合成有关。对负载在沸石催化剂上的Ni进行的马来酸酐氢化研究显示，沸石是马来酸酐氢化生产琥珀酸酐的优良载体，这可能与纤维素生物质转化有关。用于研究、优化和提高该过程选择性和效率的方法包括制备各种支撑的Ni和NiPt催化剂，研究支撑和反应条件对催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的影响，以及使用X射线衍射和温度程序还原对催化剂进行表征。
