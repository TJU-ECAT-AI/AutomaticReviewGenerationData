1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, making them suitable for organic synthesis. This process is crucial for the production of fine chemicals, such as 1-propanol from propanal. Moreover, the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which can be a product of acrolein hydrogenation, is an area of interest. Recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been recognized as a key step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. The study employs theoretical and experimental methodologies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science experiments, to explore the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts for CO bond hydrogenation. Batch and flow reactor studies are conducted to evaluate the catalytic performance and to verify the predictions from theoretical and surface science studies.
