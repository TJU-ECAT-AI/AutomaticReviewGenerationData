1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, making them suitable for specific reactions. The hydrogenation of propanal, a C═O bond-containing compound, is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis, and transition metal-based catalysts, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and NiMo, have been reported for its hydrogenation to produce 1-propanol. The hydrogenation of propanal, which can be a product of the hydrogenation of acrolein, provides insights into the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Moreover, CO bond hydrogenation is considered a crucial initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. The current study aims to explore the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts for CO bond hydrogenation and to verify theoretical predictions and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. Batch reactor studies using FTIR and flow reactor studies using GC are employed to evaluate the catalytic performance and understand the reaction kinetics.
