1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their monometallic counterparts, making them suitable for specific reactions. The hydrogenation of propanal, a C═O bond, is crucial for organic synthesis, and transition metal-based catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and NiMo have been used for this purpose. Propanal hydrogenation studies can also provide insights into the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which are important intermediates in chemical synthesis. Moreover, CO bond hydrogenation is now recognized as a key step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass, a process that is gaining attention for its potential in sustainable energy and chemical production. The research employs a variety of methodologies to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process. These include density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict catalyst activity, surface science experiments to verify theoretical predictions, and catalytic evaluation using batch and flow reactors to assess the performance of supported catalysts under realistic conditions.
