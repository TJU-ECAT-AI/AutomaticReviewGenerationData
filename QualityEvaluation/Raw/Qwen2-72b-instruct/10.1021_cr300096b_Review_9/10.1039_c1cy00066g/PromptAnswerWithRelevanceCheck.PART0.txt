[3] "Catalysts based on transition metals, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and NiMo, have been reported for the hydrogenation of propanal to produce 1-propanol."
[4] "Additionally, studies of the hydrogenation of propanal, which is a possible product of the hydrogenation of acrolein, may provide information on the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
[5] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."
[6] "Therefore, understanding the relationship between the catalyst formulation and catalytic property for propanalhydrogenation should also provide useful information on the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic conversion of cellulose."
[7] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."
[8] "Here we select propanal as the probe molecule to answer these questions using three parallel approaches: (1) DFT calculations of the binding energy of propanal; (2) fundamental surface science studies using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of propanalhydrogenation on model surfaces; (3) synthesis and catalytic evaluation of γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts."
[9] "For gas phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch reactor studies using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to quantify the rate constants for hydrogenation, while flow reactor studies using gas chromatography (GC) are performed to obtain the steady-state conversion and activation barriers."
