1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, making them suitable for specific reactions. The hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial for organic synthesis, and transition metal-based catalysts, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and NiMo, have been used for the hydrogenation of propanal to produce 1-propanol. Propanal, a possible product of acrolein hydrogenation, can provide insights into the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Moreover, CO bond hydrogenation is considered an important step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Understanding the relationship between catalyst formulation and catalytic properties for propanal hydrogenation can aid in the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic conversion of cellulose. The current study aims to explore the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts for CO bond hydrogenation and to verify predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. Propanal is used as a probe molecule, and the study employs DFT calculations, surface science studies using TPD, and the synthesis and evaluation of γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts. Batch and flow reactor studies are conducted to quantify the rate constants for hydrogenation and to obtain steady-state conversion and activation barriers.

1.利用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化,对各种工业和研究应用,特别是精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化,具有重大贡献。双金属催化剂表现出与母体金属明显不同的电子和化学性质,使其适用于特定反应。CO键的催化氢化对于有机合成至关重要,基于过渡金属如Pt、Pd、Rh和NiMo的催化剂已被用于将丙醛氢化为1-丙醇。丙醛是丙烯醛氢化可能的产物,可以为α,β-不饱和醛中CO键的选择性氢化提供见解。此外,CO键氢化被认为是纤维素生物质催化转化的重要步骤。了解催化剂配方与催化丙醛氢化性能之间的关系,可以为选择用于不饱和醛氢化和纤维素催化转化的催化剂提供有用的信息。目前的研究旨在探索NiPt双金属催化剂在CO键氢化中的增强活性,并验证DFT计算和表面科学实验在支撑催化剂中的预测。选择丙醛作为探针分子,并采用DFT计算、使用TPD的表面科学研究以及γ-Al2O3支撑催化剂的合成和评估三种并行方法。对于丙醛的气相氢化,使用FTIR的间歇反应器研究用于量化氢化的速率常数,而使用GC的流动反应器研究用于获得稳态转化率和活化势垒。
