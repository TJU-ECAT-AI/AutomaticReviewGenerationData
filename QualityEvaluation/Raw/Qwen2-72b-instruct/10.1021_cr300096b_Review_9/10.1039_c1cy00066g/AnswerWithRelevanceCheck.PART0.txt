          [1] "Bimetallic catalysts often show electronic and chemical properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals."
          [2] "Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."
          [3] "Catalysts based on transition metals, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, and NiMo, have been reported for the hydrogenation of propanal to produce 1-propanol."
          [4] "Additionally, studies of the hydrogenation of propanal, which is a possible product of the hydrogenation of acrolein, may provide information on the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
          [5] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."
          [6] "Therefore, understanding the relationship between the catalyst formulation and catalytic property for propanal hydrogenation should also provide useful information on the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic conversion of cellulose."
          [7] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."
          [8] "For gas phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch reactor studies using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to quantify the rate constants for hydrogenation, while flow reactor studies using gas chromatography (GC) are performed to obtain the steady-state conversion and activation barriers."
          [9] "The results show that NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibit significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
          [10] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity observed over the NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure may be similar to the Pt-terminated configurations identified in theoretical calculations and surface science."
          [11] "The current work demonstrates a direct link between model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing a promising and efficient way to design efficient hydrogenation bimetallic catalysts."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. Bimetallic catalysts exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, making them suitable for organic synthesis and the hydrogenation of propanal to produce 1-propanol. This process is crucial for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which are potential products of acrolein hydrogenation. Moreover, CO bond hydrogenation is an important initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Understanding the relationship between catalyst formulation and catalytic properties for propanal hydrogenation provides valuable insights into the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic conversion of cellulose. The objectives of the study include exploring the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts for CO bond hydrogenation and verifying predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. Methodologies employed include batch reactor studies using FTIR to quantify rate constants for hydrogenation and flow reactor studies using GC to obtain steady-state conversion and activation barriers. The results demonstrate that NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibit significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts, suggesting that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure may resemble the Pt-terminated configurations identified in theoretical calculations and surface science. This work establishes a direct link between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a promising and efficient approach to design efficient hydrogenation bimetallic catalysts.

          利用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C═O键的氢化反应，对各种工业和研究应用，特别是精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化，具有重大贡献。双金属催化剂表现出与母体金属明显不同的电子和化学性质，使其适用于有机合成和将丙醛氢化为1-丙醇。这一过程对于α,β-不饱和醛中CO键的有选择性氢化至关重要，而α,β-不饱和醛是丙烯醛氢化的潜在产物。此外，CO键的氢化是纤维素生物质催化转化的重要初始步骤。了解催化剂配方与催化性质之间的关系对于丙醛氢化，为选择用于不饱和醛氢化和纤维素催化转化的催化剂提供了宝贵的见解。研究目标包括探索NiPt双金属催化剂在CO键氢化中的增强活性，以及在支撑催化剂中验证DFT计算和表面科学实验的预测。采用的方法包括使用FTIR的间歇反应器研究，以量化氢化的速率常数，以及使用GC的流动反应器研究，以获得稳态转化率和活化能。结果表明，NiPt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的CO氢化活性明显高于单金属催化剂，表明支撑的双金属纳米粒子结构可能类似于理论计算和表面科学中识别的Pt-终止配置。这项工作在模型表面和支撑催化剂之间建立了直接联系，为设计高效的双金属氢化催化剂提供了一种有希望且有效的方法。
