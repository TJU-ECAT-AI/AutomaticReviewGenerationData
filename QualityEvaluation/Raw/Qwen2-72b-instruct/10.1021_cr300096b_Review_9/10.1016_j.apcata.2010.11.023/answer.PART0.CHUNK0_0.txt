1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. It contributes to the production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons, which are renewable, potentially sustainable, and environmentally friendly. The derivatives of biomass often contain CO functional groups, and the facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is essential for converting biomass derivatives into fuels or chemicals. Bimetallic catalysts, due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts, have been widely used in reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to investigate the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces, demonstrating that bimetallic structures significantly influence their catalytic performance. Surface science results have been applied to γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts.

1.催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂，对于各种工业和研究应用至关重要。它促进了从生物质和生物质衍生的含氧碳氢化合物生产燃料和化学品，这些产品可再生、潜在可持续且环保。生物质衍生物通常含有CO功能基团，而CO键的催化氢化对于将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品至关重要。由于双金属催化剂具有与单金属催化剂明显不同的独特性质，它们已被广泛用于氢化、脱氢和重整等反应中。进行了大量实验和理论研究，以确定在明确定义的单晶表面上双金属系统的活性和稳定性，证明双金属结构对其催化性能有重大影响。表面科学的结果已应用于γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中Pt终止的双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于任一单金属催化剂。
