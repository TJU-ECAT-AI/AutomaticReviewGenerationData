1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, is crucial for the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals. This process is important in various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion due to the renewable, potentially sustainable, and environmentally benign nature of biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons. Bimetallic catalysts are utilized in many reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming due to their unique properties that differ from those of monometallic catalysts. Bimetallic structures have a significant impact on catalytic performance, and Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts have been shown to have higher hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts.

1.利用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂对C═O键进行催化氢化,对于将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品至关重要。这一过程在诸如精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等工业和研究应用中非常重要,因为生物质和生物质衍生的含氧烃具有可再生、潜在可持续和环境友好的特性。双金属催化剂因其独特的性质而被用于许多反应,如氢化、脱氢和重整,这些性质与单金属催化剂明显不同。双金属结构对催化性能有重大影响,而Pt终止的双金属催化剂已被证明比单金属催化剂具有更高的氢化活性。
