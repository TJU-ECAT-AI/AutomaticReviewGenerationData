1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a significant role in various industrial and research applications. It is crucial for the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals, especially in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts are widely used in reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces. These studies have shown that bimetallic structures have a strong impact on catalytic performance. For instance, Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 supports exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts.

1.使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C═O键的氢化，在各种工业和研究应用中起着重要作用，特别是在将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品，尤其是催化转化纤维素生物质方面。双金属催化剂因其独特的性质而在氢化、脱氢和重整等反应中得到广泛应用，这些性质与单金属催化剂明显不同。为了确定双金属系统在明确定义的单晶表面上的活性和稳定性，进行了大量的实验和理论研究。这些研究表明，双金属结构对催化性能有重大影响。例如，γ-Al2O3支持的Pt-终止双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于其单金属催化剂。
