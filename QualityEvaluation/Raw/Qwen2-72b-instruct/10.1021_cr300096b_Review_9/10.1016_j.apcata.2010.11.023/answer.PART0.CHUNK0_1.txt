1.The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels and chemicals. This process is significant due to the renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly nature of biomass. The CO functional groups in biomass derivatives necessitate efficient catalytic hydrogenation for their conversion. Bimetallic catalysts, with their distinct properties compared to monometallic catalysts, have been widely used in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming reactions. The structure of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their catalytic performance. Pt-terminated Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 have shown higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts.
2.Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process across theoretical and experimental domains include density functional theory (DFT) calculations, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. DFT calculations help predict the binding energies of reactants on various surfaces, while EXAFS measurements confirm the presence of bimetallic bonds and their extent. FTIR spectroscopy is used to monitor the gas-phase concentrations of reactants and products during hydrogenation reactions. These techniques provide insights into the origins of differences in hydrogenation activity and help in the systematic understanding of the interaction of bimetallic particles on different oxide supports.

1.使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂对C═O键进行催化氢化,在将生物质衍生物转化为燃料和化学品的过程中起着至关重要的作用。由于生物质的可再生、潜在的可持续性和环境友好性,这一过程具有重要意义。生物质衍生物中的CO官能团需要有效的催化氢化才能进行转化。与单金属催化剂相比,双金属催化剂具有独特的性质,已被广泛用于氢化、脱氢和重整反应中。双金属催化剂的结构对其催化性能有重大影响。在γ-Al2O3上支持的Pt终止的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂显示出比单金属催化剂更高的氢化活性。
2.在理论和实验领域中,用于研究、优化和增强氢化过程选择性和效率的方法包括密度泛函理论(DFT)计算、扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)测量和傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱。DFT计算有助于预测各种表面上反应物的结合能,而EXAFS测量则证实了双金属键的存在及其程度。FTIR光谱用于监测氢化反应中反应物和产物的气相浓度。这些技术为氢化活性差异的起源提供了见解,并有助于系统地理解双金属粒子在不同氧化物载体上的相互作用。
