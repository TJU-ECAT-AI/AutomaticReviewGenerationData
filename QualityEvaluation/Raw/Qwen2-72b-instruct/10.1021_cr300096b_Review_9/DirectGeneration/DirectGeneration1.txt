Selective C‚ïêO bond hydrogenation, a pivotal process in both industrial and research contexts, involves the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols or other functional groups, facilitated by bimetallic catalysts. This transformation is crucial for the synthesis of a wide array of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Bimetallic catalysts, composed of two different metals, offer enhanced selectivity and activity compared to monometallic counterparts, making them particularly valuable in complex reaction mixtures. The interplay between theoretical calculations and experimental studies is essential for optimizing these catalysts. Theoretical calculations, often employing density functional theory (DFT), provide insights into the electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts, guiding the design of more efficient bimetallic systems. Experimental studies, on the other hand, validate these predictions and fine-tune the catalysts through systematic variation of synthesis parameters and reaction conditions. This synergy between theory and experiment accelerates the development of bimetallic catalysts with improved performance, leading to more sustainable and cost-effective chemical processes.
