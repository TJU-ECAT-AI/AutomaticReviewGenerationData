Chemical Engineering Journal 98 (2004) 99104 PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts: effect of catalyst preparation and chemisorption methods on H2 and O2 uptake Pakornphant Chantaravitoon a, Sumaeth Chavadej a,, Johannes Schwank b a The Petroleum and Petrochemical College, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand b Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2136, USA Received 6 June 2003; accepted 22 July 2003 Abstract Pulse and static hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption techniques for determining the platinum dispersion in bimetallic PtSn catalysts were carried out and compared for a monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and a series of coimpregnated PtSn catalysts containing 1 wt.% of Pt. The pulse chemisorption method gave lower uptakes of hydrogen and oxygen compared to the static volumetric chemisorption method.
The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods. In the coimpregnated catalyst series, the O/Pt ratio increased with increasing Sn content. The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn.
Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior. The alumina-supported catalyst series prepared by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn was compared with a series of catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation with tin first, followed by platinum as second component. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates high Pt dispersion, while sequential impregnation of the support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to much lower Pt dispersion. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Adding tin to platinum catalysts has proven to be benefi- cial for activity maintenance in applications such as catalytic reforming. The catalyst preparation method, especially the impregnation sequence, is known to affect the interaction of tin and platinum. Sexton et al. [1] found that a catalyst prepared by coprecipitation of Sn with alumina followed by impregnation of platinum achieved the maximum contact between Pt and ionic tin. This catalyst also had a uniform distribution of both species. Moreover, it gave the highest activity and selectivity in methylcyclopentane and cyclohex- ane conversion. Dautzenberg et al. [2] observed that the se- quence of metal impregnation was an important factor at low tin content. They concluded that the modification of PtSn alloy was more important than the effect of interaction of Pt with a tin(oxide)-modified support. Baronetti et al. [3] used three different preparation techniques for PtSn/Al2O3 cat- alysts and characterized the samples by diffuse reflectance Corresponding author. Tel.: +662-2184139; fax: +662-2154459.

Their results indicated that there was a strong interaction between Pt and Sn in catalysts prepared by coimpregnation and in catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation with Pt first, where a complex of (PtCl2(SnCl3)2)2was deposited on the alumina surface. However, when the catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation with Sn first, the com- plex formation did not occur, and only Pt(IV) and Sn(IV) species were observed on the alumina surface. The TPR profile of a sequentially impregnated catalyst was similar to the sum of TPR profiles of the two monometallic sam- ples (Pt/Al2O3+Sn/Al2O3). They explained that Sn(II) de- posited during the initial impregnation step was oxidized to Sn(IV) in the drying step, thereby preventing the formation of the (PtCl2(SnCl3)2)2complex when Pt(IV) was added as the second component, due to the weak interaction be- tween (PtCl6)2and (SnCl6)2species.
Many research groups have worked on the character- ization of the state of Sn, using various characterization methods such as chemisorption by static or pulse techniques [414], X-ray diffraction (XRD) [15], X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy (XPS) [1,8,16], Mssbauer spectroscopy [17,18], and TPR [19,20].

alloy formation with a Pt:Sn stoichiometry of 1:1 by in situ
XRD. Li et al. [17] showed that the fraction of Pt present
in an alloy phase increased with increasing tin content, and an alloy richer in Sn than Pt:Sn = 1 : 1 was present on the silica support. Verbeek and Sachtler [21] investigated the surface composition of alloys of platinum and tin by adsorption and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of deuterium and carbon monoxide. Based on TPD results,they referred to the ligand effect, which caused weakening of the chemisorptive bond of deuterium and carbon monox- ide when the proportion of tin in the alloys increased. Static chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen was used for in- vestigating the surface of catalysts by several researchers.
For example, Otter and Dautzenberg [12] studied the effect of hydrogen treatment at high temperatures (>500 C) on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. They attributed the decreasing amount of hydrogen chemisorption after reduction at high temper- atures on highly dispersed platinum particles forming an alloy with the alumina support. Muller et al. [13] observed that the amount of oxygen adsorption on the PtSn bimetal- lic catalysts was proportional to both the percentages of platinum and tin on the alumina support. They found no evidence for the metallic states of Sn or PtSn alloys.
The first objective of this paper was to carry out and com- pare the accuracy of pulse and static hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption techniques on a monometallic Pt/Al2O3 cata- lyst and a series of coimpregnated PtSn catalysts. The sec- ond objective was to evaluate how the preparation method affects Pt dispersion and chemisorption behavior, comparing alumina-supported catalysts prepared by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn with catalysts prepared by sequential impregna- tion with tin first.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
In this work, two series of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were investigated. The first series was prepared by coimpregna- tion of Degussa nonporous fumed alumina (BET surface area of 90 m2/g) with acetone solution of H2PtCl2 (Aldrich) and SnCl2 (Aldrich). This coimpregnated catalyst series has been extensively characterized [8]. The second series was prepared by sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, using the same precursors and solvent as in the previous work [8]. The nominal platinum loading was kept constant at 1 wt.% in all catalysts. In the coimpregnated series, the nominal tin loading varied from
0.1 to 1.0 wt.%. In the sequentially impregnated series, the
nominal tin loading varied from 0.6 to 5 wt.%. Following impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 393 K and then calcined in air at 773 K for 2 h. After calcination, the cat- alysts were reduced for 5 h in flowing hydrogen at 673 K.
The actual platinum, tin and chlorine contents of the cata- lysts were quantified by neutron activation analysis at the Table 1 The metal loadings and chlorine content of PtSn catalysts as determined by neutron activation analysis Catalyst (nominal wt.%) Impregnation method Component (wt.%) Pt Sn Cl

University of Michigan nuclear reactor laboratory. The cata- lyst samples were delivered via pneumatic tube to a location with an average neutron flux rate of 2.13 × 1012 n/(cm2 s) and exposed to irradiation for 1 min, followed by a 500 s count of gamma-activity after a 20 min decay. Calculations of elemental concentrations were based on comparisons with high-purity single-element standard reference materials. A summary of the results of neutron activation analysis is shown in Table 1.
2.2. Pulse chemisorption
Prior to pulse chemisorption, all samples were reduced in purified hydrogen at a flow rate of 15 ml/min for 2 h at 673 K. The temperature was controlled to 1 C by a tem- perature controller (Omega CN8000). The reduced samples were purged in purified nitrogen at 673 K for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature in nitrogen atmosphere.
The chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen was measured by using a gas chromatograph (HP 5890) with a thermal con- ductivity detector (TCD). Gas mixtures of 5% H2/N2 and 5% O2/N2 were used as adsorbates. Injections of these gas mixtures into a N2 carrier gas stream flowing at 30 ml/min were made in 5 min intervals until no further gas uptake by the catalyst was observed as indicated by constant peak ar- eas of the last few injections. The total amount of adsorp- tion was calculated by adding the gas uptake observed in the series of gas injections until saturation was reached.
2.3. Static volumetric chemisorption
The details of the static volumetric chemisorption ex- periments have been described previously [8]. The cata- lysts were pre-reduced in a hydrogen flow of 15 cm3/min at 673 K, followed by evacuation and static reduction at 673 K in a partial pressure of 33.3 kPa of research-grade H2 for 3 h, followed by evacuation and a second exposure to
33.3 kPa of H2 for 10 h at 673 K. Hydrogen was removed
from the catalyst surface by evacuation at 693 K, followed by cooling of the catalyst sample to ambient temperature under dynamic vacuum. For both H2 and O2, two adsorption isotherms were collected. The first isotherm represented the

101 total H2 or O2 uptake at 298 K. The second isotherm was obtained after removing the weakly adsorbed hydrogen or oxygen by evacuation at 298 K for 1 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparison of pulse chemisorption and static
chemisorption Table 2 shows the summary results of the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen adsorbed on the two series of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts using pulse chemisorption technique.
The H/Pt ratio in the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was
0.28. The coimpregnated sample containing 0.1 wt.% Sn
exhibited a much larger hydrogen uptake, giving a H/Pt ratio of about 0.46, assuming that all the chemisorbed hydrogen is located on platinum surface sites. However,with further increase of tin content, the hydrogen uptake decreased, giving H/Pt ratios of about 0.3. These results show the same overall trends for hydrogen uptake versus tin content as the previous static volumetric chemisorption data reported by Balakrishnan and Schwank [8] for the Table 2 Pulse chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen on two series of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts compared with Pt/Al2O3 catalyst Metal (wt.%) Sn (at.%) Sn/Pt (atomic ratio) Gas uptake (cm3 STP/g cat.)

However, the amount of hydrogen uptake measured by the pulse chemisorption method was consistently lower by 1020% than the uptake obtained by the static volumetric method (Fig. 1). These findings are in good agreement with Buyanova et al. [4,5] who compared a frontal chromatographic method with the static adsorption method. They found that on Pt/Al2O3 cat- alysts with Pt loadings of 0.50 and 0.45 wt.%, the hydrogen uptake determined from the chromatographic method was 619% smaller than that obtained by the static method.
Some of the differences in hydrogen uptake between the pulse and static methods may be attributed to small errors in the integration of the pulse chemisorption peak areas due to slight baseline drift. However, error analysis showed that in a worst-case scenario, these integration errors could cause not more than a 5% discrepancy. The remaining difference,therefore, would be inherently to the chemisorption method used. One of the differences accounting for the larger hy- drogen uptake in static volumetric experiments could be the longer equilibration time provided. In Balakrishnan and Schwanks work [8], a significant portion of the adsorbed hydrogen was found to be weakly adsorbed. In their exper- iments, 4045% of the adsorbed hydrogen was removed by 102

evacuation for 1 h at room temperature. In the pulse exper- iments, the catalyst samples were flushed in flowing N2 at room temperature for about 5 min between pulses of hy- drogen. This means there is no equilibration time in pulse chemisorption. Given the relatively large fraction of weakly adsorbed hydrogen observed by static volumetric methods,it is conceivable that the experimental conditions in the pulse method might lead to different degrees of surface coverage of weakly adsorbed hydrogen.
On the monometallic 1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the static volumetric method gave an atomic ratio of adsorbed oxy- gen to adsorbed hydrogen (Oads/Hads) equal to 0.73. In the pulse chemisorption method, the Oads/Hads ratio was 0.71,showing good agreement between the two methods. It ap- pears that the saturation coverage of oxygen on platinum is smaller than that of hydrogen. This observation agrees with the earlier work by Boudart and coworkers [22] reporting an Oads/Hads ratio of 0.65 on unsupported platinum powder,and by Balakrishnan et al. [23] giving an Oads/Hads ratio of 0.68 on Pt/SiO2. Since a large fraction of the adsorbed hydrogen was weakly adsorbed [8], these weakly adsorbed hydrogen species should have higher mobility than the more strongly adsorbed oxygen [24].
While in the pulse chemisorption experiments hydrogen adsorption required several pulses to reach saturation, oxy- gen adsorption reached saturation already during the first pulse of gas. Subsequent pulses of oxygen did not lead to additional uptakes of oxygen. These differences between hy- drogen and oxygen adsorption might be linked to the dif- ferent degrees of weak adsorption (4045% of weakly held hydrogen, and only 12% weakly held oxygen) [8]. The oxygen uptake values measured by the pulse method on all the bimetallic PtSn samples were again lower than those observed by static chemisorption experiments, similar to the observation made in hydrogen chemisorption (Fig. 2).
In contrast to our pulse chemisorption results, the chro- matographic method used by Buyanova et al. [5] gave a slightly higher amount of adsorbed oxygen than the static method. The main difference between the static method and the chromatographic method is that the chromatographic Fig. 2. Comparison of oxygen uptake measured by the pulse and static volumetric chemisorption methods as a function of nominal tin loading. method exposes the catalyst to flowing oxygen at essentially constant partial pressure. In a static adsorption experiment,on the other hand, the partial pressure of oxygen will grad- ually decrease, until adsorption equilibrium is established.
Buyanova et al. [5] mentioned that their frontal chromato- graphic method could only be used for rough estimates.
With increasing tin content of the coimpregnated catalysts, both the static and the pulse methods showed a systematic increase of oxygen uptake (Fig. 2). The in- creased oxygen uptake as a function of tin content may be attributed to several possible reasons. One possibility is that chemisorbed oxygen can spill over from platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, which may be present in the form of tinaluminate surface complexes. Another possibility may be that the adsorption stoichiometry for oxygen on platinum is changed by the presence of adjacent tin ions. Further- more, it is well known that oxygen can be adsorbed on metallic tin, but not on ionic tin. One could argue that the increased oxygen uptake with increasing tin content may be due to increased levels of metallic tin in the catalysts with higher tin loading. Lieske and Vlter [7] purposed the for- mation of platinumtin alloy by assuming that metallic tin is transformed into SnO by oxidation and that the presence of tin does not affect the oxygen adsorption on the platinum sites. They concluded that the amount of platinumtin alloy increases with the addition of tin. However, the XPS results obtained on our coimpregnated PtSn catalyst series [8] did not give evidence for the presence of zero valent tin.
It is likely that tinaluminate complexes are present, which could change the oxygen adsorption characteristics com- pared to catalysts where there is no interaction of alumina and tin. Similarly, platinumtin alloy particles may adsorb oxygen in a different way compared to individual particles of metallic platinum and tin.

The H/Pt atomic ratios of the sequentially impreg- nated catalysts show that the platinum dispersion values are relatively small as compared to those of the coimpregnated catalysts. The significantly smaller hydrogen uptake in the sequential impregnation series indicates that deposition of tin as first component on the alumina support is detrimen- tal for the dispersion of platinum, while coimpregnation appears to facilitate high platinum dispersions. After reduc- tion in H2 at 400 C, the sequentially impregnated catalysts contained a slightly higher amount of residual chlorine,compared to the coimpregnated catalysts (see Table 1).
However, these small differences in chlorine content should not have significant effects on the chemisorption behavior and platinum dispersion.
In the sequentially impregnated catalysts, the effect of tin loading on enhanced oxygen uptake was much less pro- nounced as compared to the coimpregnated catalyst series (Fig. 4). On the catalyst sample with very large Sn con- tent (1.0 wt.% Pt5.0 wt.% Sn/Al2O3), the uptakes of both oxygen and hydrogen were very low indicating low disper- sion of platinum. High resolution electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy results showed a cer- tain proportion of the metal particles were somewhat larger and there was evidence of the formation of PtSn alloy in the sequentially impregnated catalysts [25].
It appears that oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed plat- inum particles can spillover onto tinaluminate complex sit- uating the nearby platinum atoms, thus causing larger O/Pt ratios than H/Pt ratios in the bimetallic catalysts with high Pt dispersion. This explanation is also consistent with the XPS analysis of the coimpregnated catalyst series with high Pt dispersion, indicating that in the reduced alumina-supported PtSn catalysts, Sn is primarily present in a state of Sn(II) or Sn(IV) [8].
4. Conclusions
Comparing static volumetric chemisorption data with the pulse chemisorption data shows agreement in the qualitative trends. On monometallic Pt/Al2O3, the static method gives 104

an Oads/Hads ratio equal to 0.73, in excellent agreement with the pulse chemisorption method, where the Oads/Hads ratio is 0.71. In the coimpregnated PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst series,the H/Pt ratio goes through a maximum for the catalyst with
0.1 wt.% Sn, both for the static as well as the pulse method.
In both methods, the O/Pt ratio increases with increasing Sn content. However, the pulse chemisorption method gives consistently lower uptakes of hydrogen and oxygen com- pared to the static volumetric method. These differences in gas uptake might be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods.
The method of catalyst preparation has great influence over the metal dispersion and adsorption behavior. Coim- pregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt disper- sion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading. However, sequential im- pregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion, as evidenced by consistently lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios as compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall Pt and Sn loading.
In the tin containing catalysts, the O/Pt ratios obtained are consistently higher than the H/Pt ratios, showing a trend towards enhanced oxygen uptake with increasing Sn con- tent. It appears that oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can migrate from the platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, populating the Sn surface. Sn is in a state of Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV), according to XPS results. This en- hancement of oxygen uptake is not observed on catalysts containing large amount of tin, but low platinum dispersion,suggesting that the presence of highly dispersed platinum is required for populating nearby tin sites with oxygen.
