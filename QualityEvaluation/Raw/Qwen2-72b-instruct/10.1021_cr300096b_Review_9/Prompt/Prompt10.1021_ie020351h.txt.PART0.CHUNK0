Open PDF Abstract We review synthesis, structural characterization, and catalysis by supported bimetallic clusters. Initial steps in the preparations include (a) adsorption of molecular metal clusters with preformed metalmetal bonds; (b) synthesis in zeolite cages; and (c) adsorption of a metal complex on a supported complex or cluster of another metal. Chemisorption capacities of supported oxophilic metalnoble metal clusters for hydrogen and CO are typically less than those of supported clusters of just the noble metal. Catalytic properties distinguishing supported bimetallic clusters from monometallics include high selectivities for oxygenates in CO hydrogenation and different selectivities for CO vs CC bond hydrogenation. Advantages of precise synthesis with organometallic precursors (smallness and uniformity of the supported clusters with bonds between the two metals) are offset by the expensive preparations and difficulty of catalyst regeneration. Applications of supported bimetallic clusters are most likely in specialty chemicals production or with stable combinations of oxophilic and noble metals.

1. Introduction
Supported metals are among the most important catalysts used in technology and, increasingly, these are bimetallic, usually incorporating at least one metal from the platinum group. Supported bimetallics used in large-scale processes include the RePt, SnPt, and IrPt catalysts for naphtha reforming and the RhPt and other catalysts for conversion of automobile exhaust.
The catalytic behavior of a supported metal is influenced by the size of the metal particles and by their interactions with the support and other catalyst components such as a second catalytic metal, which could be a promoter. The second metal may influence the first metal through electronic interactions or be involved in the reaction by bonding directly to reactants or intermediates. Often, the interactions between the two metals are complex and largely unknown, and consequently there are excellent opportunities for preparing bimetallic catalysts with new properties.
Sinfelt and co-workers (1,2) reported extensive investigations of supported catalysts incorporating combinations of metals, including Ni, Ru, Os, Pt, Ru, Pd, Cu, and Au. Some of these metals are miscible in the bulk and some are not. A pair of metals that is not miscible in the bulk may form monophasic alloylike structures if the particles are small enough; thus, supported bimetallics that are highly dispersed provide opportunities for new structures and catalytic properties that are not available when the metals are in low dispersions. (1,2) It was found that highly dispersed supported CuNi or CuRu catalysts are several orders of magnitude less active than Ni or Ru alone, respectively, for hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons. (1,3) Cu markedly affects the activity of the highly dispersed catalysts for hydrogenolysis, whereas it only slightly affects the activity for cyclohexane hydrogenation. (1) Such observations by the Sinfelt group1,3 and others 4 led to the insight that some catalytic reactions require ensembles (e.g., of Ru atoms or Ni atoms for hydrogenolysis) that incorporate a certain number of metal atoms in a specific coordination, although other reactions (such as hydrogenation) have no such requirements, perhaps requiring only single metal atoms as catalytic sites.
The second metal may substantially suppress the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed on the surfaces of bimetallic particles, much as it affects the catalytic properties for some reactions. (1,4) Such results demonstrate connections between chemisorption and catalytic reaction on bimetallic particles. (1,4) Some bimetallic catalysts have better thermal stabilities and resistance to deactivation than catalysts incorporating only the single metals. For example, supported IrPt catalysts are more resistant to oxidative agglomeration than supported Ir catalysts, (1) and supported RePt catalysts are more tolerant of carbonaceous residues than supported Pt. (1,5,6) A reactive atmosphere may substantially influence the surface composition of a bimetallic particle. If reactants interact strongly as ligands with just one of the metals, the surface tends to be enriched in that metal even when it is not predominant on the surface in an inert atmosphere. (1) The differences between bulk and surface structures of bimetallics are expected to increase with decreasing particle size. It is the uniqueness of structure and reactivity that provides much of the motivation for investigation of the most highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts.
These catalystsbimetallic clustersare the focus of the following review, in which we summarize recent work on (a) preparation methods, (b) structural characterization, with emphasis on the interactions between the two metals and between the metals and the supports, and (c) evidence of new catalytic properties. Sinfelt defined bimetallic clusters as highly dispersed metallic entities having an average size of about 1050 Å. (1) In this review we focus on bimetallic species smaller than about 10 Å in diameter and incorporating only tens of atoms or fewer, and in the following we restrict the term cluster to such small species, using the terms aggregate and particle for larger species. Some of the smallest supported bimetallic clusters have relatively simple and uniform structures, and we emphasize them because they provide a particularly good basis for understanding of the structures and their influence on the catalytic properties; they also offer good prospects as selective catalysts.
2. Preparation of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts
Procedures summarized here for the preparation of supported catalysts incorporating more than one metal are classified as follows: (a) conventional impregnation of the support with metal salts or other metal-containing compounds, (b) assembly of bimetallic species on the support by controlled surface reactions, (c) ship-in-a-bottle synthesis of bimetallic clusters in zeolite cages, and (d) synthesis of clusters on supports from molecular heterometallic cluster precursors. These initial preparation steps are usually followed by further treatments to activate the catalyst.
2.1. Conventional Impregnation Techniques. Sequential adsorption, ion exchange, or deposition of two precursors from solution (almost always aqueous) on the support and, alternatively, incipient wetness impregnation of the support with a solution of the precursors are the most rapid, inexpensive, and frequently used procedures for preparation of supported bimetallic catalysts. The preparations are simple and do not require complicated equipment. The influence of the temperature, pH, solvent, etc., on the processes is described elsewhere. (7) Because the metal particles in catalysts prepared by these conventional methods are often relatively large in comparison with the clusters that are the focus of this review, we describe the preparations only briefly. The terms used here apply to the procedures employed rather than to specifics of the surface chemistry.
Typically, the precursors in solution do not interact strongly with each other, and so the selective formation of bimetallic species is not expected during the deposition or impregnation step. However, in the next preparation step(s), when the sample is usually calcined and/or reduced at elevated temperatures, supported species typically have enough mobility to migrate on the support, interact with each other, and form bimetallic particles. Low concentrations of bimetallic species on the support and varied compositions of these species (present in mixtures with monometallic species) make it difficult to identify them and determine their structures precisely. Consequently, there is much to be learned yet about the structurecatalytic property relationships of these materials. We neglect them here; the literature4 provides more information.
2.2. Controlled Assembly of Bimetallic Species on Oxide Surfaces. Significant effects of a second metal on catalytic and other properties of a supported metal are anticipated when the interactions between the two metals are maximized. Of particular interest are bimetallics prepared by sequences of surface reactions designed to create these interactions.
One such method for preparing highly dispersed bimetallics involves the anchoring of a complex of a noble metal to the low-valent cations of an oxophilic metal grafted to a support. (8) The method (Figure 1) is illustrated for the formation of ZrPd sites formed in a sequence of reactions taking place on a silica support. The procedure involves several steps, the first being the interaction of the metal complex incorporating the first element [in this case Zr(C3H5)4] in an organic solvent (n-pentane) with the surface hydroxyl groups of silica. The reaction typically leads to the formation of site-isolated metal complexes with covalent bonds between the metal ion and oxygen atoms of the support. The formation of the surface metal complex is often accompanied by the release into the liquid or gas phase of ligands or species formed from them (and possibly from surface groups). In the example of Figure 1, the species released are formed from allyl ligands and surface OH groups. (8) Depending on the reactivity of the metal complex, the reaction with surface hydroxyl groups may be sufficient to give a support surface covered with a monolayer of the metal complex.
Figure 1 Figure 1. Schematic representation of the controlled assembly of bimetallic species on oxide surfaces.
Subsequent treatment in H2 at elevated temperatures may be carried out to remove organic ligands from the supported metal complex and to form low-valent coordinatively unsaturated cations bonded to the support. It is essential that the covalent bonds between the metal ions and the oxygen atoms of the support be strong if the metal complex is to be anchored during the treatment. Coordinatively unsaturated cations stabilized by their attachment to a relatively rigid support are evidently highly reactive surface functional groups.
These surface cations can interact with complexes of a group VIII metal (e.g., Ni, Pd, Pt, etc.) to form adducts (Figure 1) incorporating two metals. The bonding between the two metals should be strong enough to keep the bimetallic complex intact after removal of the ligands, which is usually required for activation of the catalyst.
This kind of catalyst preparation, like the others described below, must usually be carried out in the presence of nonaqueous solvents or with gas-phase reactants and under conditions that minimize contamination with air or moisture. The concentration of bimetallic sites in a catalyst prepared in this way may be much higher than that in a sample made conventionally.
It is crucial for the success of such a preparation that the second metal complex introduced onto the surface react selectively with the metal centers already anchored to the support rather than with the support itself. It is difficult to prepare the first anchored surface species so selectively that all of the metal atoms are bonded firmly to the support and all of the reactive hydroxyl groups of the support are removed; if the latter remain, they are a potential target for the second metal complex. Consequently, monometallic species are potential contaminants in the catalysts. Supported bimetallics formed by this method may be treated in H2 to give bimetallic clusters or particles (Figure 1), which might be quite small. They are not generally expected to be uniform in structure, as are formed by migration and aggregation on the support surface.
A related approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported bimetallics involves the reaction of metal complexes with supported metal clusters or particles. The method is based on the idea that by careful choice of the metal complex and control of the reaction parameters it may be possible to cause the metal complex to react selectively with the supported metal but not with the support surface. (9) For example, interactions of the complex Sn(C4H9)4 with the surface hydroxyl groups of SiO2, γ-Al2O3, or silicaalumina are observed at temperatures of about 150 C or higher, but the reaction of the tin complex with reduced metal particles on the supports takes place even at room temperature. (9) Thus, the selective preparation of the bimetallic is carried out at temperatures between room temperature and 150 C.
Such a catalyst preparation procedure typically includes several steps, as shown schematically in Figure 2. First, supported clusters of the noble metal are formed on the support (e.g., SiO2, γ-Al2O3) from anchored noble metal complexes that are treated (typically in H2 or under vacuum at elevated temperatures or by a sequence of oxidation and reduction steps) to effect ligand removal and aggregation of the metal. Subsequent contact of the sample with Sn(C4H9)4 results first in physisorption of Sn(C4H9)4 on the support [a result of van der Waals interactions between the support hydroxyl groups and the butyl groups; this interpretation is supported by IR spectra of the species on SiO2, for which a strong shift to lower wavenumbers of the νOH band (from 3760 to 3700 cm-1) was observed]. (9) The physisorbed complex migrates from the support to the metal surface, for which it has a strong affinity. (9) Butyl ligands on the tin can then be removed by thermal treatment, leading to the formation of dibutyl, monobutyl, and even totally debutylated tin species on the metal clusters. The resultant materials could incorporate tin either on or within the noble metal clusters. In either case, the interactions between tin and the noble metal atoms are expected to remain intact after dealkylation of the tin species.
Figure 2 Figure 2. Synthesis of bimetallics by reaction of Sn(n-C4H9)4 with supported metal clusters.
Depending on the size of the noble metal clusters or particles, it is possible to prepare samples in which the noble metal is covered with as much as nearly a monolayer of tin. Sn/Pts ratios (the subscript s refers to surface) as high as 3 can be obtained in a catalyst made from Pt/SiO2 without substantial introduction of tin onto the support. (10) These results suggest that, in the presence of excess tin tetraalkyl, further anchoring reactions take place that lead to multilayer coverage of the Pt by tin tetraalkyl. On the basis of observations that the formation of multilayers is strongly enhanced in the presence of H2, it was suggested that H2 reacts with the monolayer tin alkyl to cause dealkylation and formation of coordinatively unsaturated tin species in the first layer that are capable of interacting readily with tetraalkyltin to form a second layer, and so forth.
Removal of ligands from such multilayered bimetallic structures by treatment in H2 led to the formation of supported bimetallics having unique catalytic properties, and oxygen treatment resulted in a new catalytic material in which supported Pt clusters are believed to be covered by tin cations. (10) The catalytic properties are summarized in a following section.
2.3. Ship-in-a-Bottle Synthesis of Bimetallic Clusters in Zeolites. Zeolites are appealing supports for the preparation of extremely small and uniform metal clusters because their well-defined crystalline structures provide matrixes for the synthesis of highly dispersed (and potentially structurally simple) catalysts. Faujasite supercages are approximately 12.5 Å in diameter and separated by apertures with diameters of about 7.5 Å. A precursor small enough to pass through the apertures is sorbed in the supercages of a zeolite, and subsequent treatment may lead to the formation of larger metal clusters or particles. These are, in prospect, limited in size by the supercage diameter, and they may be too large to pass through the apertures, becoming trapped in the cages. Complications may arise as smaller species are transported out of the zeolite pores and onto the exterior surfaces or as the encaged structures grow too large to fit and cause the zeolite crystallites to burst.
For example, bulky metal carbonyl clusters such as Ir4(CO)12 and Rh6(CO)16, with diameters of about 9 and 12 Å, respectively, cannot be introduced directly into the pores of faujasites because the apertures are too small. However, these clusters can be synthesized in the cages by the reductive carbonylation of smaller molecular precursors such as Ir(CO)2(acac) or Rh(CO)2(acac), which diffuse readily into the cages. (11) Bimetallic clusters also can be assembled in zeolite cages. For example, Rh6-xIrx(CO)16 clusters of various compositions (with x ranging from 1 to 4) were evidently prepared by the reductive carbonylation at temperatures in the range of 150227 C of Rh3+ and Ir4+ that had been introduced into zeolite NaY by ion exchange. (1214) Decarbonylation of these clusters in O2 followed by reduction with H2 at 450 C led to the formation of highly dispersed RhIr clusters.
Ship-in-a-bottle syntheses of bimetallic carbonyl species in zeolites have been reported for various precursors. For example, infrared data indicate the reductive carbonylation of Ru3+ exchange ions in zeolite NaY or zeolite NaX, together with Co2(CO)8 that had been deposited in the zeolite pores from a pentane solution; treatment with a mixture of CO and H2 at 50 C is inferred to have resulted in the formation of HRuCo3(CO)12. (15) Similarly, [Rh4Fe2(CO)16]2- entrapped in zeolite NaY was evidently made by the interaction of Fe2(CO)9 and zeolite-anchored Rh(CO)2 species formed from Rh4(CO)12 at 80 C in a vacuum. (13) The decarbonylation of HRuCo3(CO)12 and of [Rh4Fe2(CO)16]2- in zeolites led to the formation of highly dispersed CoRu and FeRh clusters of less than about 10 Å in average diameter.
To form highly dispersed bimetallic species inside the zeolite framework, it is not always necessary to go through a step resulting in the formation of zeolite-entrapped bimetallic carbonyls. 129Xe NMR and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra show that simultaneous ion exchange of Cu2+ and Pt(NH3)42+ into zeolite NaY followed by treatments in O2 and H2 at 300 C led to the formation of CuPt clusters with Cu atoms concentrated on the surface. (16) RePt clusters in the supercages of zeolite NaY were made by chemical vapor deposition of Re2(CO)10 on prereduced Pt clusters acting as nucleation sites for the decomposition of the metal carbonyl. (17) Thus, the available data indicate that the zeolite entrapment techniques provide efficient methods for preparing highly dispersed supported bimetallics in high yields, higher than would be expected from conventional catalyst preparations.
2.4. Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts from Molecular Cluster Precursors. The use of molecular bimetallic clusters with preformed bonds between metals of different properties is another promising method for the preparation of highly dispersed supported bimetallic catalysts. Cluster compounds can potentially be formed from many elements of the periodic table. Recent developments in synthetic organometallic chemistry provide a wide variety of heteroatomic metal clusters of various sizes incorporating two or even three different metals bonded to each other. (18)
Besides preformed metalmetal bonds, the molecular bimetallic cluster precursors offer other advantages. Typically, they incorporate metals in low oxidation states, so that relatively low temperatures can be used in the catalyst activation steps, such as those to remove ligands from the metals and possibly reduce them; consequently, the metalmetal bonds may be preserved. Depending on the cluster composition, potential contaminants or poisons of the catalyst remaining from precursor ligands containing chlorine, phosphorus, or sulfur might be removed as well (this topic is addressed below). Furthermore, geometric features of bimetallic cluster precursors could in prospect be retained in the supported bimetallic catalysts, perhaps resulting in well-dispersed and nearly uniform bimetallic species, which might be expected to be selective catalysts.
This catalyst preparation method typically involves the adsorption of a bimetallic cluster precursor on a support followed by an activation step, intended to remove ligands from the cluster frame, usually by treatment in an inert atmosphere or H2. It is often considered desirable to maintain the heteroatomic metal cluster frame on the support to maximize the metal dispersion and the interactions between the two metals. A number of examples of relatively precise syntheses that (nearly) meet this goal have been reported; because they are a principal focus of this review, they are addressed in several of the following sections. In this section, we address the more complicated (and typical) preparations that lead to substantial changes in the metal frame as supported bimetallics are prepared from molecular bimetallic precursors.
Meeting the goal of precise synthesis without changes in the metal frame is challenging, because either the adsorption or the activation step may lead to cluster breakup and possibly aggregation of the metals on the support. For example, Me3SnCo(CO)4 (Me is methyl) was adsorbed in zeolite NaY without substantial breaking of the SnCo bond and then decarbonylated in a vacuum at 300 C with formation of alloylike SnCo species incorporating not more than about 10 atoms each, as shown by EXAFS spectra; evidently, only slight aggregation of the metal occurred. (19) However, contrasting examples illustrate that the cluster frame may be drastically altered and that the interactions of the bimetallic cluster precursor with a support often result in structural and chemical modifications. For example, disintegration of the metal cluster frame was observed for Fe2Ru(CO)12, FeRu2(CO)12, and H2FeRu3(CO)13 on γ-Al2O3; the resulting supported species were Run+(CO)2 complexes and Fen+ ions. (20) In the other cases, the interaction of the cluster precursor with the support results in increased cluster nuclearity (the number of metal atoms in the cluster), presumably sometimes preceded by cluster breakup. For example, RuCo2(CO)11 transforms readily into RuCo3(CO)12 on γ-Al2O3. (21) Pt3(μ-CO)3(PPh3)3 is converted into Pt5(μ-CO)5(CO)(PPh3)4, with the conversion being dependent on the nature and pretreatment of the supportand even the type of solvent used in the impregnation step. (22) In more extreme (but not unusual) cases, the clusters aggregate into rather large metal particles.
The fact that a cluster precursor may be adsorbed intact on a support does not necessarily imply that the bimetallic interaction is preserved during ligand removal. For example, EXAFS data show that [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir4(CO)16] and [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir2(CO)12] (Et is ethyl) could be adsorbed intact on MgO and decarbonylated in H2 at 350 C, with the FeIr cluster frame being largely retained. (23) On the other hand, when the support was SiO2, the treatment in H2 led to complete disintegration of the FeIr cluster frame and formation of aggregated particles of Fe and Ir metal, largely segregated from each other. (23) These examples demonstrate that the preparation of highly dispersed supported bimetallic catalysts from molecular bimetallic cluster precursors is challenging and typically requires precise syntheses, usually found by trial-and-error experimentation.
3. Structures and Properties of Supported Bimetallic Clusters
3.1.Clusters of Group VIII Metals. Among the supported bimetallics that are best investigated and most like monophasic alloys are the ones that are relatively large (about 2030 Å or more in diameter) and contain two platinum-group metals (e.g., Ir and Pt). These have properties not greatly different from those of the bulk metals.
Significant differences between bulk bimetallic monophasic alloys and supported bimetallic particles have been demonstrated, (1,24,25) and the differences are expected to increase as the particles become smaller (less bulklike) and interact more strongly with the supports. Lots of new territory remains to be charted in the realm of the smallest clusters. Supported clusters of two group VIII metals that are too small to have bulklike properties are largely unexplored.
There are only a few reports of extremely small bimetallic clusters (those with fewer than about 10 metal atoms per cluster) in which both metals belong to the group VIII. Some of the closest approaches to such small clusters are provided by the work of the following:(a) Pignolet's group, (2426) who used PtAu clusters with acetylide ligands to make silica-supported bimetallics. The average aggregates observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were about 25 Å in diameter, containing several tens of atoms. (b) The group of Thomas and Johnson, (27) who used [Pd6Ru6(CO)24]2- to make mesoporous silica-supported aggregates, found by TEM and EXAFS spectroscopy to be about 17 Å in average diameter. (c) Hills et al., (28) who used PtRu5C(CO)16 and also Pt2Ru4(CO)18 to make supported bimetallics, which again were relatively large in our context (1015 Å in average diameter).In contrast, extremely small γ-Al2O3-supported RuPt clusters were made by decarbonylation of molecularly adsorbed Pt2Ru4(CO)18 on γ-Al2O3 in He or H2 at temperatures in the range of 300400 C. (29) Infrared and EXAFS data show that the majority of the bimetallic cluster precursors were only weakly adsorbed on γ-Al2O3, interacting by hydrogen bonding through their carbonyl ligands with support hydroxyl groups. The weakness of the clustersupport interactions allowed retention of the cluster frame in the supported clusters (which could be recovered from the surface by extraction with CH2Cl2). The data also indicate that a minority of the bimetallic clusters interacted strongly with the support, likely forming some partially decarbonylated surface species of unknown structure as a result of nucleophilic displacement of carbonyl ligands by surface hydroxyl groups.Small structural changes of the cluster core occurred upon decarbonylation in He or H2 at 300400 C, as indicated by changes in the PtPt and RuRu bond distances relative to those of the fully carbonylated clusters. The average PtPt bond distance increased from 2.66 to 2.69 Å, and the RuRu distance decreased from 2.83 to 2.64 Å. Nevertheless, the bimetallic cluster frame remained only slightly changed after full decarbonylation, as evidenced by the presence of strong RuPt EXAFS contributions observed at both Pt LIII and Ru K edges. Average PtPt and RuRu coordination numbers characterizing the decarbonylated species were found to be only 2.0 and 4.0, respectively, signifying extremely high dispersions of the resulting supported bimetallic species. From these coordination numbers, it follows that decarbonylated clusters incorporated, on average, less than three and six Pt and Ru atoms, respectively; these are the smallest supported bimetallic clusters of group VIII metals yet reported. The high dispersion is believed to be the result of strong interactions between Pt and Ru atoms and the strong interactions with the γ-Al2O3 support, which limit the surface mobility of the metals.In contrast, Hills et al. (28) used the same precursor and carbons as their supports, and carbon does not bond as strongly to the metals as metal oxides such as γ-Al2O3, which explains the relatively large bimetallic aggregates observed by Hills et al. Evidently, the silica supports used by Pignolet24-26 and Thomas and Johnson27 do not bond very strongly to the metals either, as shown by the aggregation of the metals in their samples.The metals in almost all bimetallics reported in the preceding paragraphs of this section were evidently zerovalent. However, metals in bimetallics may have various oxidation states and interactions with the support, especially when they are present in extremely small clusters. This point is illustrated well by supported bimetallics consisting of metals from different groups in the periodic table, such as a group VI and group VIII metals (e.g., WPt) as discussed in the next section. These are unlikely to be alloylike, because the group VI metal is oxophilic and stable as cations and possibly segregated from the platinum-group metal. Even when both metals are from the platinum group, however, they may have different oxidation states. For example, in auto exhaust catalysts, the supported Rh may be partly cationic and partly zerovalent while the Pt is zerovalent, except at its surface. (30) Even RuPt blacks used in methanol fuel cells are not single-phase metallic materials but instead are mixtures of Pt metal, Pt hydrous oxides, and hydrous and dehydrated RuO2. (31) Only a small fraction of the Ru is present in a metallic form. Nanoscale Pt metalRuOxHy boundaries may be required to achieve high catalytic activity. (31)
3.2.Noble MetalOxophilic Metal Clusters. Supported catalysts made from molecular clusters containing both oxophilic and noble metals have frequently been found, upon activation to remove ligands, to give segregated metals on the support surface. Commonly, the noble metal aggregates into monometallic clusters and the oxophilic metal into oxide-like species. Because there are almost no bimetallic interactions in these materials, we neglect them here.
However, when the preparation conditions are sufficiently mild and the two metals are strongly enough bonded to each other, the oxophilic metalnoble metal bonds may remain largely intact in the activated catalyst. Such catalysts are the subject of the following section.
When a noble metaloxophilic metal combination is present in a supported catalyst and the clusters are extremely small (e.g., less than about 10 atoms each), the two metals may be present in the same clusters. In these catalysts, at least on oxide supports, the oxophilic metal is generally cationic and present largely between the zerovalent noble metal and the support. It evidently has a stronger affinity for the support than for the noble metal.
Illustrations of methods for understanding structures of extremely small bimetallic catalysts are provided by recent work on the noble metaloxophilic metal catalysts reported by several groups. (3239) This work shows the advantages of using organometallic compounds with preformed metalmetal bonds as catalyst precursors. Combinations of metals such as MoPt, WPt, MoPd, and CuRu have been used to prepare some of the smallest known supported bimetallic clusters, including those containing as few as about 46 noble metal atoms. (32,34,36,37) EXAFS data indicate that the bimetallic interactions help to stabilize the noble metal in a highly dispersed state. Some of these clusters are maintained intact even at 400 C in the presence of oxygen. (32) According to structural models (e.g., Figure 3) based on EXAFS data, (32,3437) the oxophilic metal ions are bonded strongly to the support and also to the noble metal, holding it in a kind of nest and stabilizing it. (32) Thus, the dispersion of the noble metal is maintained even under harsh conditions of oxidation or reduction.
Figure 3 Figure 3. Simplified structural model of a bilayer consisting of Mo ions interacting with a MgO support and providing a nest for highly dispersed Pd clusters. According to this model, the cationic Mo is strongly bonded to the support and helps to maintain the dispersion of the Pd.
A similar structural model was proposed for γ-Al2O3-supported RePt catalysts prepared by decarbonylation of Re2Pt(CO)12. (6) On the basis of EXAFS data, the surface species in these samples were modeled as nearly molecular clusters in which Re interacts strongly with the oxygen atoms of the support as well as with the Pt (Figure 4).
Figure 4 Figure 4. Simplified model based on EXAFS data of Re4Pt2 clusters formed on the surface of γ-Al2O3 from Re2Pt(CO)12 clusters. (6) The reports of such small supported bimetallic clusters refer primarily to oxophilic metalplatinum-group metal combinations. The literature makes clear the advantage of bimetallic compounds with preformed metalmetal bonds as precursors of such catalysts; to our knowledge, they have not been made any other way.
4. Chemisorption on Highly Dispersed Bimetallic Clusters
Measurements of the chemisorption of hydrogen and/or CO are commonly made to determine the dispersions of supported metals. Reliable dispersion data can be obtained when the stoichiometry of chemisorption is known. Many relatively simple γ-Al2O3-, MgO-, and SiO2-supported Pt catalysts, for example, chemisorb one H atom or one CO molecule per exposed Pt atom, consistent with dispersions measured by techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), (40) EXAFS spectroscopy, (40) and TEM. (26) The reported chemisorption data indicate that the amount of hydrogen or CO chemisorbed on supported bimetallics of various compositions is substantially less than what might have been expected on the basis of the metal dispersion alone. For example, the H/Pt and CO/Pt values characterizing highly dispersed WPt clusters on γ-Al2O3, prepared from PtW2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PhCN)2 and reduced at 400 C, were found to be 0.12 and 0.16, respectively. (32) Similarly, WPt clusters on γ-Al2O3, made from Pt2W2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PPh3)2, after reduction at 400 C showed H/Pt and CO/Pt values as little as 0.10 and 0.19, respectively. (32) Comparisons of the chemisorption capacities with the Pt dispersions determined by EXAFS spectroscopy for these two catalysts show that the coverage of the Pt was always less than 20 and 50%, respectively, regardless of the treatment conditions. (32) Similarly, low chemisorption capacities were observed for MgO-, SiO2-, and carbon-supported Pt or Pd catalysts incorporating cations of oxophilic metals such as W, Mo, Ti, Zr, and Hf, (8,3237,4143) cations of rare-earth metals such as La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Dy, Ho, Tm, and Yb, (44) or other metals such as Au and Cu. (2426,45) The following generalization is supported by the available data: regardless of the nature of the support, the noble metal, or the second metal, low values of hydrogen and CO chemisorption (relative to what would be expected for the monometallic noble metal catalysts) have generally been observed for highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts derived from molecular cluster precursors or other organometallic compounds. This observation leads to the inference that the chemisorption capacity of a noble metal in an extremely small bimetallic cluster is influenced by the oxophilic metal-noble metal interactions.
It seems to be significant that changes in the evacuation conditions can alter the chemisorptive properties of these materials. For example, when the reduction of CuPt/SiO2 with H2 was followed by evacuation at a temperature lower than the reduction temperature, the chemisorption capacities were typically higher than those characterizing the sample evacuated at the reduction temperature. (25) It was suggested that the high evacuation temperature might have caused some reversible morphological changes in the bimetallic particles whereby the noble metal became buried in the coinage metal. (25) Inasmuch as bimetallic catalysts prepared from organometallic precursors and having noble metaloxophilic metal interactions appear generally to have relatively low chemisorption capacities, it is reasonable to suggest that residues such as carbon resulting from the decomposition of organic ligands or CO during the catalyst activation might have been present and caused some blockage of access of adsorbates to the noble metal surface. However, a series of experiments reported for the molecular cluster-derived WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed that the chemisorptive properties of Pt in these samples were hardly affected by O2/H2 treatments, even at temperatures expected to be high enough to remove any deposits. (32) It was concluded that such deposits were not the cause of the low capacities for chemisorption of hydrogen and CO.
On the other hand, some data32,34 demonstrate that incorporation of W cations in the samples reduces the capacities for hydrogen and CO chemisorption on Pt, with the reductions being maximum for the samples in which Pt and W are in closest contact with each other (as evidenced by EXAFS data). TPD of H2 gave results showing that the molecular cluster-derived WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by narrow and nearly coverage-independent desorption energy distributions that are consistent with the presence of nearly uniform and energetically homogeneous desorption sites in the bimetallic samples, in contrast to those observed for Pt/γ-Al2O3. (46) It was also found that the slope of the nearly linear plot of the logarithm of the preexponential factor for desorption vs desorption energies (indicating a compensation effect) is correlated with the strength of the interactions between W ions and Pt atoms in the samples. (46) Thus, it is seems likely that the WPt interactions at least in part account for the low platinum chemisorption capacities. However, we judge that more research is needed for a better understanding of the low chemisorption capacities.
Several possibilities come to mind to explain them, including an effect of the high metal dispersion. The H to surface metal atom ratios characteristic of supported Pt, for example, approach unity as the particle size becomes smaller, but for some metals (e.g., Ir), values even larger than 1 have been observed. (47) In this regard, reports indicating low H/Ir values for MgO- and γ-Al2O3-supported Ir clusters incorporating only of about four atoms each are of interest. (4851) It is still not evident why such small Ir clusters chemisorb less hydrogen than larger Ir particles or bulk Ir. It was suggested that small Ir clusters dispersed on a support could be regarded as quasi-molecular and not metallic in character, with the properties being different from those of metal particles. (51) However, the question of how small a supported metal cluster should become to lose its metallic properties remains open. Furthermore, it would be premature to rule out the possibility that some carbon from the CO ligands in the precursor remained on these monometallic clusters after decarbonylation. This possibility remains for supported monometallics, because they are not as resistant to sintering as the bimetallics in which the noble metal is nested in oxophilic species (Figures 3 and 4) and therefore cannot be heated to such high temperatures to remove the ligands without loss of structural integrity. However, recent EXAFS data indicate that all of the CO ligands could be removed from monometallic clusters in some samples. (52) Another possibility is that hydrogen from OH groups on the support surfaces migrates onto the metal clusters, where it is tightly held and not removed by evacuation in the pretreatment of the samples for chemisorption measurements (this is reverse spillover of the hydrogen). Thus, the chemisorption data would not reflect the capacities of initially ligand-free clusters.
In summary, the data indicate relatively low chemisorption capacities of supported noble metals interacting with oxophilic metals in small clusters. The reduced capacities may be attributed to the influence of the oxophilic metals, and they suggest that the reactivities of the noble metals in bimetallic clusters incorporating oxophilic metals may be substantially different from those of the supported noble metals alone on the supports. The suggested influence of the second metal on the chemisorption implies an influence of the second metal on the reactivity and catalytic properties of the noble metal.
5. Catalytic Properties of Highly Dispersed Supported Bimetallics
Combinations of metals provide unique catalytic properties that are not available when only single metals are used. In this section, we review recently reported catalytic properties of some of the most highly dispersed supported bimetallic clusters. Our intent is not to identify the best combinations of metals for any particular catalytic reactions but rather to consider various reactions as potential probes to provide evidence of interactions between the metals in bimetallic clusters and to indicate new catalytic properties.
5.1. CO Hydrogenation. Highly dispersed SiO2-supported Ni, Pd, and Pt catalysts incorporating a group IV element such as Ti, Zr, or Hf and prepared by decomposition of supported metal complexes were found to be more active for CO hydrogenation than the corresponding catalysts incorporating only a single noble metal. (43) The selectivity of the reaction was also affected by the second metal. In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane. In catalysis by Pd and Pt, incorporation of the second metal caused the formation of hydrocarbons to be substantially reduced, and the yield of methanol was about 9599% at 250 C and 10 atm. The activities and selectivities of Ni, Pd, and Pt were all found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the second metal, increasing in the following order: Ti < Zr < Hf. (43)
SiO2-supported CoRu clusters (and those supported in zeolites NaY and NaX) prepared from the precursors Ru3Co3C(CO)14, RuCo2(CO)11, and HRuCo3(CO)12 showed substantially higher activities and selectivities for formation of oxygenates such as C1C5 alcohols (e.g., selectivities of up to 38% in CO hydrogenation at 149250 C) than samples incorporating only one metal, even in a highly dispersed form. (15) Similar effects were observed for SiO2-supported FeRh, FePt, and FeIr catalysts derived from metal carbonyl clusters. (14) The MgO-supported ReIr clusters formed by decarbonylation of [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir4(CO)16] and [Et4N]2[Fe2Ir2(CO)12] were also found to be active and selective catalysts for methanol formation from CO at 215250 C. (23) The enhancement of catalytic properties of noble metals in CO hydrogenation, especially for formation of higher alcohols, was associated with the presence of heteroatomic MM bimetallic sites in the catalysts. (14,23) It was suggested14,23 that the close proximity of the metals to each other and their strong interactions not only minimize aggregation of the components but also provide the possibility for activation of CO on bimetallic sites, with C and O atoms simultaneously bonded to the different metals. The presence of C- and O-bonded CO on a catalyst surface appears to be favorable for the rate-determining CO insertion to form alcohols. (14) C- and O-bonded CO species on monometallic catalysts were identified by infrared spectroscopy and attributed to CO adsorbed at the interface where atoms of the metal and cations of the support form a bimetallic adsorption site for bonding with CO. (43,53,54) Such infrared bands have been reported for CO adsorbed on noble metals supported on oxides of transition elements such as TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, V2O5, and La2O3. (5557) On the other hand, such bands were not observed for noble metals supported on oxides of p elements (Al, Zn, Cd, Ga, and Bi) or for bulk metals or supports without metals. (5557) Efforts have been made to validate the assignments of the low-frequency bands attributed to the C- and O-bonded CO. The bonding of C and O to Pt and Ti atoms, respectively, was investigated theoretically for a Pt3Ti alloy, (58) with the results showing that such adsorbed species are stable and that the νCO bands characterizing them are expected at wavenumbers <1800 cm-1. (59) When Mn, Ti, or Zr ions were incorporated in Rh/SiO2, the C- and O-bonded CO gave bands in the range of 16001800 cm-1. (43) Results characterizing organometallic cluster compounds justify the assignment of bands in the region of <1700 cm-1 to vibrations of the CO coordinated to metal atoms by both C and O atoms. (48,49) The existence of MCOM structures was confirmed for various heteronuclear clusters (M = Mo, Fe, and Ru), with characteristic νCO bands in the range of 15001700 cm-1. (60) [C5H5W(CO)3]- interacts with coordinatively unsaturated cations of MgO, γ-Al2O3, and K/γ-Al2O3 via C- and O-bonded CO ligands with characteristic νCO bands in the range of 16101750 cm-1. (61) The νCO of the C- and O-bonded CO species is not sensitive to the nature of the noble or oxophilic metals, but the appearance of such bands in the spectra requires the close proximity of the two. (33) Although the existence of C- and O-bonded CO is well documented by infrared spectroscopy, there are hardly any suggestions in the literature regarding how these species could be formed. It is usually assumed that the interaction between C- and O-bonded CO and metal surfaces involves simple donoracceptor interactions, similar to interactions between CO molecules with single-crystal metal surfaces, on the one hand, and Lewis acid sites of oxide surfaces, on the other. These interactions are often assumed to take place over a wide range of temperatures or adsorbate pressures in a nonactivated fashion.Infrared data demonstrate that terminal and bridging forms of CO on Pt are present even at very low CO pressures. (33) Isotopic exchange between 13CO and CO adsorbed on Pt is virtually instantaneous. (33) On the other hand, infrared spectra characterizing CO adsorbed on WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared from molecular bimetallic clusters do not give evidence of C- and O-bonded CO at pressures of less than 10 Torr, although it is evident at higher CO pressures. (33) These results, together with the observation that the isotopic exchange of the C- and O-bonded species with 13CO is slow, suggest that adsorption of CO in such forms is actually an activated process. A similar suggestion was made for the C- and O-bonded adducts on Rh/Nb/SiO2 (62) on the basis of the observation that such species were detected in the infrared spectra only at temperatures exceeding 143 C.It was suggested that terminal or bridging CO species could be intermediates in the formation of the C- and O-bonded species. Some terminal and/or bridging CO species could be oriented toward the metal surface, with the carbonyl O atom being located closer to the metal atoms. (33) Such an activated state might be an intermediate, allowing the interaction of the carbonyl O atom, for example, with oxophilic W ions located in close proximity to Pt atoms. (33) Therefore, we infer that, although the bands attributed to C- and O-bonded CO are often low in intensity and represent minor surface species, they could still be responsible, at least in part, for the properties of bimetallic catalysts for CO hydrogenation.
5.2. Crotonaldehyde Hydrogenation. The selective hydrogenation of CO groups in compounds incorporating CC groups (to give unsaturated alcohols) is an important practical goal because of the importance of unsaturated alcohols in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. However, hydrogenations giving such products selectively (e.g., crotyl alcohol from crotonaldehyde) are difficult. Thermodynamics favors the hydrogenation of the CC bond, with a standard Gibbs free energy change of 16.9 kcal/mol, vs only 7.3 kcal/mol for hydrogenation of the CO bond. (63) Selectivity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation is influenced by the kinetics, which is influenced by the structures of adsorbed reactants on the catalyst.
The literature suggests that crotonaldehyde can be adsorbed on a metal in a di-σCC coordination (with only the CC bond involved in chemisorption), in a di-σCO mode (with only the CO bond involved), and in a η4 coordination (with both bonds involved). (64,65) The di-σCO adsorption mode apparently favors the formation of the unsaturated alcohol. Typically, the di-σCC and η4 coordinations of crotonaldehyde are the most favored on supported Pt, consistent with the formation of butyraldehyde as the principal catalytic hydrogenation product, independent of the Pt particle size. (63,66) The WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts mentioned above showed higher activities for the formation of crotyl alcohol than similar samples lacking W. Among the bimetallic samples, those prepared from bimetallic cluster precursors were found to be the most active for crotyl alcohol formation. (32) It was suggested that the W ions closely associated with Pt atoms could participate in the chemisorption of crotonaldehyde, perhaps providing the opportunity for the formation of chemisorbed species such as those with C- and O-bonded adsorbates that would facilitate activation of the CO bond as a consequence of a bifunctional interaction with both Pt and W. (53) Thus, the role of the W appeared to be similar to the roles of other added metals modifying Pt for hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. For example, Sn, (67,68) Fe, (69) and Ni (70,71) play such a role, and comparable catalytic properties of Pt/TiO2 arise as a result of high-temperature H2 treatment; modification of the catalytic properties of Ru/SiO2 by addition of potassium promoter was also reported. (66,72) Consequently, it seems plausible that a bifunctional coordination of crotonaldehyde to both Pt and a second metal may facilitate activation of the CO bond. Alternatively, however, there is evidence of structure sensitivity illustrated by the effect of Pt, Rh, and Ru particle sizes on hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (e.g., cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde). (64,73,74) Thus, the effect of W on crotonaldehyde hydrogenation may be comparable to its effect on toluene hydrogenation (described below) and be largely a cluster size effect that reflects the extremely high Pt dispersions in the catalysts made from the bimetallic precursors.
5.3. Alkane Hydrogenolysis. The hydrogenolysis reactions of n-butane and of ethane were investigated as probes of NaY zeolite-supported Rh6-xIrx clusters of various compositions (x = 16) derived from Rh6-xIrx(CO)16. A decrease in the hydrogenolysis activity by 4 orders of magnitude was observed with an increasing number of Ir atoms in the active Rh ensembles. The data were interpreted not simply in terms of the removal of active Rh ensemble sites by incorporation of inactive Ir atoms (a geometric or ensemble size effect) but by drastic changes in the electronic states of the clusters across the metal composition range. (13)
In catalysis by Rh6-xIrx/NaY zeolite, the main product of n-butane hydrogenolysis was ethane (from cleavage of the central CC bond). In contrast, RhFe/NaY zeolite catalysts derived from [Rh4Fe2(CO)16]2- showed higher selectivities for methane and propane, as the reaction proceeded mainly via the cleavage of terminal CC bonds. (13) These data provide evidence that incorporation of a second metal can substantially modify the character of a catalytic site; the results would be bolstered by more evidence of the cluster sizes and identification of the catalytic sites.
The use of a second metal in the catalytic clusters also significantly affects the activity and selectivity for CC bond scission reactions in n-hexane conversion. Highly dispersed CuPt/SiO2 catalysts prepared from Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 were found to be several times more active than Pt/SiO2, with propane being a major product, in contrast to the methane observed with Pt/SiO2. (25) A PtAu/SiO2 catalyst was prepared similarly from Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8; the presence of Au in the sample was found not to affect the catalytic activity substantially for this reaction, but the selectivity pattern remained the same as that observed for CuPt/SiO2, favoring the internal rather than terminal bond scission. (25) The resistance to deactivation of PtAu/SiO2 in the n-hexane conversion was found to be substantially greater than that of CuPt/SiO2 and suggested to be related to the ability of Au to impart different particle morphologies or ensemble geometries that are resistant to deactivation (although experimental evidence to test the suggestion is lacking). It seems perhaps no less likely that the low resistance of CuPt/SiO2 to deactivation could be associated with the participation of Cu atoms in the cracking of CC bonds as a part of bimetallic active sites.
The idea that both components of the bimetallic sites participate in the activation of hydrocarbons had been suggested earlier8 on the basis of observations that the addition of Re, Mo, W, Pb, or Sn to SiO2-supported Rh or Pt clusters decreased the yield of methane in favor of C2C5 hydrocarbons, with the selectivity being strongly dependent on the nature of the metal.
It is noteworthy that the influence of the composition of ligands in the cluster precursor on n-hexane conversion catalysis could be comparable to the influence of the second metal. For example, it was found that SiO2-supported PtAu catalysts, prepared from the phosphorus-containing [Pt(AuPPh3)8](NO3)2 and [Pt(AuPPh3)2(PPh3)2](NO3)2, show high selectivities for dehydrogenation, whereas other reactions, such as cyclization, isomerization, and cracking, were severely inhibited. It was suggested that the residues of the phosphine ligands act as selective poisons for cracking, isomerization, and cyclization reactions. (75) On the other hand, one cannot rule out the possibility that the use of triphenylphosphine-ligated bimetallic precursors results in metal clusters with morphologies different from those of the non-phosphorus-containing catalysts. (75)
5.4. Toluene Hydrogenation. Highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts containing noble metals catalyze toluene hydrogenation, but they are relatively low in activity in comparison with the respective monometallic noble metal catalysts. For example, CuPt/SiO2 and PtAu/SiO2 catalysts derived from molecular metal cluster precursors were found to be about 630 times less active than Pt/SiO2. (26) The specific activities of MgO- and γ-Al2O3-supported WPt and MoPt clusters prepared from Pt[M(CO)3(C5H5)]2(PhCN)2 (where M is W or Mo) were about 15 times less than that characterizing catalysts made by coprecipitation of individual Pt or Pt and W (or Mo) compounds, represented as Pt/γ-Al2O3, W+Pt/γ-Al2O3, or Mo+Pt/γ-Al2O3, respectively. (32,34,36) The WPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst derived from W2Pt2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PPh3)2 showed negligible activity for toluene hydrogenation at 60 C. (32)
The following generalizations follow from the data characterizing these bimetallic catalysts: (a) regardless of the oxide support, relatively low rates of toluene hydrogenation were observed for bimetallic catalysts with high metal dispersions, (b) relatively high electron densities on the noble metals were indicated by the infrared spectra of probe molecules, and (c) low capacities for hydrogen and CO chemisorption were observed.
These effects were suggested to be evidence of the interactions between the metals in the bimetallic clusters. For example, the low concentration of hydrogen on the metal surface during catalysis (expected on the basis of the chemisorption data) could contribute to a low rate of the rate-determining step, believed to be the addition of the first hydrogen atom to the aromatic ring, (76,77) causing the catalytic reaction rate to be lower than that on the noble metal clusters free of bimetallic interactions. Furthermore, increased electron density on the metal resulting from bimetallic interactions would also be expected to slow the presumably fast step of toluene chemisorption on the metal. (76,77) Besides the influence of the second metal, the influence of the metal dispersion on catalysis should not be overlooked. Although toluene hydrogenation is regarded as structure-insensitive (taking place with roughly the same turnover frequencies on the surfaces of metal particles of different sizes), data reported for highly dispersed MgO- and γ-Al2O3-supported Ir clusters indicate that the turnover frequency increased between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude as the average Ir cluster or aggregate size increased from about 5.4 Å to more than about 30 Å. (4851,78) Qualitatively, the data fit the following pattern: as the Ir clusters become larger, their activities increase, until an optimum diameter is reached. (78) Beyond this diameter (roughly 2030 Å), the activity per exposed Ir atom remains constant, consistent with the identification of toluene hydrogenation catalyzed by noble metals as a structure-insensitive reaction. Numerous recent data support the pattern of cluster size effects in catalytic reactions including some regarded as structure insensitive. (7982) The causes of the deviation from the pattern of structure insensitivity for highly dispersed clusters remain to be determined. One might infer that the metalsupport interactions dominate for the smallest clusters, with supports acting as ligands, (83) but not for the larger particles. The support would be expected to affect the electron transfer and/or the morphology of the clusters and particles, with the effects being greatest for the smallest clusters. Thus, it is inappropriate to regard the smallest clusters as comparable to bulk metals.
In summary, catalytic data for a variety of reactions used to test the behavior of supported bimetallics provide indirect but persuasive evidence of the importance of the interactions between the metals. The CO hydrogenation and hydrocarbon conversion reactions might be used as probes to assess the presence of bimetallic interactions in supported catalysts.
6. Physical Evidence of Interactions between Components in Highly Dispersed Bimetallic Clusters
It is essential to test the inference of the importance of bimetallic interactions in these catalysts by physical methods. We focus our attention here on the results of EXAFS spectroscopy, because EXAFS data provide direct information about metalmetal interactions as well as about the structures of supported metal clusters. The importance of EXAFS spectroscopy in the characterization of supported metal cluster catalysts was recognized early by Sinfelt and co-workers. (1) Typically, an EXAFS investigation of supported bimetallic clusters should be based on data collected at two absorption edges, one for each metal in the catalyst. Analysis of the data provides information about the average number of nearest-neighbor atoms of each metal in the bimetallic clusters and interatomic distances.
To be reliable and internally consistent, a fit of the EXAFS data must give parameters meeting the following constraints, first stated by the Sinfelt group: (84) The parameters determined from each edge and characterizing the bimetallic (MM) interactions must have (a) the same bond distances and (b) the same DebyeWaller factors; furthermore, (c) the coordination numbers characterizing the interactions between atoms of different metals (NMM and NMM) and determined from data at each absorption edge must be related to each other by the equation NMM/NMM = nM/nM, where nM and nM are the total numbers of M and M atoms in the sample, respectively. (84)
6.1. Bimetallic Interactions in Supported Cluster Precursors. As a consequence of the large number of parameters that should satisfy the constraints mentioned above, the identification of bimetallic clusters by EXAFS spectroscopy is challenging and requires high-quality data at two absorption edges. There are only few such data available.
The presence of organic ligands surrounding the metal atoms is another complication in the analysis of EXAFS spectra. Only when the ligands have been relatively simple (as in metal carbonyls) have the identifications of supported bimetallic structures been carried out successfully by EXAFS spectroscopy. Most bimetallic cluster precursors18 adsorbed on supports have been identified only by infrared spectroscopy.
For example, species formed by adsorption of Me3SnCo(CO)4 on zeolite NaY were characterized by EXAFS spectroscopy. Analysis of the Co-edge data showed that about four CO ligands remained in the immediate neighborhood of Co, with the CoC and CoO* (O* is carbonyl oxygen) distances being 1.79 and 2.91 Å, respectively. (19) The Sn edge data showed that about 2.8 C atoms were in close proximity to each Sn atom at an average distance of 2.1 Å, consistent with the suggestion that all of the methyl groups remained in each cluster. The SnCo contributions were also detected (at 2.67 Å) at both edges, consistent with the conclusion that the structure of the bimetallic clusters was retained after adsorption. (19) Similarly, EXAFS data indicate that Me3SnMn(CO)4 could be adsorbed intact on zeolite NaY. In contrast, interaction of the cluster with the acidic zeolite HY led to structural changes in the clusters. The clusters became attached to the zeolite framework at the oxygen rings of the supercages through the Sn moiety (by loss of one of the methyl groups), as the SnMn bond and the carbonyl ligands remained intact. (85) Larger clusters in zeolites and on amorphous supports have also been identified by EXAFS spectroscopy. For example, it was concluded that the reductive carbonylation of NaY zeolite-supported Co(CO)4- and Ru+ in an atmosphere of CO and H2 resulted in the formation of encaged species inferred to be HRuCo3(CO)9(μ3-CO)3. (86) The surface species formed by adsorption of Pt2Ru4(CO)18 on γ-Al2O3 were also investigated by EXAFS spectroscopy. XRD data (87) reported for crystalline Pt2Ru4(CO)18 show that the cluster core consists of two Pt atoms bonded to each other at an average distance of 2.67 Å, with each being bonded to three Ru atoms at an average distance of 2.78 Å. The cluster core is stabilized by 18 terminal CO ligands, two bonded to Pt atoms, with average PtC and PtO* distances of 1.83 and 2.97 Å, respectively; the remainder of the CO ligands are bonded to Ru atoms, with average RuC and RuO* distances of 1.93 and 3.07 Å, respectively (Figure 5).
Figure 5 Figure 5. Structure of the crystalline [Pt2Ru4(CO)18] cluster determined by XRD. (87) The Pt L3 edge EXAFS data (Table 1) characterizing the surface species formed by contact of Pt2Ru4(CO)18 with γ-Al2O3 indicate that each Pt atom was in close proximity to at least one Pt atom and three Ru atoms, at average distances of 2.66 and 2.77 Å, respectively. PtC and PtO* contributions indicating the presence of the terminal carbonyl ligands in the immediate neighborhood of Pt atoms were also observed, with average coordination numbers of 1.4 and 1.5 at average distances of 1.83 and 2.92 Å, respectively.

The EXAFS data collected at the Ru K edge complement those acquired at the Pt L3 edge, showing that each Ru atom on average was surrounded by one Ru atom and about 1.6 Pt atoms at average distances of 2.83 and 2.77 Å, respectively. About four CO groups with characteristic RuC and RuO* distances of 1.94 and 3.05 Å, respectively, were also observed in the immediate neighborhood of Ru (Table 1). (29) Thus, the EXAFS results at both the Pt L3 and Ru K edges characterizing the γ-Al2O3-supported surface species formed from Pt2Ru4(CO)18 match, within the expected experimental uncertainty, the XRD data representing solid Pt2Ru4(CO)18. (87) The fact that all of the coordination numbers and bond distances characterizing the PtPt, PtRu, and RuRu interactions in the γ-Al2O3-supported Pt2Ru4(CO)18 were found to be almost the same as those characterizing crystalline Pt2Ru4(CO)18 (Table 2) implies only weak clustersupport interactions. The EXAFS results indicating that only the PtO* and RuO* distances determined for these supported clusters are (slightly) different from those in crystalline Pt2Ru4(CO)18 imply a slight distortion of the ligand environment of Pt2Ru4(CO)18 upon interaction with the support.

In summary, the cited EXAFS data show that some bimetallic clusters are adsorbed intact on supports, with the bimetallic interactions largely maintained in the surface species. In contrast, however, EXAFS data show that some cluster cores are broken up upon adsorption of molecular metal clusters, for example, those of FeRu clusters of various composition on Al2O3. (20) One would infer that the structure of the surface species depends not only on the nature of the cluster precursor but also on the chemistry of the support, including the degree of its hydroxylation, and the strength of clustersupport interactions.
6.2. Structural Changes of Bimetallic Clusters during Decarbonylation. Only rarely have changes of cluster frames been directly observed by EXAFS spectroscopy as ligands were removed from bimetallic clusters. For example, decarbonylation in H2 of PtRu5C(CO)16 and of Pt2Ru4(CO)18, each supported on carbon, gave RuPt aggregates characterized by shorter PtPt and RuRu distances than those determined for the respective crystalline precursors. (28,88,89) Because the decarbonylation of these metal carbonyl clusters was accompanied by the formation of layers of segregated nanoparticles incorporating about 40 Pt and Ru atoms and having average diameters of about 15 Å, the structural changes were associated with the aggregation and formation of alloylike structures, with the metal atoms being packed closer to each other than in the metal carbonyl precursors. (28,88,89)
On the other hand, recent reports indicate that even when γ-Al2O3-supported RuPt samples remained highly dispersed, the PtPt and RuRu contributions characterizing the decarbonylated clusters were substantially different from those of the fully carbonylated species. Specifically, after treatment of γ-Al2O3-supported Pt2Ru4(CO)18 in He or H2 at 300400 C, the PtPt bond distance increased by 0.03 Å and the RuRu bond distance decreased by 0.19 Å relative to the values characterizing the fully carbonylated cluster precursor in the crystalline form or supported on γ-Al2O3 (Table 2). (29) Therefore, we doubt that the observed changes in the metalmetal bonds could be fully accounted for by just the aggregation that resulted from decarbonylation. EXAFS data reported for osmium subcarbonyls on γ-Al2O3 show that the loss of one CO ligand during decarbonylation was accompanied by an increase in the OsOsupport coordination number from nearly 3 to nearly 4, consistent with the suggestion that the lost CO ligand was replaced by an oxygen atom of the support. (90) We suggest that this conclusion can be extended to supported metal carbonyl clusters, so that the loss of a CO ligand could be compensated by increased metalsupport interactions, with the support becoming part of the ligand shell of the (partially) decarbonylated species. Theoretical calculations (91) showing that the energy of the metalOsupport bond is greater than that of the metalCO bond for rhenium subcarbonyls supported on MgO and that the metalsupport (metaloxygen) interface bonds are strong (92,93) reinforce the view of the support as a ligand, which typically is polydentate. The theoretical simulations reported for SiO2-supported [Ru12Cu4C2(CO)32Cl2]2- show that the strong clustersupport interaction results in a structural modification of the cluster core upon removal of carbonyl ligands. (38) Theoretical predictions made for Os5C clusters on MgO (94) and Ir4 clusters on faujasite92 indicate that the removal of the CO ligands leads to contraction of the metalmetal bonds.
The experimental structure parameters determined from the EXAFS data characterizing monometallic metal carbonyl clusters show, for example, that the IrIr bond distance (2.68 Å) characterizing Ir4(CO)12, within the experimental uncertainty, remained the same after adsorption of the cluster on γ-Al2O3 and after subsequent decarbonylation. (95) On the other hand, the RhRh bond distance was observed to shrink from 2.76 to 2.68 Å upon decarbonylation of NaY zeolite-supported Rh6(CO)16. (95) The greatest comparable decrease in the metalmetal bond distance was observed upon decarbonylation of Ru3(CO)12 on various supports (MgO, SiO2, TiO2, and γ-Al2O3), whereby the RuRu bond distance changed from approximately 2.88 to 2.64 Å. (95) Although the computational results give a clear indication that the nature of the ligands as well as the strength of interaction between the metal core and the ligands can strongly affect the cluster morphology, we infer that the identities of the metals in the cluster core also need to be taken into consideration.
6.3. Evidence of Interactions between Components in Supported Bimetallic Clusters after the Removal of Ligands. The removal of organic ligands from supported bimetallics is not only an important step in the transformation of adsorbed species into catalytically active metal clusters, but it also makes the analysis of EXAFS data simpler, because there are fewer backscatterers in the immediate neighborhood of the metals. However, the deligated structures of supported bimetallic species are still relatively complicated and known only approximately. In many cases thermal treatment of supported bimetallics has caused the segregation of the two metals and aggregation leading to the formation of relatively large metal particles. However, in some samples the bimetallic interactions were preserved, with the metals remaining highly dispersed. Such samples are the best candidates for EXAFS investigations, because the more highly dispersed and uniform the samples are, the more precisely their structures can be determined and the more easily the bimetallic interactions separated from other metalmetal interactions.
It appears that the best results available for the determination of such bimetallic structures have been obtained with samples made from molecular bimetallic clusters as precursors. For example, the decarbonylation of γ-Al2O3-supported Re2Pt(CO)12 in H2 at 400 C resulted in the formation of supported clusters approximated as Re4Pt2, which appear to be nearly molecular in character and resemble the metal cluster precursor (Figure 4). The RePt contributions observed at 2.74 Å at both the Re L3 and Pt L3 edges were stable enough to survive the decarbonylation process. Moreover, in these highly dispersed Re4Pt2 species, it was found that the Re atoms interact more strongly with the support than the Pt atoms, as evidenced by ReO contributions, with an average coordination number of 2.4 at an average distance of 2.14 Å. It was inferred that interactions of Re with the support, on the one hand, and with the Pt atoms, on the other hand, helped to keep the RePt bonds intact and to hinder the aggregation of the metals on the support. (6) In more typical cases, the molecular structure of the cluster precursor is not retained following ligand removal; the resulting supported species are typically complex and nonuniform in structure and difficult to characterize. However, the EXAFS characterization of such samples has led to the recognition of patterns similar to those observed for the well-defined γ-Al2O3-supported RePt clusters. For example, a detailed EXAFS investigation of the γ-Al2O3-supported WPt catalysts derived from Pt[W(CO)3(C5H5)]2(PhCN)2 and Pt2W2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PPh3)2 showed that W in either of the bimetallic precursors helped to maintain the Pt in a highly dispersed form during treatment in H2 at 400 C, leading to highly dispersed supported Pt clusters of only about 46 atoms each, on average. The data also indicated substantial WPt interactions at a distance of 2.71 Å. These were detected at both the Pt and W edges, consistent with the suggestion that the WPtW [or Pt(W)2Pt] units in the precursor were largely retained following removal of the ligands by H2 treatment. The WPt interactions were found to be strong enough to survive oxidation/reduction treatments at temperatures as high as 400 C. (32,33) The EXAFS data reported for highly dispersed RuPt clusters supported on γ-Al2O3 show that, regardless of the temperature or environment used to decarbonylate the supported Pt2Ru4(CO)18, the Ru Pt contributions remained, being detected at both the Pt L3 and Ru K edges in the decarbonylated samples. Nonetheless, the cluster frame of γ-Al2O3-supported Pt2Ru4(CO)18 was found to undergo modifications upon decarbonylation. Evidently, the RuPt interactions in the original cluster frame were strong enough to largely survive these changes. (29) Larger bimetallic species have also been formed, for example, by thermal decomposition of Pd2Mo2(C5H5)2(CO)6(PPh3)2, PtW2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PhCN)2, PtMo2(CO)6(C5H5)2(PhCN)2, or [PtMo6O24]8- on MgO, (34,36,37,96) PtRu5C(CO)16 on carbon, (88,89) and [HRu3Co(CO)12] in zeolite NaY, as evidenced by EXAFS spectroscopy. (86) Although the structures of these supported bimetallics were not determined precisely, the EXAFS data reveal the existence of bimetallic interactions (Table 3).

For example, the RuPt bond distance of 2.68 Å observed for the γ-Al2O3-supported and decarbonylated samples derived from Pt2Ru4(CO)18 agrees well with the value of 2.67 Å calculated as a sum of the radii of Pt and Ru in PtPt and RuRu contributions. (29) The earlier EXAFS data reported by Sinfelt et al. (84) for RhIr, CuRh, CuPt, and CuIr combinations also agree with this pattern (Table 4). The results suggest the following generalization: the distance between the two metals is with some generality approximately equal to half of the sum of the distances between the atoms of each individual metal. This generalization could be regarded as an additional approximate constraint to be applied with the other constraints introduced by Sinfelt's group84 to analyze EXAFS data characterizing supported clusters incorporating two metals.
7. Prospects for Application of Bimetallic Catalysts Prepared from Organometallic Precursors
The new classes of catalysts described here are intriguing for the prospects they offer. The uniqueness of bimetallic catalysts prepared from organometallic precursors is attributed in large measure to the bimetallic interactions and the smallness of the supported clusters. Because the investigation of such catalysts is still at an early stage and because there are so many conceivable combinations of metals, supports, and structures of supported bimetallics, it seems fair to infer that many new structures with new catalytic properties remain to be discovered.
However, the preparation of catalysts from organometallic precursors, some of which are themselves difficult to synthesize, is expensive and unappealing for large-scale applications. Applications in the near term seem unlikely, except possibly for processes in which the catalyst cost is not a large fraction of processing and development costs, such as, for example, in pharmaceutical manufacture, especially when a high selectivity can be obtained with a well-formulated catalyst.
Furthermore, most catalysts consisting of small bimetallic clusters on supports have structures that are likely to be difficult to regenerate after they become deactivated. Those with the best prospects for application might be the ones that are unique in structure and also stable enough to withstand repeated treatments in oxygen and hydrogen, which would lead to regeneration by removal of coke. Such catalysts include the oxophilic metalnoble metal combinations in which the oxophilic metal anchors the noble metal to the oxide support and stabilizes it in a high dispersion.
