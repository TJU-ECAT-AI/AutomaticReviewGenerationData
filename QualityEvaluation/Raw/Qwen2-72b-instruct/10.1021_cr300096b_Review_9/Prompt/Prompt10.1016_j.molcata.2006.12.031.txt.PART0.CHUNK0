I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

They were characterized by N2 adsorption at 77 K, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO chemisorption at room temperature. Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon. Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter. Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metalpromoter interaction. Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition. The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst. After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity. Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values. Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart. The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
