I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Copyright  2001 American Chemical Society Subjects what are subjects Catalysis Catalytic Reactions Hydrogenation Redox Reactions Transfer Reactions In the preface to the book, the author states that the book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis. I would disagree on the use of the words experimental guidelines, since there are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation. Reactors are covered in one and a half pagesmostly a list of references to other sourcesand scale-up issues are hardly mentioned, even in the section on nitro reductions.Nevertheless, this is a very useful book, since it covers the topic from an organic chemist's viewpoint (rather than a catalysis expert's view). The chapters are arranged logically by type of reaction (reduction of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles, imines, nitros, acids and esters, aromatics, heterocycles as well as reductive alkylation, and hydrogenolysis. With over 700 pages the coverage is fairly comprehensive, and anyone doing a catalytic hydrogenation should consult the relevant chapter for referencethe detail is excellent and should allow the chemist to choose how to carry out the processI suspect this is what the author intends by the words experimental guidelines.Of course, a major disadvantage of any work on heterogeneous hydrogenation is that synthetic chemists in the lab just want a good synthetic methodthey are not so concerned about whether it is heterogeneous or homogeneous. In fact they would like to compare the two types of hydrogenation. Perhaps the author will now produce a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation.A further disadvantage is that the book's references tend to be towards the older literature, with only a few to the 1990s literaturemost of these are referenced to books derived from conference proceedings or to the author's own work.Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries. The volume will inevitably be compared to Augustine's Heterogeneous Catalysis for the Synthetic Chemist (Marcel Dekker, 1995) which has much more fundamental information about catalysis, catalytic mechanisms, and kinetics.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
