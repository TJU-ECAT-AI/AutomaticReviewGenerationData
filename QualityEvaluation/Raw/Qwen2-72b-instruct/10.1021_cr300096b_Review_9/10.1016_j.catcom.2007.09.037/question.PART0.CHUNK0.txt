Kinetic and characterization results suggest that the active sites are bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species. Of all the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3 is the most active one. At low time-on-stream it has a very high conversion rate, but it decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases under reacting conditions in the aqueous media. The remarkable high activity of this catalyst during the initial stage of the reac- tion makes this system very interesting for further studies on the reaction mechanism including the possibility of regenerating the active sites. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Catalytic denitrification is an efficient technology for water purification [1,2] and many solid catalysts have been reported in the literature [35]. The possible mechanism for the catalytic reduction is through the combination of active sites in bimetallic catalysts [6] where the nitrate is first reduced to nitrite and then the nitrite is reduced to nitrogen or ammonium depending on the selectivity of the catalyst and the pH of the solution. The aim of this work is to relate the catalytic activity of Pt,In catalysts to their physico- chemical properties and analyze how they are affected by the aqueous reaction media.
We have chosen the In,Pt metallic couple because In pro- moted catalysts have good activity for the nitrates conver- sion and a potential high selectivity to N2, as reported by other authors [16]. As a matter of fact, Pru sse et al. [6] pre- sented a second generation of nitrate-reducing catalysts which included In as promoter, also describing new concepts such as the use of formic acid as reductant instead of hydro- gen. On the other hand, in a preliminary screening of differ- ent catalysts we found that Pt(1 wt.%),In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3 has a remarkable initial activity, which decays after some minutes on stream. Therefore, it would also be interesting to get some insight on the origin of this phenomenon.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation. Aque- ous solutions of PtCl4H2 (10.0 mg mL1) and InCl3 (4.6 mg mL1) were added to 2040 mesh Al2O3 pellets 1566-7367/$ - see front matter  2007 Elsevier B.V.

0.5 cc/g) or 2040 mesh SiO2 pellets (AESAR Large Pore,
surface area: 300 m2/g, pore volume: 1 cc/g) at room tem- perature in order to obtain 1 wt% of Pt and 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 1.2 wt% of In. The solids were dried overnight at 120 C and calcined for 2 h, at 500 C .
2.2. Characterization
Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) experi- ments were performed on fresh and used samples in a MICROMERITICS Autochem II measuring the H2 con- sumption with a TCD detector (mV signal) after the drying of the gases in a water-trap using a heating rate of 10 C/ min in a flow of 5% H2/Ar (50 mL/min).
Dynamic CO chemisorption measurements were carried out by sending 250-ll pulses of 2.5% CO/N2 on 0.10 g sam- ples of fresh and used catalysts, after reduction in H2 for 1 h at 450 C.
X-ray diffractometer profiles were acquired with a Shi- madzu XC-D1 diffractometer using CuKa radiation and monochromator with a scan velocity of 1/min.
The X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) was performed with an Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos Tech.). The spectra were excited by the monochromatized AlKa source (1486.6 eV) run at 15 kV and 10 mA.
2.3. Reaction experiments
The catalysts were pretreated under a flow of H2 (100 mL min1) at 450 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1. Then, a stirred batch reactor was loaded with
80.0 mL of distilled water, 200 mg of catalyst, and 100 N-
ppm of nitrate as initial concentration. Subsequently, a hydrogen flow of 400 ml min1 was fed to the batch reac- tor. A pH of ca. 5 was maintained during the reaction time by the addition of small amounts of HCl [7].
Small samples were taken from the vessel for the deter- mination of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium using Vis spec- troscopy (Cole Parmer 1100 Spectrophotometer) combined with colorimetric reagents. In order to determine nitrates,the Cd Column method and then the colorimetric reaction were used. This colorimetric reaction is the same employed in the assay for nitrites. Ammonium was analyzed by the adapted Berthelot method.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1(A) shows that the Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst has low activity, and that the nitrate conversion strongly increases after the addition of 0.25wt% In. The In(0.25%)Pt(1%)/ Al2O3 catalyst shows a very high initial conversion rate but after ca. 15 min, it decreases reaching 67.7% of conver- sion at 100 min. For the other catalysts with In loading steeply increased up to a 1.0:1.2 wt. Pt:In ratio, the nitrate conversion decreases with the In loading increase (see Fig. 1(A) and Table 1).
Beside nitrogen, undesirable products such as nitrites and ammonia are produced. Moreover, even though N2 is the main gaseous compound formed, nitrogen oxides can also be produced [8]. Daum and Vorlop [9] suggested that nitrogen oxides are reaction intermediates.
Fig. 2(A) shows that as the reaction progresses, a small increase in nitrites concentration takes place, reaching
2.5 ppm as the maximum value for the catalyst with the
highest In content. The other catalysts show lower nitrite production. The most active catalyst for nitrate reduction [Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3] shows the lowest nitrite formation (0.5 ppm). Results for ammonia production are depicted in Fig. 3(A). In general, higher Pt:In ratios produce higher ammonia concentrations, reaching about 2223 ppm.
We calculated the initial reaction rates at nitrate conver- sions lower than 10%. At low conversions, product concen- trations are small; thus, the initial rate is an intrinsic property of the active sites towards the nitrate hydrogena- tion reaction. These results are also shown in Table 1 con- firming that the catalyst with the lowest amount of In presents the highest activity and that it steeply decreases when the In content increases. Since the non-promoted Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst presents little activity, an optimum Pt:In ratio at about 1%,0.25% is observed. Probably,higher loadings of In hinder the access of H2 molecules to the Pt crystals.
A series of Pt,In supported on SiO2 was also prepared in order to gain insight into the effect of the support. Fig. 1(B) shows that the nitrate conversion rates are considerably lower than for Pt,In/Al2O3. This fact could be due to the lower PZC value of silica, thus decreasing the rate of adsorp- tion of nitrate ions. The PZC of silica is 3.2, whereas that of alumina is 7.7, and these values do not change significantly with the incorporation of small amounts of Pt and In [10].

ported solids. However, the ammonia concentrations are an order of magnitude lower (see Fig. 3(B)). For example,for the most active Pt,In/Al2O3 catalyst, the ammonia con- centration is ca. 20 ppm at 100 min, while at the same time it is only ca. 1 ppm for SiO2 supported catalysts.
The activity of Pt,In catalysts can be explained with a redox mechanism similar to that proposed for Cu pro- moted Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3 [11]. Due to the H2 dissociation capacity of the Pd and Pt, they could work as electron donors to reduce Cu or In, respectively, which are then oxidized during the nitrate reduction.
4. Catalyst characterization
The alumina supported catalysts were characterized by XRD and TPR both before and after reaction. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of Pt,In/Al2O3 (Pt,In equal to 1%,1.2% and 1%,0.5%) and it can be seen that the fresh cat- alyst only presents the Al2O3 characteristic peaks. How- ever, the used catalyst shows a small peak at 2H = 43,which is characteristic of indium oxide. On the right-hand corner of Fig. 4, the 2H = 40 to 2H = 50 zone is magnified to better appreciate the peak.
TPR and XRD results are in agreement. Fig. 5 shows the TPR of 1.2% and 0.5% In promoted Pt(1%) catalysts,and also the monometallic catalysts for comparison. While Pt/Al2O3 displays the main reduction peak at around 100 C, In/Al2O3 reduces with a broad peak centered at 400 C. This behavior is in agreement with the one reported by Passos et al for bimetallic catalyst supported on Al2O3 [12]. In the presence of Pt, the reduction of In shifts to lower temperatures, because the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt promotes In reduction. In the case of fresh Pt(1%),In(1.2%)/Al2O3, a well-resolved peak at low tem- perature (around 120 C) with a shoulder at 200 C is shown, due to the reduction of Pt and In species, respec- tively. Table 2 shows the contribution of the different TPR peaks related to the different species. We can see that all the used samples have bigger contributions in the sec- ond peak than in the fresh samples and that the first peaks reduce their contribution in the used samples, what clearly indicate a change in the level of metal interaction, with seg- regation of In in the used catalyst.
Similar results are obtained for the fresh catalyst with Pt(1%),In(0.5%)/Al2O3. These results indicate that, in the Table 1 Activities, selectivities and initial reaction rates of Pt,In/Al2O3 as compared to other Al2O3 supported bimetallic catalysts Catalyst Residual N-ppma Nitrate conversiona Selectivity to NH 4 a Time (min) to reach 50% of conversion Reaction rateb

1023 fresh catalyst Pt and In interact on the Al2O3 surface. The same samples but after reaction show that Pt is reduced at low temperature, but a new broad peak at ca. (450500) C appears. This high temperature peak corresponds to In2O3 which does not interact with Pt, the same observation made above from XRD patterns. When Pt and In are segregated,the hydrogen dissociative adsorption on the Pt crystalls fol- lowed by spillover could also promote In species reduction [13] thus decreasing the reduction temperature. Neverthe- less, this effect is much smaller than when the metals are in intimate contact.
The chemical state of the elements and their relative pro- portions have been determined by photoelectron spectros- copy (Table 3). The In 3d5/2 BE of sample Pt:In/Al is around 445.5 eV, similar to that reported for indium in In2O3 [14]. The somewhat higher BE found in the silica supported solid could be caused by a stronger interaction between indium oxide and the support. Increases in BE were previously observed in the In/ZSM-5 system caused by the interaction between zeolite and In2O3 structures [15]. Two components were observed for Pt 4d5/2, one at lower BE (314.6314.8 eV) associated with metallic plati- num and another at higher BE (316.7316.9 eV) signifying the presence of oxidised platinum species, probably as PtO2 [16]. For silica calculations we used the more intense 4f sig- nal, which could not be used for alumina due to its overlap- ping Al2p. 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 40 42 44 46 48 50 (c) Pt,In/Al Reaction

Table 3 shows that the superficial Pt/In ratio in both SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts is lower than in the bulk,both in fresh and used solids. This observation could be explained with the findings of Alerasool et al. [17] who investigated the surface enrichment of one metal in prefer- ence to another in supported bimetallic clusters. They found that it depended on the nature of the supporting material and the mobility of the metallic precursors. For the used cat- alyst the surface Pt/In ratio does not change, but the In/Al and Pt/Al ratios strongly decrease, indicating that either bimetallic or monometallic particles increase their size.
A different type of particles could be present in the PtIn catalysts: Pt crystals, In oxides, and some type of PtIn compound. TPR results show that a close interaction exists in the fresh catalyst, which is partially lost after reaction.
Thus, XPS results could be interpreted in terms of the exis- tence of bimetallic particles enriched in In in their surface,which after reaction segregate in bigger Pt and Indium oxide crystals.
It is known that bimetallic particles may have different compositions if they form intermetallic compounds: Pt2In3, Pt3In7 and a third one that only exists at very high temper- atures [18]. These two compounds having atomic Pt/In ratios lower than one may contribute to the In surface enrichment. Since pure Pt particles display very low activ- ity, and In alone cannot reduce itself, it can be expected that bimetallic Pt,In particles be responsible for the activity for nitrates reduction [19]. Experiments are planned using EXAFS analyses, which is the appropriate tool to confirm the existence of bimetallic particles and estimate their com- position. Anyway, in the light of the XRD, TPR and XPS results, it can be inferred that the decrease in conversion rate observed for the Pt,In/Al2O3 with Pt:In equal to 1%,
0.25% is originated in the segregation of Pt and In phases
during the time-on-stream.
The results also show that the catalysts with the highest Pt:In ratio have the best activity. A higher In loading results in catalysts with lower activity, probably because Pt atoms are covered with In thus avoiding the H2 dissoci- ation. This speculation is further supported by the In sur- face enrichment observed in XPS results.
To further support the findings discussed above, dynamic CO chemisorption measurements were carried out in fresh and used Pt(1%),In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst. The fresh cata- lyst adsorbs a very low amount of CO showing an apparent dispersion of only 1%. However, after reaction, the catalyst is able to adsorb more CO (16% of dispersion). The appar- ently low dispersion of the fresh catalyst could be ascribed to some kind of electronic interaction among Pt and In in the intermetallic particles [20] and the increase of dispersion after use could be due to the previously discussed segrega- tion, in line with the XRD, TPR and XPS results.
For comparison purposes, Table 1 also summarizes the activities and selectivities of the Pt/In catalysts and those obtained for Pd/Cu, Pd/In and Pd/Co catalysts, which were studied in a previous work [21]. It was verified that out of the three metal-promoted catalysts, the one promoted by Cu presented both the highest activity to convert nitrates and the highest selectivity to N2 because it presented the highest conversion (85.4%) after 100 min. However, it should be pointed out that the Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst shows less conversion at 100 min but reaches a 50% nitrate conversion in less time than the Pd/Cu catalyst. This indi- cates that the Pt catalyst presents higher initial activity than Table 3 XPS Results for Pt,In/Al2O3 and Pt,In/SiO2 catalysts Pt,In/Al2O3 Binding energies (eV) Pt/Al In/Al Pt/Ins a Pt/Inb b Al 2s Pt 4d5/2 In 3d5/2 1%, 0.25%

1025 the Pd catalyst but it loses activity at higher times, a fact that can be related to the particle segregation observed in used catalysts.
5. Conclusions
Kinetic experiments using Pt,In supported catalysts together with XPS and TPR results suggest that the active sites consist of bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7. However, EXAFS experiments are being planned to further confirm this point.
Among the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/ Al2O3 is the most active one. At low time-on-stream, it has a very high conversion rate, even higher than that observed for the Pd,Cu catalyst. However, the conversion rate decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases, as shown in TPR and XRD characterization. Cata- lysts supported on silica have considerably lower activities,probably due to the lower PZC of the support, which would decrease the nitrate ions adsorption rate. Studies are under- way to further clarify the nature of the active sites, the reac- tion mechanism and the possibility of regenerating the highly active Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst.
