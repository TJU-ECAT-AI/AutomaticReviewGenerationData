1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does mention that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in maleic anhydride hydrogenation, which is an important intermediate for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. The formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks, and a small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies for catalyst characterization, and flow reactor studies for catalytic activity evaluation.

1.文献没有提供关于如何使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C═O键的氢化反应对精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等各种工业和研究应用的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，支持的PtNi双金属催化剂在马来酸酐氢化中表现出最高的活性，马来酸酐是化学、制药和食品工业的重要中间体。PtNi化合物的形成促使还原峰的偏移，少量的Pt进一步提高了Ni/Al2O3的活性和选择性。用于研究、优化和提高该过程选择性和效率的方法包括用于催化剂表征的X射线衍射(XRD)和H2温度程序还原(TPR)研究，以及用于催化活性评估的流动反应器研究。
