1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does mention that supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in maleic anhydride hydrogenation, which is an important intermediate for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. The formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks, and a small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies for catalyst characterization, and flow reactor studies for catalytic test. The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel, and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt to increase the rate of H2 dissociation.

1.文献没有提供具体信息，说明如何使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C═O键的氢化，对精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等工业和研究应用的贡献。但是，它确实提到，支持的PtNi双金属催化剂在马来酸酐氢化中表现出最高的活性，马来酸酐是化学、制药和食品工业的重要中间体。PtNi化合物的形成会引发还原峰的偏移，少量的Pt会进一步提高Ni/Al2O3的活性和选择性。用于研究、优化和提高该过程选择性和效率的方法包括用于催化剂表征的X射线衍射(XRD)和H2温度程序还原(TPR)研究，以及用于催化测试的流动反应器研究。该过程似乎由镍上的H2解离控制，通过添加少量的Pt来增加H2解离的速率，可以在不损失选择性的情况下进一步提高催化活性。
