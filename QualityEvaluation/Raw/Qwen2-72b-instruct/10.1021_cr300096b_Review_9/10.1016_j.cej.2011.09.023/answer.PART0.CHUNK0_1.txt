1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. However, it does mention that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts, including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities. The formation of PtNi compound provokes the shift of the reduction peaks, and a small amount of Pt further improves the activity and selectivity of Ni/Al2O3. The supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in maleic anhydride hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtNi bimetallic formation. The process appears to be controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and the catalytic activity can be further improved, without loss of selectivity, by adding a very small amount of Pt(0.3) to increase the rate of H2 dissociation.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于如何使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂催化C═O键的氢化反应,对精细化学品合成和纤维素生物质转化等各种工业和研究应用的贡献。但是,它确实提到双金属催化剂通常表现出与相应的单金属催化剂明显不同的性质,包括氢化活性的增强。PtNi化合物的形成会引发还原峰的偏移,少量的Pt会进一步提高Ni/Al2O3的活性和选择性。在马来酸酐氢化反应中,支撑的PtNi双金属催化剂表现出最高的活性,这主要归因于PtNi双金属的形成。该过程似乎由镍上的H2解离控制,通过添加非常少量的Pt(0.3),可以在不损失选择性的情况下进一步提高催化活性,以增加H2的解离速率。
