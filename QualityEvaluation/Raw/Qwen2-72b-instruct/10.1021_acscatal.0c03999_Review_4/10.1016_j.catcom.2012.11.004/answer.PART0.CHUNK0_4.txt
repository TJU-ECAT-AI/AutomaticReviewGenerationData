1.The document does not provide detailed information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that gallium oxides have been recognized as one of the most promising materials for propane dehydrogenation due to their excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which are believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere. The population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The development of new improved catalytic systems exhibiting desirable stability and activity continues to be a major challenge.

1.文档没有提供不同Ga2O3多晶型(α-, β-, γ-, 和 δ-)的结构特征、表面性质(尤其是酸性和碱性)以及Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到氧化镓由于其与传统的Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率，已被公认为是丙烷脱氢最有希望的材料之一。Ga2O3基系统在PDH中的优越性能归因于独特的结构特征，即表面配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，这些位点被认为对于CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。在不同的Ga2O3多晶型中，催化相关的(cus) Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积密切相关。开发新的改进的催化系统，表现出理想的稳定性和活性，仍然是一个主要挑战。
