1.The document does not provide detailed information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, nor does it propose mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. However, it does mention that gallium oxides have been recognized as one kind of the most promising materials due to their excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which is believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere.

1.文档没有提供详细信息，说明不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-, β-, γ-, 和 δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能，也没有提出机制来解释在反应的初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性。然而，它确实提到镓氧化物因其与传统Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率而被公认为最有前途的材料之一。Ga2O3基系统在PDH中的优越性能归因于独特的结构特征，即表面配位不饱和（cus）Ga3+位点，这被认为对CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。
