1.The document does not provide detailed information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that gallium oxides have been recognized as promising materials for propane dehydrogenation due to their excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for propane dehydrogenation has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which are believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere. The population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The development of new improved catalytic systems exhibiting desirable stability and activity continues to be a major challenge.

1.文档没有提供不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特性、表面性质和Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到镓氧化物由于其与传统的Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率，已被公认为是丙烷脱氢的有希望的材料。Ga2O3基系统在丙烷脱氢中的优越性能归因于独特的结构特性，即表面（cus）Ga3+位点的配位不饱和，这被认为是CO2气氛中烃类活化的关键。在不同的Ga2O3多晶型中，催化相关的（cus）Ga物种的数量是Ga2O3表面面积的强烈函数。开发新的改进的催化系统，表现出理想的稳定性和活性，仍然是一个主要挑战。
