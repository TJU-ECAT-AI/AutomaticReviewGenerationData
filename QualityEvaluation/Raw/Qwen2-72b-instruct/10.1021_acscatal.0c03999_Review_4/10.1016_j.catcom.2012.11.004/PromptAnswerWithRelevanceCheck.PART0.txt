How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

1.The document does not provide detailed information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that gallium oxides have been recognized as promising materials for propane dehydrogenation due to their excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for propane dehydrogenation has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which are believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere. The population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The development of new improved catalytic systems exhibiting desirable stability and activity continues to be a major challenge.

1.文档没有提供不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特性、表面性质和Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的详细信息。但是，它确实提到镓氧化物由于其与传统的Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率，已被公认为是丙烷脱氢的有希望的材料。Ga2O3基系统在丙烷脱氢中的优越性能归因于独特的结构特性，即表面（cus）Ga3+位点的配位不饱和，这被认为是CO2气氛中烃类活化的关键。在不同的Ga2O3多晶型中，催化相关的（cus）Ga物种的数量是Ga2O3表面面积的强烈函数。开发新的改进的催化系统，表现出理想的稳定性和活性，仍然是一个主要挑战。

1.文档没有提供详细信息，说明不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-, β-, γ-, 和 δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能，也没有提出机制来解释在反应的初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性。然而，它确实提到镓氧化物因其与传统Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率而被公认为最有前途的材料之一。Ga2O3基系统在PDH中的优越性能归因于独特的结构特征，即表面配位不饱和（cus）Ga3+位点，这被认为对CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。

The population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The total acidity of the four sucrose-derived samples is approximately 1-2 times higher than that of the conventional β-Ga2O3. The remarkably increased acid sites of the sucrose-derived samples can be largely attributed to a higher density of surface defects as a consequence of the decreased crystallinity and structural modification as inferred from XRD and TEM studies. The catalytic performance shows an excellent correlation with the surface acidity data. Therefore, in line with the broad literature documenting the propane dehydrogenation reaction over Ga-based materials, it appears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts.

1.文件没有提供详细信息关于不同Ga2O3多晶型(α-, β-, γ-, 和 δ-)的结构特征、表面性质(尤其是酸性和碱性)以及Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能，也没有提出解释在初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制。然而，它确实提到氧化镓由于其与传统Cr-或V-基系统相比的优异催化效率，已被公认为丙烷脱氢最有希望的材料之一。Ga2O3基系统在丙烷脱氢中的优越性能归因于独特结构特征的表面配位不饱和(Ga3+)位点，这被认为对CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。催化相关的(cus)Ga物种的数量在不同Ga2O3多晶型中是表面Ga2O3面积的强函数。四种蔗糖衍生样品的总酸度大约是传统β-Ga2O3的1-2倍。蔗糖衍生样品中显著增加的酸位点在很大程度上可归因于表面缺陷密度的增加，这是结晶度降低和从XRD和TEM研究推断出的结构修改的结果。催化性能与表面酸度数据表现出极好的相关性。因此，与广泛文献记录的Ga基材料上的丙烷脱氢反应一致，高丰度的表面Lewis酸Ga位点是实现蔗糖衍生Ga2O3催化剂高催化活性的关键因素。
