Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites. By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering (see Figure 5). (171) Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorptionregeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07. It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

3.3 MetalOrganic Frameworks
MOFs are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands. (172) Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration. MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework. This allows design of adsorbents where not only each metal atom exclusively interacts with a single adsorbate molecule but also each of these interaction sites may be regenerated without significant loss of activity. Additionally, appropriately functionalized organic ligands can also contribute in promoting the selectivity toward the desired gas molecule. MOFs offer a large parameter space to rationally design the size, shape, and functionality of pores with high adsorption and/or diffusion selectivity toward the molecule of interest. In addition to selectivity, performance and structural reversibility on regeneration are important factors in judging the performance. The presence of polar impurities such as H2O on the adsorption performance as well as stability of the adsorbent structure can also play determining roles in the successful application of MOFs for desulfurization applications. Typical pore diameters in MOFs are in the microporous regime ranging from 3 to 20 Å, (173) although more recently, MOFs with pore sizes as high as 85 Å have been synthesized for inclusion of large biological molecules. (174) Due to the highly porous nature of most MOFs, their lower conductivity (0.3 W/m·K for MOF-5 at 300 K (175)) compared to that of crystalline materials in general can be a potential concern for strong hostguest interactions. Desulfurization using MOFs has been reviewed in the past; (14, 15, 176, 177) here we try to summarize some of these topics, provide our interpretation, and identify areas for further investigation.
Hamon et al. carried out the first experimental study of H2S adsorption in MOFs; these included the small-pore (SP) MIL-53(AlIII, CrIII, FeIII) and MIL-47(VIV) (11 Å) and the large-pore (LP) MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr) (25 and 30 Å cage diameter and 4.8×5.8 and 12.5×12.5 Å pore apertures, respectively). (178) SP MILs are built from corner-sharing chains of metal oxide (MIVO6) or hydroxide (MIIIO4(OH)2) octahedra connected through terephthalate moieties (SBET  1000 m2/g) (see Figure 6). LP MILs comprise of trimers of chromium octahedra linked with trimesate (MIL-100) or terephthalate (MIL-101) (SBET > 2000 m2/g). MIL-100, MIL-101, and MIL-47 showed the type-I-shaped (no adsorption step) isotherm, indicating that these are rigid structures; MIL-53(Al,Cr,Fe) exhibited two-step adsorption isotherms, which the authors proposed to be caused by the polar H2S molecules interacting strongly with the OH groups of the inorganic chains at the pore opening, leading to closure of the pores at low loading. This hypothesis was later claimed to be verified using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and molecular simulations. (179) It should be noted here that, for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), isotherms were simulated for two different rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and the large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm. By imposing the experimental fractions of each pore type as a function of pressure, a composite isotherm was calculated for the simulated isotherms. While this strategy yields a good match with the experimental data, the study did not investigate the ability to predict the structural transformation. Measurement of excess CH4 adsorption before and after high-pressure H2S adsorption followed by vacuum desorption showed full recovery of CH4 capacity for MIL-47(V) and MIL-53(Al,Cr), partial recovery for MIL-100 and MIL-101, and complete loss of capacity for MIL-53(Fe) due to its decomposition into iron sulfide. At 30 C and 20 bar, MIL-101 showed an unprecedented H2S loading of 38.4 mmol/g; MIL-53(Al,Cr), MIL-47, and MIL-100 showed saturation loadings of 11.8, 13.1, 14.6, and 16.7 mmol/g, respectively, which are also quite high compared to those of other H2S adsorbents. However, in cases such as off-shore natural gas sweetening, where having a smaller footprint is important, volumetrically bulky porous MOFs suffer a drawback. Adsorption being an exothermic process, sharp increases in temperatures for MOFs with ultra-high capacity raise concerns about bed stability in the absence of adequate heat transfer. Attempts to compute thermal conductivities of MOFs in the presence of adsorbed gases are starting to elucidate that the thermal conductivity of MOFs decreases with increasing pore sizes. (180, 181) Figure 6 Figure 6. (a)View of the MIL-53(Cr)LP/MIL-47(V) structures along the chain (z axis), highlighting the 1D pores system with M = Cr3+ or V4+.

Vaesen et al. explored functionalization of MOFs for desulfurization application by comparing amino-functionalized titanium terephthalate MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 versus its parent MIL-125(Ti) analogue. (182) The frameworks consists of tetrahedral (4.7 Å) and octahedral (10.7 Å) cages, accessible through triangular windows of 57 Å. The cage diameters for the functionalized material are slightly smaller those of the parent material (6 and 12 Å for the tetrahedral and octahedral cages, respectively). Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were carried out using force fields that were shown to yield a decent agreement with the single-component experimental adsorption isotherms and enthalpies. The GCMC-predicted binary H2S/CH4 selectivity values (at 10 bar, 30 C, and yH2S = 0.001) for MIL-125(Ti) and MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 were reported to be 40 and 67, respectively. The H2S adsorption enthalpy for these materials (30 kJ/mol) is comparable to that for the aluminosilicate zeolite 4A (35 kJ/mol). (183) These MOF materials are thermally stable up to 300 C, but only up to 100 C in water vapor. Their performance and structural stability in the presence of both H2S and H2O require further investigation. Furthermore, the moderately high CO2/CH4 selectivity (7) allows for envisaging a one-step process for the concomitant elimination of CO2 and H2S. Obtaining separate CO2-rich and H2S-rich streams unnecessarily increases the separation costs if the end goal for H2S is high-pressure reinjection into empty wells, instead of the conventional Claus process for sulfur recovery.
Yang et al. studied H2S adsorption in MIL-68(Al) at room temperature using molecular simulations and experiments. (184) This framework consists of two kinds of channels, triangular (6.06.4 Å) and hexagonal (1617 Å), running along the c axis (see Figure 7). It was found that only some of the hydroxyls were available for interaction, as evidenced by the computed isotherm, obtained by blocking the triangular channels, matching exactly with the experimental isotherm. It can also be observed that the saturation loadings are less sensitive to the choice of force field parameters than the Henrys law region slope. This partially activated material was fully regenerable for five consecutive cycles with a pure-component H2S capacity of 12 mmol/g at 30 C and 12 bar and an adsorption enthalpy of 21 kJ/mol. Even if the material can be fully activated, the 25% additional saturation capacity, that is predicted from simulations, may or may not be accessible; the difference in the adsorbed amounts of CH4 and CO2 for the material activated at 260 or 330 C was negligible. Although MIL-68(Al) is a polymorph of MIL-53(Al) (described above), unlike the latter, the former does not seem to exhibit framework flexibility, as evidenced by its type-I adsorption isotherm. This brings to light the importance of MOF framework topology in addition to the choice of the metallic cluster and the organic ligands, further iterating the importance of powerful screening of adsorbents using existing and new computational techniques that capture these subtle differences.

Cu-BTC (or HKUST-1 or MOF-199) comprises of an intersecting three-dimensional system of large square-shaped pores (9 × 9 Å) and small tetrahedral pockets (5 Å) formed with copper as the inorganic metal and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC), also known as trimesic acid, as the organic linker (see Figure 8) with a reasonable degree of thermal stability (up to 240 C). (185) In the past few years, several research groups have investigated various aspects of H2S adsorption in this material. (186-192) Petit et al. first studied HKUST-1 and its composites with graphite oxide under ambient conditions using 1000 ppm H2S in moist air. (186) The authors commented that bed pre-humidification does not prevent the adsorption of H2S (2.7 mmol/g); on the contrary, it favors its retention via dissolution in the water film. Additional H2S measurements in absence of moisture will help better understand the role of H2O. The XRD pattern revealed that exposure to H2S results in a collapse of the MOF structure. From the decrease in pH on H2S adsorption and from Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, it was concluded that the BTC ligands were released (no more coordinated to copper) to their acidic form.

Watanabe and Sholl investigated chemisorption of several molecules, including H2S and H2O, in Cu-BTC using plane wave periodic DFT. (187) H2O and H2S showed similar binding energies of 51 and 47 kJ/mol, respectively. Single-component GCMC adsorption simulations at room temperature, computed by restricting the chemisorbed molecules in the geometries obtained from prior DFT calculations, showed that the onset pressure for H2O adsorption is nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for H2S. The influence of physisorbed molecules on the adsorption isotherm was not considered in this study. H2S models in the literature, trained to reproduce the bulk liquid densities and vapor pressures, significantly over-estimate the gas-phase dipole moment of H2S. Gutirrez-Sevillano et al. developed new H2S models to test whether a model with an accurate gas-phase dipole moment could predict a strong interaction of H2S with Cu-BTC, in line with the experimental observation. (188) The simulations used generic force fields for the MOF structure that have been shown to perform reasonably well for some of the other adsorption studies in MOFs. (184) Additionally, their hybrid DFT calculations showed that indeed H2O has a higher affinity for the copper sites (extra 3.3 kJ/mol) compared to H2S. Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) studies of the molecules adsorbed on the model cluster showed H2O to be closer to the copper center compared to H2S by about 2.6 Å. Another hybrid DFT study, with a damped 1/r6 term to account for London dispersion, showed that the interaction energies for H2O and H2S adsorption on Cu-BTC are 60.9 and 52.2 kJ/mol, respectively, reiterating the dominance of H2O. (189) Different theoretical treatments are in agreement that the interaction of Cu-BTC with H2S is weaker than that with H2O, thus failing to explain the experimental observation that H2S converts Cu in Cu-BTC to black CuS in the presence of moisture. (186) An important point to note here is that the theoretical studies only considered the hostguest interaction; however, H2S reacts chemically with copper to form CuS, and the thermodynamics of product formation have not been attempted in any of the theoretical studies reported so far.
Li et al. experimentally investigated the same system by activating the material before carrying out H2S adsorption. (190) They found that the breakthrough capacity increased by 38% on activation at 180 C compared to the unactivated sample and decreased by 10% if the sample was activated further at 200 C. The breakthrough capacity also increased by 40% when the adsorption temperature was raised from 30 to 80 C. Both of these observations suggest that there is a competitive adsorption between H2O and H2S, and lowering the adsorbed quantity of moisture, either with an increased activation temperature or with an increased adsorption temperature, increases the H2S capacity. Contrary to this inference, Peterson et al. observed no change in H2S adsorption capacity under dry (0% relative humidity) and wet (80% relative humidity) conditions. (191) In spite of a lot of research effort to understand the role of moisture in desulfurization using Cu-BTC, this problem remains unresolved.
Eddaoudi et al. synthesized a series of 16 isoretucular (having the same network topology) MOFs (IRMOF-n, n = 116) based on a skeleton of Zn-based MOF-5, wherein the pore functionality and size were varied without changing the original cubic topology. (173) Theoretical investigation of H2S was performed in IRMOF-1 (or MOF-5) having 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate organic linkers; the heat of adsorption was 15 kJ/mol, much lower than that for Cu-BTC (30 kJ/mol) due to wider (11.2 Å) pores of IRMOF-1 compared to confined (5 Å) tetrahedral-shaped pockets in Cu-BTC. IRMOF-1 also results in 6 kJ/mol weaker binding than H2O, suggesting the difficulty in using this material for H2S adsorption from moist natural gas. (188) Wang et al. studied IRMOF-3 (free pore diameter of 9.6 Å) having 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate ligands and showed that the breakthrough capacity increased by 46% on activation at 150 C compared to that of the unactivated sample and decreased by 93% if the sample was activated further at 200 C. (193) The breakthrough capacity decreased to 19% when the adsorption temperature was increased from 30 to 60 C. It would be interesting to study comparative H2S adsorption in the two MOFs (IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-3) to understand the role of the NH2 group in IRMOF-3 for selective binding with acid gases.Allan et al. studied desulfurization using Ni-CPO-27 and Zn-CPO-27, where Ni/Zn cations are linked by 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid organic linkers, forming a honeycomb lattice with channels of 11 Å pore diameter. (194) In the hydrated state, each metal is coordinated by one H2O molecule, but upon activation at 150 C under vacuum, H2O is removed, leaving the metal in square pyramidal geometry with an open metal site, resulting in SBET = 1193 and 379 m2/g, respectively. H2S exposure did not degrade the crystalline structure of Ni-CPO-27 but amorphized Zn-CPO-27. (194, 195) Ni-CPO-27 showed a steep rise in loading up to 6.4 mmol/g (corresponding to each metal center interacting with one gas molecule, see Figure 9), indicating a sharp chemisorption regime followed by a slower uptake likely due to physisorption up to 12 mmol/g at atmospheric pressure. Adsorbents with such high loadings at low pressures are rare, and it may be useful in effectively removing large amounts of H2S from gas streams with a low H2S partial pressure. However, the material cannot be fully regenerated at outgassing temperature of 150 C and a vacuum of 0.1 Pa, (194) but it could be nearly completely regenerated at 200 C. (195) The authors hint at some damage to the framework by this high-temperature regeneration; additional microscopy and diffraction data for the regenerated samples should help understand the degree of damage and whether the structural damage increases with the number of regeneration cycles. The heat of adsorption is nearly constant (5658 kJ/mol) up to a loading of 0.7 H2S molecule per atom of Ni, assuming all Ni atoms are activated. The authors comment that, beyond this loading, the drop in interaction strength can be justified with typical weak physisorption with no specific interaction between the host/guest species. However, it is unclear how the physisorption regime can start without reaching a loading of 1 H2S molecule per Ni atom, and this could possibly indicate incomplete activation of the MOF (70% activated). Compared to other MOFs investigated so far for H2S adsorption, Ni-CPO-27 shows the highest uptake and high enthalpy of adsorption (indicative of possibly higher selectivity over methane) with structural stability. However, the experimental heat of adsorption of H2O for this material is <100 kJ/mol, which may or may not make this material an ideal adsorbent for natural gas in the presence of moisture. Nonetheless, the material appears to be very promising and should be investigated for H2S adsorption in the presence of H2O.Figure 9 Figure 9.

Copyright 2013 American Chemical Society.Using GCMC simulations with generic force fields that have not been thoroughly validated for any particular property, Peng and Cao carried out a screening of some select porous carbons, zeolites, and MOFs for a feed containing 0.2% H2S, 29.8% CO2, and 70% CH4 at 50 bar and 30 C. (196) Among the MOFs, indium-based rho-zMOF (a zeolite-like MOF with the topology of rho-zeolite) and socMOF showed high selectivity (175 and 100, respectively) and capacity (2.6 and 1.8 mmol/g, respectively). The capacity for rho-zMOF at temperatures of 60 C and higher is reported to be 0.5 mmol/g, suggesting a working capacity of about 2 mmol/g with very low temperatures of regeneration. While this is an important discovery, there is a considerable uncertainty in the force-field parameters for such highly charged systems, and experiments will help to confirm the validity of the predictions as regards such high selectivity and capacity as well as stability of MOF in the presence of impurities such as moisture.Very recently, Belmabkhout et al. investigated In3+-, Fe3+-, Ga3+-, and Al3+-based socMOFs as adsorbents and thin-film membranes for the production of high-quality hydrocarbons (CH4, C3H8 and n-C4H10, and olefins) from H2S-containing gas streams. Only Ga3+- and Al3+-based socMOFs could preserve the crystal structure on exposure to H2S. (197) The authors measured pure-component adsorption isotherms for H2S, CO2, and CH4 in Ga3+-socMOF at 25 C and found that, unlike CH4 and CO2, H2S showed a steep adsorption. The authors also carried out breakthrough measurements for a ternary mixture containing 5% H2S, 5% CO2, and 90% CH4 for six adsorptiondesorption cycles with a combination of temperature and vacuum swing regeneration. Optimal regeneration was achieved at 160 C under a helium flow for 8 h with complete recyclability of the adsorbent. Since the mass of adsorbent used for the experiment is unclear (between 0.1 and 0.4 g), the reported H2S breakthrough time of 40 min translates to a breakthrough capacity between 2 and 8 mmol/g. CH4 and CO2 breakthrough occurred at nearly 0 and 5 min, respectively, suggesting very high H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities. The narrow window aperture (4.5 Å) to reach the cages of the of Ga3+-socMOF may have an influence on the breakthrough capacity and selectivity. Al3+-socMOF was shown to be stable up to temperatures as high as 300 C and relative humidity as high as 95%, and even soaking in liquid water for 2 weeks did not affect the XRD pattern. However, the H2O stability of the Ga3+-socMOF was not reported. These materials show promise for regenerative sour gas sweetening using MOFs.Stability of adsorbent in the corrosive environment of acid gases in the presence/absence of moisture is arguably the most important test that the adsorbent must meet in order to qualify as a potential candidate for sweetening applications. The not-so-strong coordination bond between the metal and the organic ligand in a MOF structure make it very susceptible to hydrolysis and poor stability. Burtch et al. have recently published a very detailed paper in Chemical Reviews on the hydrothermal stability of MOFs. (198) Apart from a few studies on acid gas stability of certain MOFs, (199) this area is not very mature for a comprehensive review. Future efforts in this direction will not only help advance the development of adsorbents for commercial purposes but also enhance the fundamental understanding of MOF stability.Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-class of MOFs, composed of transition metal ions that replace the silicon/aluminum atoms in a zeolite topology and organic linkers in place of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite lattice, are a relatively new type of materials that benefit from the structural variety of MOFs and stability of zeolites. (200, 201) ZIF-8, with a BET surface area of 1630 m2/g, a high thermal stability (up to 550 C), and remarkable chemical resistance to boiling alkaline water and organic solvents, (201) is one of the very extensively studied ZIF materials in the literature. Recently, Ethiraj et al. investigated the stability of HKUST-1 and ZIF-8 MOFs in an H2S environment using various techniques, including XRD, and observed a significantly higher stability of ZIF-8 over HKUST-1. (192) Other microporous materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (202) and porous aromatic frameworks, (203) that are low-density, high-surface-area materials but do not contain any selective metallic sites, can be explored for bulk H2S removal.As noted earlier, feed streams with varying overall pressure as well as concentration of H2S are likely to require very different sweetening procedures. While low-concentration (101000 ppm) breakthrough measurements provide important data for applications such as Claus tail gas cleanup, data at higher H2S partial pressures are also important for applications involving ultra-sour gas streams. A major difficulty in drawing a fair comparison between different MOFs in the literature for H2S adsorption arises due to the unavailability of complete adsorption data over a wide range of partial pressures, from a few ppm at atmospheric pressure to 100% H2S at several atmospheres in the presence/absence of moisture, different definitions of breakthrough capacity, etc. Future studies should account for factors such as moisture, regeneration for several cycles, and XRD measurements before and after each (or at least, after every few) regeneration.
3.4 Zeolites
For several decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry for cracking, isomerization, and alkylation applications. These materials are also widely used for water purification and softening in the detergent industry. Structurally, zeolites are crystalline porous aluminosilicates consisting of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra. Their pores are defined by their crystal structure and have precise sizes and shapes, allowing them excellent sieving properties at a molecular level. As of today, the database of the International Zeolite AssociationStructure Commission identifies 232 unique zeolite frameworks, and each framework is represented by a three-letter code. (204) The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classifies nanoporous materials into three classes: microporous (<2 nm), mesoporous (250 nm), and macroporous (>50 nm). Zeolites are microporous in nature, and depending on the particular framework structure, the maximum diameter of a sphere that can diffuse through the zeolite framework can range from 1 to 8 Å. The maximum diameter of a sphere that can be included in the zeolite structures can range from 3 to 16 Å.
3.4.1 All-Silica Zeolites
All-silica zeolites have a very low polarity due to negligible amounts of polar cations and silanol defects, imparting a highly hydrophobic character to this class of zeolites. (206) Maghsoudi et al. first investigated pure-component adsorption of H2S and CH4 in an all-silica zeolite of the chabazite (CHA) framework. (207) This material demonstrated a high H2S capacity of 4 mmol/g at 25 C and 2 bar, suggesting that all-silica zeolites maybe promising materials for bulk H2S removal. Shah et al. carried out Monte Carlo simulations of H2S and CH4, both pure-component and mixture, over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and compositions in seven different all-silica zeolites. (208) The authors showed quantitative agreement between predictive molecular simulations without any fitting parameters and the experimental data reported by Maghsoudi et al., thus validating the force fields for H2S, (209) CH4, (210) and the zeolite. (211) Shat et al. also assessed the application of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) to pure-component data in order to predict mixture data and found differences as high as 60% in case of some zeolites. In order to probe whether the presence of H2S induces H2O coadsorption and reduces the hydrophobic character of all-silica zeolites, binary H2S/H2O mixture adsorption in MFI was also studied. The simulations showed preferential adsorption of H2S over H2O with a selectivity of about 18, suggesting that these zeolites can be promising materials for sour gas sweetening. In a subsequent study, Shat et al. carried out a large-scale computational screening of the adsorption of binary H2S/CH4 and H2S/C2H6 mixtures in the all-silica forms of 386 zeolitic frameworks (see Figure 10). (205) The authors also investigated the adsorption of four- and five-component mixtures at the conditions representing sour gas fields for 16 promising all-silica zeolites selected from binary adsorption selectivities and capacities. It was found that, depending on the fractions of CH4, C2H6, and CO2, different sorbents allow for optimal H2S removal and hydrocarbon recovery.

Liu et al. carried out a multi-scale modeling study for combined material screening and process optimization to reduce the overall process cost with atomistic and mesoscopic scales for the selection of zeolites and the macroscopic scale for the selection of optimal conditions for pressure swing adsorption. (212) Several high-performing zeolites were identified, and zeolite ABW ranks as one of the top materials for the removal of both H2S and CO2 (acid gases) from natural gas. There is a considerable degree of overlap between the zeolites identified from the two screening studies in the literature for high H2S/CH4 selectivities. (205, 212) The best-performing zeolites will likely always be from this pool of structures identified with high selectivity over methane; however, the optimal adsorbent will depend on the feed conditions (wet/dry, lean/rich in light hydrocarbons, CO2/H2S proportions).
Of all the top-performing structures presented in Figure 10, CAS, DOH, ITE, ITH, ITW, MEL, MEP, MFI, MTN, RRO, RWR, and SFF frameworks have been synthesized in their all-silica form, IWV with a Si/Al ratio of 29, SEW with a Si/B ratio of 13, and ABW, BIK, EDI, EPI, GIS, JBW, LTJ, LTL, MER, MON, MOZ, PAU, PHI, and UFI with a low to moderate Si/Al ratio. (205) Although DOH, MEP, and MTN show a high selectivity, it is unlikely that the pores in these structures with only six-membered ring openings will allow accessibility to the selective sites. Development of experimental syntheses for the all-silica defect-free forms of these top-performing zeolite topologies can further the development of these hydrophobic adsorbents for the bulk acid gas removal from ultra-sour gas fields.
3.4.2 Aluminosilicate Zeolites
Aluminosilicate zeolites are crystalline microporous frameworks, based on a three-dimensional network of silica and alumina, that can accommodate a variety of cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc. In addition to the precise sizes and shapes of pores in all-silica zeolites that allow them excellent sieving properties at a molecular level, the cations in aluminosilicate zeolites may allow the possibility of strong selective interactions with the desired polar gas molecules. There is a significant amount of literature exploring the Claus reaction between H2S and SO2 to produce elemental sulfur using cation-exchanged zeolites. (213, 214) While this is a very important aspect of sour gas sweetening, it has been reviewed in the past, (20) and we will focus here on the interaction of these zeolites with H2S in the absence of oxygen.
Ozekmekci et al. have presented a short review on H2S removal using zeolites. (215) We try to expand on this subject here. Identifying the adsorption mechanism of H2S in cation-exchanged zeolites has been a challenge, whether it is a physisorption, chemisorption by coordination to the cations, or a chemical reaction forming H2O using either framework oxygen or gas-phase oxygen impurities or possibly even metal oxides of the extra-framework cations. In an attempt to understand the adsorption mechanism, several zeolitic systems based on faujasite (FAU; NaX, NaY, HY), LTA (NaA, CaNaA, ZnNaA, MnNaA, CoNaA, NiNaA, CuNaA), and MFI (H-ZSM-5, Na-ZSM-5) were probed using IR, (216-221) UV/vis, (219) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. (222) On aluminum-rich FAU up to Si/Al ratios of about 2.5 (NaX zeolites), the first H2S molecules are adsorbed dissociatively, producing OH groups (3650 cm1) similar to those of hydrogen FAU; however, NaY-type zeolites with Si/Al > 2.5 adsorb the H2S molecules practically without dissociation. (218) Similar conclusions were also reported by Lechert and Henning using the NMR technique. (222) The first molecules adsorbed on NaX dissociated completely with formation of S2 and 2OH, but at higher coverages, dissociation into HS and H+ (see Figure 11) as well as physical adsorption occurs. (219) Four times higher H2S adsorption capacities for X-type zeolites than for Y-type zeolites were observed; moreover, the uptake changed in the following sequence: K-FAU > Na-FAU > Li-FAU, suggesting that H2S adsorption improves with FAU basicity. (223) Garcia and Lercher studied adsorption of H2S in ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al = 35.5) and observed molecular adsorption on both Na- and H-ZSM-5 zeolite surfaces. (221) In conclusion, lower Si/Al ratios promote dissociative adsorption of H2S on cation-exchanged zeolites. Recently, Sigot et al. attempted to investigate the retention mechanism of H2S on NaX zeolites with Si/Al ratio of 1.4. (224) The authors observed poor thermal desorption at 350 C, indicating no physisorption and the formation of stable sulfur polymers which further compromised thermal regeneration.
Figure 11 Figure 11. Schematic of dissociative H2S adsorption on an aluminosilicate zeolite.
The SH vibration band of H2S adsorbed on NaA showed a large frequency shift; however, in the case of CaNaA, over a wide range of coverage, the characteristic frequency of the SH band remained constant at 2540 cm1. (217) Thus, the authors concluded that no significant sorbatesorbate interactions occur and that all H2S molecules occupy equivalent sites in the case of CaNaA. No bands corresponding to adsorbed species were observed for NiNaA and CuNaA, and CoNaA adsorbed non-dissociatively, while ZnNaA and MnNaA demonstrated both dissociative and non-dissociative adsorption. (220) In agreement with previous studies of H2S adsorption on various zeolites, (216-218) water formation was observed on adsorption of H2S onto MnNaA, ZnNaA, and CoNaA. It is not very clear, however, whether H2O is formed using either framework oxygen or oxygen impurities in the gas feed. It is unclear if metal oxide clusters of the exchanged cations are present in the system and whether these form a source of oxygen for water formation. Very recently, Wynnyk and co-workers carried out precise and detailed measurements up to high pressures for adsorption of sour gas species (CO2, COS, CH4, and H2S) on zeolite 4A (LTA) with Si/Al ratios between 1.14 and 1.15 and activated under ultra-high vacuum (1010 bar) up to 400 C. (183) The adsorption isotherms of these compounds were found to be quite different, with saturation loadings extrapolated from the fitted adsorption isotherm for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS being 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively. The low saturation capacity of COS was not expected; computational calculations for HOMO bond orientation indicated that COS should be excluded from zeolite 4A, despite the experimental results. The reason for decreasing saturation loadings for CO2 with decreasing temperatures (0, 25, and 50 C) was not explained by the authors. The authors also calculated the enthalpy of adsorption using isotherms at different temperatures; at low loadings, CH4 and COS yield similar values of 20 kJ/mol, while CO2 and H2S interact more strongly, with values of 35 kJ/mol (near saturation loading). These enthalpies of adsorption seem too small to suggest a chemisorption behavior; however, it should be noted that these interactions can be sensitive to even trace amounts of H2O that may accompany the feed gas.
H2S adsorption on cluster models of metal-exchanged ZSM-12 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn atoms) was investigated using DFT calculations, and the reported enthalpies of adsorption were 77, 77, 90, 58, and 76 kJ/mol, respectively. (225) This suggests that Ni binds most strongly to H2S, while the binding with Cu is the weakest. One can see that the trends for different metals are not the same as reported for cation-exchanged LTA zeolites described above. (220) A key issue here is that we are not certain of the fraction of the cations in the ion-exchanged sites versus that in the metal oxide form. Several other factors, such as difference in the confinement of LTA and MTW zeolites for the same metallic species, presence of impurities in experimental measurements, or inadequate level of theory to describe the system using DFT, can also contribute to the different trends in the two zeolite types. In the absence of more data, it is hard to draw concrete conclusions about the affinity of various transition metal cations toward H2S.
SAPO-43, a small-pore silicoaluminophosphate, is a microporous sorbent with appropriate dimensions for sour gas sieving; however, its low thermal stability up to about 300 C prevents its utilization for adsorptive separations. Elemental analysis and CO2 heats of adsorption point to the presence of amine-like compounds entrapped in the surface of SAPO-43, which are believed to keep the framework from collapsing. (226) Hernndez-Maldonado et al. demonstrated the use of partially calcined SAPO-43 to separate CO2, H2S, and H2O from natural gas. (226) Regeneration with pure helium at 180 C was sufficient to remove almost all of the adsorbed water, but only 40% of the adsorption capacity was restored for H2S. The authors suggest that regeneration using chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may help in entirely removing H2S without the need to thermally regenerate the adsorbent.
Crespo et al. compared the H2S breakthrough capacities among Cu(I)Y, Cu(II)Y, CuCl/MCM-41, CuCl/SBA-15, and AgY. (227) It was found from both ab initio molecular orbital calculations and the experimental temperature dependence of adsorption isotherms that the energy of adsorption decreased in the following order: Cu(I)Y > AgY > Cu(II)Y. The chemical composition of AgY zeolites, Ag63Al57Si135O384, clearly shows that the Ag/Al ratio is greater than unity; this suggests thats some of the cations are located at sites other than the cation-exchange sites. Structural characterization of cation-exchanged zeolites (228) may help in better understanding some of the anomalies in trends in affinity of H2S toward various cations. Nearly 70% regeneration of Cu(I)Y zeolite was achieved by heating at 450 C in a helium environment, and 100% regeneration could be accomplished by reacting with air at 350 C; this is another indication of cations in their oxide form. With a high H2S capacity at concentrations as low as 100 ppm, high selectivity over CH4, and being fully regenerable at a moderate temperature (350 C), Cu(I)Y, CuCl/SBA-15, and CuCl/MCM-41 materials hold some promise for natural gas desulfurization.
In addition to the H2S impurity, most natural gas fields also contain other impurities such as CO2, CO, and H2O, and these polar molecules may have a tendency to compete with, and sometime even supersede, H2S adsorption. Kumar et al. carried out a detailed investigation of such mixture systems for Na-, Ag-, and Cu-exchanged FAU at high and low Si/Al ratios (see Figure 12). (229) The authors report a nearly complete loss in H2S adsorption capacity for NaX zeolite in the presence of either CO2, CO, or H2O, while CuX and CuY showed similar losses in selectivity in the presence of CO. AgX and AgY zeolites maintained H2S capacities of about 3040 mg/g at 10 ppm H2S, even in the presence of all three impurities. The authors could also explain the observed experimental trends using DFT calculations; comparisons of the structures and energetics between the cluster and periodic calculations led to the conclusion that the confinement effect from the complete zeolitic framework is insignificant for the adsorbates studied. Further DFT calculations showed that, while the presence of the zeolite does not change radically the trend in the adsorption energies for alkali metal cations, in the case of transition metal cations it enhances the CO adsorption markedly relative to all other adsorbates. (230) The authors also investigated other cation-exchanged zeolites such as Zn(II)Y, Ni(II)Y, and Ga(III)Y and found that they are all subject to strong adsorption of H2O. (231) It should be noted here that strict ion exchange (without formation of metal oxides) has not been demonstrated for these cations.

In addition to the competitive adsorption in the presence of impurities, Blow and co-workers reported on reactive adsorption of H2S and CO2 on cation-exchanged LTA and FAU zeolites. (232-234) Due to strongly preferred sorption of H2O on these zeolites (H2O  H2S  CO2  COS), the equilibrium of the reaction H2S + CO2  COS + H2O is shifted to the right. As a result, one sulfur-containing species (H2S) is transformed to another (COS), with nearly zero enrichment of sulfur on the molecular sieve. The authors have extensively studied different variations of the adsorbent such as type of zeolite, Si/Al ratio, choice of cation for exchange, degree of ion exchange (percentage of Na+ exchanged), and presorption of NH3. At room temperature, H2S conversion on LTA can be as high as 50% for a Si/Al ratio of 1, and drops to nearly zero for a Si/Al ratio of 3. (232) At higher degrees of ion exchange, there is a considerable kinetic barrier, and one can observe H2S conversions anywhere between 20 and 75%, depending on the reaction time. (232, 233) Thus, in the absence of any known method to suppress this reaction, the authors suggest short-time techniques such as PSA/VSA. (234) This study suggests that future investigations of H2S breakthrough behavior in cationic zeolites should also monitor COS breakthrough.
3.4.3 Titanosilicates
In 1989, several synthetic titanosilicates were introduced as oxides or molecular sieves that have not only tetrahedrally coordinated sites that are characteristic of zeolites such as aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates but also octahedrally coordinated framework sites. (235) These materials possess moderately high surface areas (SBET  200 m2/g), and if active metals are well-dispersed on these supports, high metal utilization for reactive adsorption can be attained. Rezaei et al. have recently investigated low-temperature reactive H2S removal using copper-exchanged Engelhard titanosilicates (ETS-2, ETS-4, ETS-10). (236) While ETS-4 and ETS-10 are microporous, ETS-2 is most probably just a layered titanate and is too dense to be considered a molecular sieve. (235) Cu-ETS-2, Cu-ETS-4, and Cu-ETS-10 show H2S breakthrough capacities of 1.4, 0.32, and 1.3 mmol/g and copper utilization of 71, 44, and 98%, respectively. The high and low copper utilization in ETS-10 and ETS-4 has been attributed to their large and small pores, respectively, leading to pore blockage by adsorbed H2S in case of ETS-4. Since ETS-10 allows near complete utilization of copper sites at 8.4 wt% copper loading, higher loadings should be investigated to possibly improve breakthrough capacities. In a follow-up work, the authors investigated the effect of exchange metals such as Ag, Ca, Cu and Zn on ETS-2 and compared to a fully developed commercial H2S adsorbent (R3-11G, 36 wt% CuO, BASF). (237) The results indicated H2S uptake capacities in the following order: Cu-ETS-2 > Ag-ETS-2 > Zn-ETS-2  R3-11G > Ca-ETS-2  Na-ETS-2. In a recent study, Roller et al. studied Cu-ETS-2, Ce-ETS-2, and Cu-Ce-ETS-2 over a wide range of temperatures and under hydrogen-rich and water-rich atmospheres and found that, contrary to Ce-modified sorbents in the literature, (153) Ce-based ETS-2 showed a very low H2S breakthrough capacity. (238)
3.5 Carbon-Based Adsorbents
3.5.1 Activated Carbons
Activated carbon (AC) with surface areas easily in excess of 1000 m2/g due to a high degree of microporosity is a well-known material for adsorption and catalysis. It is most commonly manufactured by carbonizing easily available carbon sources such as coconut shell, wood, coal, etc. at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere. The resultant coke has pores too small for use as an adsorbent, and usually steam activation is carried out to enlarge the pore structure, making it accessible for adsorption. Several studies have been reported in the literature on the use of ACs for H2S adsorption as well as Claus reaction between H2S and O2 to form elemental sulfur. Unlike crystalline materials such as MOFs and zeolites, ACs are amorphous and hence characterized using N2 adsorption, pH measurements, thermal analysis, ion chromatography, elemental analysis, and FTIR techniques. It is nearly impossible to rationalize the large amounts of data in this field with various carbon sources, activation conditions, pH of adsorption, and presence of unidentifiable impurities in the ACs. An attempt is made to highlight some of the studies that show high adsorption of H2S, but the reasons for most of these are not well-understood.Turk et al. have demonstrated the injection of basic chemicals such as ammonia and caustic solutions to enhance H2S adsorption. (239, 240) There are numerous investigations from the Bandosz group on removal of H2S using ACs that differ in their surface areas, pore volumes, and surface acidities. (241-246) The heat of H2S adsorption on a variety of ACs, differing in surface chemistry, pH, or the presence of specific oxygenated groups, was shown to be between 39 and 47 kJ/mol, about 2 times that obtained for a nonporous surface. (242) Adib et al. tried to increase the basicity of AC by impregnating it with urea; however, the H2S conversion decreased by about 10% from 298 to 272 mg/g for the impregnated samples compared to the initial sample, possibly due to an 18% decrease in surface area on urea impregnation. (244) Tian et al. chemically modified the surface of AC using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), thus imparting a basic character to the sorbent with the goal of enhancing interaction with acidic H2S. (247) The authors observed poor breakthrough capacities of <1 mg/g at 1600 ppm, maybe due to blockage of pores because of the bulky APTES impregnation. At 8200 ppm the equilibrium adsorption capacity of H2S is 18.13, 8.88, and 6.03 mg/g for APTES-AC, Na2CO3-AC, and AC, respectively. Moisture and temperature were found to have adverse effects on H2S removal, while oxygen favored H2S removal. The negative role of humidity in this study is contradictory to previous studies of H2S adsorption on AC, (241) while the positive effect of oxygen has been explained by the authors to be due to the catalytic role of oxygen during oxidation.Regeneration of ACs using cold and hot water washing and using heating at 300 C in air atmosphere showed that, after the first adsorption run, the capacity of carbon for hydrogen sulfide adsorption significantly decreased (around 60%) due to irreversible adsorption in the most active adsorption cites located in small pores; subsequent runs revealed a more or less constant capacity. (248, 249) Boudou et al. could regenerate the H2S-adsorbed AC sorbents by heating for 10 min in flowing N2 at 500 C. (250) Although inert atmosphere can be maintained at laboratory scales, the possibility of self-ignition at such high temperatures of regeneration cannot be eliminated. Aging of ACs has shown that the sorbents having significant capacity after the first adsorption run are practically unwashable with water due to the deposition of bulky sulfur polymers that are resistant to oxidation. (251)
3.5.2 Structured Carbons
Structured nanoporous carbon materials may be broadly classified into two main kinds: graphene-based materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Graphene is an allotrope of carbon that consists of a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of single atomic layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Graphene-based materials may be further classified as pristine graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). (252) CNTs are cylindrical nanostructures that may be imagined as seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets with channel diameters as small as 0.4 nm, (253) 1.4 nm in several studies, (254) and can be as high as 50 nm. (252) The CNTs can be open or closed with half-fullerene caps at either ends of the cylindrical structure. These single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) are usually observed as closely packed bundles on a honeycomb lattice with typically 100 nanotubes (of 1.4 nm diameter) forming bundles of <20 nm diameter. (255) The adsorption sites in SWCNT bundles maybe classified into three kinds: inside each tube, interstitial channels between the tubes, and outer surface peripheral to the bundle. The surface area for these materials may range from over 2500 m2/g for a SWCNT to as low as 800 m2/g for bundles of infinite diameter. (255) SWCNTs of varying channel diameters can also arrange in the form of several concentric cylinders to form multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).Several groups have theoretically investigated the role of defects in the adsorption of H2S on the graphene surface, mainly for sensor applications. (256-259) Depending on the position of binding, adsorption energies of H2S on pristine graphene were found to be between 10 and 16 kJ/mol, but having a defect site with the sulfur atom of H2S pointing toward the defect resulted in a much stronger binding (88 kJ/mol). (256) In another study, three different graphene structures (pristine, with divacancy, and with the inclusion of nitrogen in graphene) were investigated, and the binding energies were found to be 1.6, 1.3, and 2.5 kJ/mol, respectively. (257) Borisova et al. investigated the effect of vacancy in graphene and found that H2S adsorbed by forming weak SC covalent bonds with the atoms surrounding the single vacancy. (258) In addition to the single vacancy and divacancies in graphene described above, there can be several other defect types; one such defect is the StoneWales (SW) defect that has four hexagons fused into two alternating pentagons and heptagons. Hegde et al. studied H2S binding to the carbon site of pristine graphene, SW defect site, and BN sites of BN-doped graphene through first-principles DFT with van der Waals (vdW) interactions. (259) While the adsorption of H2S is weak at both C and BN sites, with a binding energy of 15 kJ/mol, it is significantly stronger at the SW defect site with a binding energy of 26 kJ/mol. In the relaxed geometries, the sulfur atom of H2S points toward graphene (at a distance 3.14 Å) at C and BN sites, while the molecules H atoms point toward graphene (at a distance 2.84 Å) at the SW defect site. There seem to be significant differences in the various predictions for H2S adsorption on graphene; these differences may be due to different levels of theories employed for the independent studies. A consistent treatment of all defect types will be important in order to understand, quantitatively, the role of graphene defects in H2S adsorption.There are several studies employing DFT for adsorption of H2S on metal-doped graphene. (256, 260-265) Strong adsorption was found due to a large binding energy (615 kJ/mol for 1 H2S/Pt system and 75 kJ/mol of H2S for the 7 H2S/Pt system) and short PtH2S bond length compared to those of the H2S/graphene system. (260) Zhang et al. reported binding energies of 16, 64, 174, and 185 kJ/mol for pristine, Ca-, Co-, and Fe-doped graphene, respectively. (256) Sharma and Verma calculated binding energies of 33, 42, 123, and 98 kJ/mol for pristine, B-, Al-, and Ga-doped graphene, respectively. (261) Pang et al. reported binding energies of 15, 81, 102, and 112 kJ/mol for pristine, Cr-, Cu-, and W-doped graphene, respectively. (265) These highly energetic interactions of H2S with metal-doped graphene are mainly of interest for sensor applications; however, they may have potential usefulness in adsorbents for ultra-deep sulfur removal of natural gas as the final polishing step for direct-methane fuel cells. (170) The effect of the presence of S atom on graphene on the adsorption of H2S was investigated using DFT. (266) Two types of systems were investigated: S-functionalized graphene, where an S atom was added on pristine graphene, and S-doped graphene, where an S atom was added to the single-vacancy defect of graphene. Pristine graphene showed adsorption energies of 34 kJ/mol, while S-functionalized graphene showed energies as high as 170 kJ/mol due to covalent bond formation between S and H2S for configurations with H atoms pointing away from the graphene plane. Both physisorption and chemisorption were observed, depending upon CS bond distances in the H2S/S-doped graphene complex before optimization.Molecular simulations for adsorption on structured carbons in the literature give very inconsistent answers and use idealized structures that may not be experimentally realizable. (267-270) Neglect of electrostatic interactions for the adsorbent in studies involving polar sorbate molecules may result in incorrect predictions of sorbatesorbent interactions. The potential of GO has not yet been extensively explored by molecular modeling, mainly due to the lack of an atomistic GO model for theoretical calculations. (271) Huang et al. have reported the controllable generation of atomistic GO models by a temperature-programmed reactive MD simulation. They further calculated the reactive adsorption of H2S and H2O/H2S mixtures on the as-generated atomistic GO structures. (271) H2S was observed to dissociate on the carbonyl functional groups, in agreement with the dynamic adsorption experiments; for the H2O/H2S mixtures, H2O molecules were preferentially adsorbed to the carbonyl sites, thus blocking the availability of active sites for H2S decomposition, again in agreement with the experimental findings.Mohamadalizadeh et al. investigated the sorption of pure H2S on AC, MWNTs, CNTs decorated with tungsten nanoparticles (W-CNTs), and amino-functionalized CNTs (F-CNTs). (272) Although these CNT-based materials have a surface area (100 m2/g) lower than that of AC (1000 m2/g), the saturation capacities for these systems (at 10 bar and 20 C) did not differ drastically, and CNTs showed better regenerability compared to AC.
3.6 Composite Materials
3.6.1 Metal Oxides/Mesoporous Silica
While metal oxide sorbents show high affinity for H2S, they suffer from limitations such as loss in surface area and porosity, and this subsequently results in degraded performance during cyclic sulfidation and regeneration. Ordered mesoporous molecular sieves that allow narrow pore sizes (16100 Å) tailored through the choice of surfactant, auxiliary chemicals, and reaction conditions were first discovered in the early 1990s. (273, 274) This seminal discovery enabling uniform pore sizes of mesoporous materials with high surface areas opened up a new area for novel heterogeneous catalysts.
Wang et al. for the first time investigated adsorption of H2S on metal-oxide-impregnated mesoporous silica, ZnO/SBA-15 (275) and Fe2O3/SBA-15. (276) The breakthrough capacities mentioned by those authors are not in accord with the breakthrough times they report; using the details of the experimental setup, we calculated new breakthrough capacities which are reported in Table 9. In an inert medium, H2S reacts chemically with metal oxides, and hence, at most the adsorbed amount can correspond to 100% utilization of the metal oxide on the high-surface-area substrates. However, these two studies show H2S adsorption far exceeding the theoretical maximum, suggesting that Claus reaction occurs between H2S and O2 from the air in the feed and the metal oxide functions as catalyst for this reaction rather that itself reacting with H2S to form metal sulfide.

Dhage et al. studied room-temperature H2S adsorption on transition-metal-promoted ZnO, impregnated on high-surface-area (550 m2/g) SiO2. (277) The ZnO/SiO2 system showed much higher absolute breakthrough capacities as well as percentage Zn utilization compared to their unsupported commercial counterparts from BASF and Sud-Chemie (see Table 9). It was observed that the sulfur capacity oscillated, reproducibly, with the number of cycles rather than monotonically increasing or decreasing. Using dopants such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu improved the utilization of ZnO, with the effect from copper being most prominent, changing the ZnO utilization at saturation from an already high 64% to about 93%. This increase does not seem to improve with the amount of copper, since the saturation capacities remained nearly unchanged upon increasing the Cu:Zn ratio from 0.05 to 0.25 at the same overall metal oxide loading. DFT studies showed that there is a significant energetic discrimination between H2S binding to a Cu2+ versus a Zn2+ site; this difference is smaller for H2O. (278) On a ZnO surface with some Zn2+ sites substituted with Cu2+, there can be a displacement of H2O with H2S at the Cu2+ surface sites. This is yet another explanation for the promoter effect by copper, in addition to several other arguments such as surface area and diffusion invoked earlier. Yang and Tatarchuk (279) also carried out similar studies and found significantly enhanced utilization by doping ZnO with copper or silver. In another study, they studied Fe- and Mn-promoted H2S sorbents supported on silica and found higher metal utilization compared to undoped ZnO; however, no significant preference was observed for Fe or Mn. (280) For the first time, real-time in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was performed during reactive adsorption of H2S. It was inferred that the surface of the sorbents is enriched with Fe promoter cations, while the Mn3+ promoter cations are located within the supported ZnO nanocrystallites. In situ experiments over multiple cycles may help to further elucidate the mechanism behind the oscillatory behavior.
Hussain et al. investigated the effect of different supports for ZnO; SBA-15 allows much higher breakthrough capacities as well as ZnO utilization. (281) This further highlights the importance of designing increasingly improved supports for metal oxides and suggests that Cu-Zn mixed oxides doped on SBA-15 may demonstrate a high capacity. In addition to capacity, stable performance of the adsorbent over several regeneration cycles is an important factor that may impact the economic viability of the process; in general, it is hard to reproducibly achieve the capacity of fresh adsorbents. (284-286) Generally, nanoparticles exhibit a tendency to grow into larger crystallites during the process of high-temperature regeneration. Inspired by the work of Prieto et al., who developed a highly stable methanol synthesis catalyst of Cu-ZnO nanoparticles on SBA-15, (288) Elyassi et al. investigated this adsorbent for H2S removal, resulting in extremely high and fully regenerable breakthrough capacities and ZnO utilization over five regeneration cycles. (282) The major drawback of such composite sorbents is that the active component forms only a small fraction of the overall mass of the material, so even though high metal oxide utilizations can be achieved, the absolute amount of H2S that can be removed per unit mass of the adsorbent remains low. Attempts to increase the loading of metal oxide have not succeeded in increasing the H2S capacity without loss in % utilization. (283, 284, 287) Future research to increase the fraction of the active material in the composite with high utilization of the active component and high regenerability of the sorbents will help develop even better materials.
3.6.2 Supported Amines
Supported amine adsorbents can be broadly classified into three classes: Class 1 constitutes adsorbents with physically loaded amine species, Class 2 adsorbents contain a covalent link between the amine and the solid support, mostly via silane chemistry or via polymeric supports with amine-containing side chains, and Class 3 adsorbents comprise porous supports upon which aminopolymers are polymerized in situ, starting from an amine-containing monomer. (289) Class 3 materials combine the higher amine loadings of class 1 materials and the enhanced stability of class 2 materials due to aminesupport covalent linkages. (290, 291) Huang et al. first reported on H2S removal using supported amines by employing high-surface-area silica supports (silica xerogel (816 m2/g) and MCM-48 (1389 m2/g)) functionalized with with 3-aminopropyl (CH2CH2CH2NH2) groups. (292) Adsorption/desorption was measured for pure-component H2S, CO2, and CH4, with and without moisture. At atmospheric pressure and temperature, the CO2/amino group ratio was observed to be 0.7 and 0.9 for xerogel and MCM-48, respectively. These ratios are 0.08 and 0.05 for CH4 and 0.29 and 0.25 for H2S at the highest measurement pressure of 0.001 atm (1000 ppmv) for xerogel and MCM-48, respectively. The sorbents could be almost completely regenerated by pressure swing or temperature swing at 75 C. The results indicated that the presence of water vapor doubled the amount of CO2 adsorbed and barely affected the H2S adsorption.
Zhou et al. explored Class 1 adsorbents by physically loading triethanolamine (C6H15O3N; TEA) on silica gel (335 m2/g). (293) Due to the weaker basicity of TEA, its sorption capacity is nearly 100 times less than that of amine-modified silicas. (292) The breakthrough capacity doubled on loading the silica gel with 20 wt% of TEA and increased 5-fold when the loading was increased to a mere 27.5 wt%. There is no clear explanation for this sudden rise in adsorption, except that small selective pores that are otherwise unexposed to TEA may get filled with TEA at a higher loading of 27.5 wt%. In a subsequent study, the authors used this system for studying a multi-cycle pressure swing adsorption setup. (294) In a follow-up work, the authors synthesized SBA-15 as a high specific surface area TEA carrier and reported that the amount of H2S adsorbed on the TEA-modified SBA-15 is 1.85 times more than that on the TEA-modified silica gel. (295) Xue and Liu tried another tertiary amine, methyl-diethyl-amine, loaded on SBA-15, and found an optimal amine loading of 60 wt% for an H2S breakthrough capacity of 0.1 mmol/g. (296) Although the adsorbed amine is stated to be methyldiethylamine, such low loadings, comparable to those for TEA, are more representative of methyldiethanolamine.
