SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the Carbon Capture and Separation special issue. 1 Introduction Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs. It is highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable in nature. Since H2S is heavier than air, it has a tendency to settle in low-lying and poorly ventilated areas (see Table 1 for the properties of H2S). It causes irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat at concentrations as low as 5 ppm and is fatal over 1000 ppm. (1) Inhalation is the primary route for H2S exposure. At 30 ppm, H2S paralyzes the sense of smell and is rapidly absorbed by the blood, resulting in poor oxygen uptake at the cellular level. Therefore, one should not fully trust their sense of smell for the presence of H2S because alarming concentrations may be present with no perceivable odor. Handling of H2S requires stringent safety regulations such as trained personnel, complete set of personal protective equipment including a gas mask, strategically located sensors, and emergency evacuation plans. Experimental studies with H2S at concentrations of a few hundred parts per million are challenging enough; the challenge is even greater at the percentage-level concentrations in actual gas-processing facilities.

It is also formed by the hydrolysis reaction of metal sulfides present in volcanic rocks. Anaerobic respiration of sulfate-reducing bacteria, whereby these organisms breathe sulfate to derive energy and release sulfide as waste, constitutes another major natural source of H2S. Landfills, rotten vegetation, and composting sites can also contribute to H2S generation; caution should be exercised in dealing with these not-so-obvious sources of H2S.

This process is essential to reduce the sulfur content of automobile and heating fuels, since combustion of sulfur compounds will result in emission of harmful sulfur oxides to the atmosphere that can, in turn, give rise to acid rain. Hydrodesulfurization is also important since sulfur compounds, often at very low concentrations, can deactivate noble metal catalysts for downstream catalytic reforming units. Gasification of coal and biomass for syngas (CO + H2) production, under high temperature and low oxygen concentrations, results in a conversion of the sulfur content of these resources into H2S.For any of the hydrocarbon streams, such as natural gas, biogas, or syngas, to be useful for energy generation or chemicals production, they need to be purified to remove unacceptable amounts of acid gases such as H2S and CO2. The acceptable H2S levels can be quite different depending on the end use; for example, 515 ppm H2S is acceptable in natural gas depending on the country of use, but <1 ppm H2S is required for fuel cell applications, where the electrodes are very susceptible to sulfur poisoning. The magnitudes of different streams that are processed globally are also quite different: for instance, over 120 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas is produced each year, while only about 1 trillion scf of biogas is produced annually. The optimal materials and processes for H2S removal from different sources and for different end applications can be quite different. In this Review, we will focus more on the technical aspects of the different alternative methods and processes. Detailed economic analysis of competing H2S-removal processes for specific feeds and applications is beyond the scope of this Review. While there is a significant overlap in materials for different H2S-capture problems, we will base our discussions mainly in the context of natural gas purification.Raw natural gas is a complex mixture of methane (CH4), ethane, and other light alkanes, H2S, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen, and water (H2O) vapor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies natural gas as sour at H2S concentrations above 4 ppm; (5)sweetening refers to removal of acidic sulfur compounds, primarily H2S. Natural gas emerging at the reservoir well head is subjected to low temperatures to condense out heavier hydrocarbons (see Figure 1). Overhead vapors are sent to the acid gas removal unit to selectively strip off H2S and CO2; amine-based absorption is most commonly used for this step. The H2S-rich stream is sent to the sulfur recovery unit (SRU), while the CH4-rich stream, after some post-processing steps such as dehydration, is sent to the pipeline as sales gas. In the SRU, sulfur is recovered by the well-known Claus process, where H2S undergoes high-temperature (1000 C) thermal oxidation,(1) prior to low-temperature (200300 C) catalytic oxidation,(2) (ΔH data from ref 6), in a series of reactors at progressively lower temperatures, accompanied by sulfur removal in intermediate condensers. Since the melting point of elemental sulfur is 115 C and sulfur deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, the temperature of the final Claus reactor is generally maintained above 200 C. This results in an incomplete conversion of H2S, and the resulting gas stream is sent to the tail gas treatment unit for additional sulfur recovery before the waste gases are released to the atmosphere. Thus, highly sour natural gas is usually processed for H2S removal in two different units, at two very different concentrations.Figure 1 Figure 1. Block diagram for natural gas processing.In addition to other papers in this special issue, Chemical Reviews has published three papers on the subject of CO2 capture in the past 5 years: Sumida et al. reviewed CO2 capture in metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), (7) Pera-Titus reviewed the capture process using porous inorganic membranes, (8) and Sanz-Prez et al. focused on chemical sorbents for the direct capture of CO2 from air. (9) However, similar reviews on H2S capture are few and limited in scope. (-10-16) Abatzoglou and Boivin reviewed biogas purification processes for removal of contaminants such as H2S, NH3, and siloxanes. (11) They divided the purification methods into two generic categories: those involving physicochemical phenomena and those involving biological processes. Most biotechnologies still require further optimization and scale-up in order to compete with their physical/chemical counterparts. (17) We will focus here on the physicochemical techniques for selective H2S removal; the reader interested in microbiological alternatives is referred to earlier reviews on the subject. (18, 19) The abundant literature available on H2S removal may be broadly classified into four categories: absorption, adsorption, membranes, and cryogenic distillation (see Figure 2). In this Review, we focus on materials and chemistries involved in each of these processes. Extensive review articles focus on solutions to tackle concentrated H2S by methods like the Claus process (20-22) or the production of hydrogen from H2S, (23) and these are not considered here.Figure 2 Figure 2. Different alternatives for sour gas sweetening.Since H2S is a polar molecule, while CH4 is a nonpolar molecule, it is obvious to imagine a polar solvent or a polar adsorbent surface to carry out this separation. However, the presence of other polar natural gas impurities such as H2O, which has a dipole moment about twice that of H2S, presents challenges to a simple polarity-based CH4/H2S separation. Exploiting the higher acidity of H2S compared to that of H2O using basic chemicals such as amines is also an alternative for sour gas sweetening. However, this principle of separation also suffers from some limitations due to the acidity of CO2 being higher than that of H2S and the concentration of CO2 in natural gas being generally much higher than that of H2S. The kinetic diameter of CH4 (3.8 Å) is slightly larger than that of H2S (3.6 Å); this might be another property that can be exploited for this particular gas separation using nanoporous adsorbents or membranes. Thus, while several possible solutions exist, challenges are associated with each of them, and it is important to evaluate these on a case-by-case basis. 2 Absorption The natural gas industry has relied on gas absorption for purification of raw natural gas for nearly 100 years, and this separation technique dominates most sour gas separations around the globe even today. A variety of different liquid solvents have been employed in a tray or a packed-bed configuration to selectively absorb H2S and CO2 from CH4 and light alkanes. Depending on the strength of interaction of gas molecules with the solvent and the nature of the absorption isotherm, these solvents maybe broadly classified into chemical and physical categories. For chemisorption, solubility of the gas in the liquid increases sharply at very low pressures and starts to plateau at higher pressures; the plateau is indicative of the stoichiometric capacity for the chemical reaction. In physisorption, the plateau is shifted to much higher pressures, and in many cases there is no plateau for the pressure range of interest, so solubility continues to increase, more or less linearly, with pressure. A sharp distinction between these categories does not exist (e.g., hydrogen bonding and weak charge transfer), and in reality, all solutesolvent combinations have some contribution from physisorption. For sour gas sweetening, alkanolamines are the most widely used class of chemical solvents. All other solvents usually absorb the gas physically, and their very high capacities make them of interest if a feed with high acid gas partial pressure is available.
2.1 Alkanolamines
Bottoms for the first time, in 1930, developed an absorption process for acid gases using alkanolamine solutions. (24) For several years, diethanolamine (DEA) was commonly used in refineries to remove acid gases. However, not only do H2S and CO2 concentrations in raw natural gas vary over a wide range of concentrations, but also since the toxicity of H2S is much higher than that of CO2, the upper-bound specifications for these impurities in the pipeline gas are also quite different (4 ppm for H2S and 2% for CO2). Clearly, the extent of H2S and CO2 removal required can be very different too. For example, nearly complete removal of H2S without any major removal of CO2 is desired for a feed gas containing high H2S concentration but CO2 concentration being already at 2%. Traditional alkanolamines absorb CO2 in preference to H2S; Frazier and Kohl first proposed the use of tertiary amines such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) for selective removal of H2S. (25) The CO2tertiary amine reaction,(3) proceeding via the bicarbonate formation, is relatively slow compared with the CO2primary and CO2secondary amine reactions, resulting in a carbamate ion,(4) while the H2Stertiary amine reaction, like all other amines, involves a proton transfer and is faster, (26) (5) MDEA not only offers kinetic selectivity toward H2S but also allows an equilibrium that favors the absorption of H2S over CO2. (25, 27) Besides MDEA, diisopropanolamine (DIPA), which is used in the Adip process developed by Shell, has also been reported to have a greater selectivity for H2S over CO2 than either monoethanolamine (MEA) or DEA. (28) In 1983, Sartori et al. investigated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), a sterically hindered amine, for CO2 removal at Exxon Research and Engineering Company. (29) Introducing steric hindrance by a bulky substituent adjacent to the amino group lowers the stability of the carbamate formed by the CO2amine reaction. Using kinetic modeling, the authors described as to how decreased carbamate stability leads to higher thermodynamic CO2 loadings approaching 1 mol of CO2 per mole of amine. Additionally, this leads to a higher free-amine concentration; therefore fast CO2amine reaction rates are obtained despite some reduction of the rate constant owing to steric interference. These hindered amines were found to be selective toward H2S over CO2 and have been commercialized as the Flexsorb process by Exxon Research and Engineering Company. It is claimed that the new hindered amine-based processes are potentially attractive replacements for the existing selective H2S removal processes, including the MDEA-based process. (28) Thorough knowledge of the vaporliquid equilibria for a gas/liquid combination is a prerequisite for accurate design of absorption columns. Classical thermodynamic modeling of acid gas absorption in aqueous alkanolamines, using either semi-empirical equilibrium constant approaches or activity coefficient methods, has been a subject of interest since the 1930s. Recently, Suleman et al. reviewed these models, discussing their classification, chronological development, salient features, and recommendations of appropriate models depending on the pressure and loading of the acid gases. (30)
2.2 Methanol
The Rectisol process, developed independently by Linde and Lurgi in the late 1950s, involves physical absorption using methanol at temperatures between 40 and 60 C. Since methanol has a low viscosity, it can be used for very low-temperature absorption processes, in particular for feeds with low partial pressures of acid gases. Since the high vapor pressure of methanol demands washing of all streams with liquid water in order to recover the methanol vapors, all streams are humidified during the process; the purified gas stream will also be humidified, thus requiring an additional step to meet the upper-bound H2O specifications for natural gas. The main application for the Rectisol process is purification of syngas derived from the gasification of heavy oil and coal rather than natural gas treating applications. (31) The multi-stage Ifpexol process, developed by Institut Francais du Petrole, can be used for natural gas applications. (32) Physical properties of various commercially used physical solvents for gas sweetening are listed in Table 3. (33, 34) Table 3.

2.3 N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone
Like the Rectisol process, the Purisol process is also a physical absorption process based on N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). However, due to its much lower vapor pressure, it can be operated at relatively higher temperatures without excessive solvent loss. Its operation at sub-ambient temperatures allows for simultaneous water removal since water is not required to wash the treated gas stream for solvent (NMP) recovery. Various advantages and limitations of the Rectisol and Purisol processes are covered in great detail elsewhere. (34, 35)
2.4 Poly(ethylene glycol) Dimethyl Ether
Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) is a mixture of CH3O(CH2CH2O)nCH3 oligomers with n = 29. Compared to the other solvents, PEGDME has a higher viscosity, which reduces mass-transfer rates and tray efficiencies and increases packing or tray requirements, especially at reduced temperatures. (34) However, it benefits from lower solvent vapor pressure, which prevents solvent losses in various streams, thus eliminating the need for water wash to recover the solvent and allowing for simultaneous dehydration of the feed to the desired dew point of sales gas. The Selexol process, developed by Allied Chemical Corporation, was first utilized in 1970.
2.5 Sulfolane and Diisopropanolamine
Unlike other physical solvents such as methanol, sulfolane are rarely used alone but rather in admixture with a chemical solvent such as an alkanolamine solution. (36) Shell Oils Sulfinol process, first developed by Dunn et al. in 1964, employs a mixed solvent consisting of DIPA, sulfolane, and water. (37) The presence of the physical solvent appreciably enhances the solution capacity, especially when the gas stream to be treated is available at high pressure and the acidic components are present in high concentrations. (38) There have been several subsequent studies to improve the chemical solvent; one such candidate is MDEA, a tertiary amine that has thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity toward H2S in the presence of CO2. (39-41) Currently, three different solvents are available for the Sulfinol process: Sulfinol-X consists of MDEA and piperazine, Sulfinol-M consists of MDEA, and Sulfinol-D consists of DIPA. (42)
2.6 Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts having moderately low melting points (<100 C), with their ionic character imparting them a large cohesive energy in the liquid phase, which in turn results in extremely low vapor pressures over a wide temperature range. This is a benefit for absorptive gas separation since the loss of solvent to the gas stream can be minimized. Additionally, many ILs are thermally very stable and are less combustible than other absorbents. Typically, an IL comprises a large, low-symmetry organic cation derived by alkyl substitution on parent cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, ammonium, and phosphonium and an inorganic or organic anion such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, acetate, methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, triflate, etc. (43) Due to their polar character, ILs show a high affinity for polar molecules such as H2O, CO2, and H2S, while nonpolar molecules like CH4 and other alkanes exhibit a much smaller solubility. In this section, we will discuss various advantages and shortcomings of ILs for H2S capture. The reader is also referred to earlier reviews on the subject. (44-46) Jou and Mather first investigated H2S absorption in an IL, 1-N-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim+][PF6]), and observed that H2S only physisorbed to the IL. (47) This further suggests that ILs are unlikely to replace alkanolamines completely but may be useful either for the bulk removal of high-partial-pressure acid gases or for mixing with a chemical solvent to increase capacity. Pomelli et al. extended this investigation to a wide range of cations and anions and demonstrated ILs with extremely high H2S solubilities. (62) They also carried out gas-phase electronic structure calculations elucidating the strong binding of H2S to the anion of the IL, with interaction energies of these complexes in the range of 3060 kJ/mol, indicating traditional hydrogen bonds. Experimental data for the Henrys law constants for H2S, CO2, and CH4 in various ILs are summarized in Table 4.Table 4. Henrys Law Constants for H2S, CO2, and CH4 in Ionic Liquids Henrys law constant (bar) ionic liquid T (C) H2S CO2 CH4 reference [bmim+][PF6] 25 14 53.4 1700 47, 48 [bmim+][Tf2N] 30 13 33   44, 49 40     500 50 [bmim+][BF4] 30 16 61.6 840 49, 51 hmim+][PF6] 30 18     52 [hmim+][Tf2N] 30 17 31.6 350 52, 53 [hmim+][BF4] 30 12     52 [hemim+][PF6] 30 28     54 [hemim+][Tf2N] 30 19 [hemim+][BF4] 30 31 108   54, 55 [emim+][PF6] 80 47     56 [emim+][Tf2N] 30 15 37 570 53, 56 [emim+][EtSO4] 30 60     57 [hmim+][Tf2N] 30 12     58 [omim+][Tf2N] 30 10 24 [emim+][Ace] 30 1.2     59 [emim+][Pro] 30 0.85 [emim+][Lac] 30 1.4 [bmim+][Ace] 30 0.90 [hmim+][Ace] 30 0.85 [MDEAH][Ac] 30 5.5 49   60 [MDEAH][For] 30 11.5 117 [DMEAH][Ac] 30 3.5 53 [DMEAH][For] 30 5.9 115 [BDMAEE][Tf2N] 25 2.47 29   61 Since sorption experiments are much more difficult to conduct for gas mixtures than for pure gases, an assumption needs to be invoked for defining absorption selectivity. There are at least two possible ways to define ideal absorption selectivity that have been used in the literature: (i) ratio of the solubilities at infinite dilution (Henrys law coefficients) and (ii) computing a mixture selectivity,(6) assuming that the amount absorbed for a mixture at a given partial pressure is equal to that for a pure case at the same total pressure. The answers obtained from the two definitions can be quite different. In order to assess the validity of ideal absorption selectivity approximation, Singh et al. (63) carried out molecular simulations for mixture absorption of CO2/H2 in [C4mim+][Tf2N] and [C6mim+][Tf2N] and found that definition (ii) for selectivity is in much better agreement with mixture selectivity. For CO2/CH4 absorption in [C4mim+][Tf2N], Budhathoki et al. observed definition (i) to be in better agreement with the mixture selectivity. (64) These differences demonstrate a lack of quantitative predictive capabilities to determine mixture absorption from pure-component data and suggest that either mixture measurements or mixture simulations with reliable force fields should indeed be carried out for at least the more promising ILs.Trends in affinity of H2S toward the anion of the IL were found to depend on the cation under consideration: [emim+][Tf2N] > [emim+][PF6], (56) [bmim+][Tf2N] > [bmim+][BF4] > [bmim+][PF6], (49) [hmim+][BF4] > [hmim+][PF6]  [hmim+][Tf2N], (52) and [hemim+][Tf2N]  [hemim+][OTf] > [hemim+][PF6] > [hemim+][BF4]. (54) These results indicate that H2S solubility is affected by both the cation and the anion of the IL, and it may not be possible to find the best anion and the best cation without trying all possible pairs. With the aid of molecular simulations, deeper insights can be gained about the entropic and enthalpic contributions of H2S solubilities in different ILs. Recently, Snchez-Badillo and co-workers computed solvation thermodynamics of H2S in ILs and demonstrated qualitative agreement with experimental data. (65) These calculations showed that, at room temperature, the absolute solvation enthalpy is 2 times higher than the absolute entropic contribution for [bmim+][PF6] and [bmim+][BF4] and 3 times higher for [bmim+][Cl]. The solubility of H2S in [bmim+][Tf2N] from molecular simulations was shown to be sensitive to the choice of the H2S force field; the TraPPE model resulted in the most accurate predictions. (66, 67) Jalili et al. also studied [C8mim+][Tf2N] and found that the solubility of H2S in [Cnmim+][Tf2N] ILs increases as the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent of the methylimidazolium cation, n, increases. (58) The authors explained that since the molar volume of the IL increases with n, possibly due to poorer interactions between bulkier cations and the anion, higher free volumes may result, in turn increasing the solubility. One must remember that such increased acid gas solubility due to increased free volumes will also lead to increased CH4 solubility, in turn reducing SH2S/CH4. As described previously with regard to how the necessity for selective H2S over CO2 absorption led to the development of absorbents such as MDEA, new solvents with SH2S/CO2 > 1 that also exert a low vapor pressure to reduce solvent losses will be interesting targets, and ILs, with their tunable polarity, can be ground-breaking candidates to achieve this selectivity. (68) Investigations of ternary systems consisting of H2S, CO2, and [C8mim+][Tf2N] showed SH2S/CO2  3 under ambient pressure and temperature. (58) All the studies conducted so far focused only on H2S and not on CH4 absorption. After all, for gas sweetening, selectivity is more important than solubility alone. Carvalho et al. suggested that the solubility of H2S in ILs is governed predominantly by entropic effects and that the most promising approach to enhance the sour gases/CH4 selectivities at high pressures is by lowering the methane solubility in ILs and not by increasing the sour gas solubility, which is essentially dependent on the solvent molar volume. (69) These authors measured CH4 solubility in four different ILs and demonstrated that it was highly dependent on the polarity of the IL and that, contrary to the previous selectivity models in the literature, (70, 71) the molar volume of the IL alone was not a sufficient criterion to tune selectivity. (72) While high solubility and selectivity for the desired molecule form the prerequisites for an IL to be useful for separation purposes, additional criteria such as thermal and mass transport through the IL can also contribute to the overall operating cost of the absorber. Due to their high cohesive energies, ILs demonstrate high viscosities, 13 orders of magnitude higher than for the conventional solvents. (73) Higher viscosities imply higher power consumption for gasliquid contact, but also an unusual possibility for diffusion-based selectivity in a gasliquid system. Under such circumstances, it will be helpful if the diffusivity of H2S is higher than that of CO2 in order to benefit from a transport selectivity. Reports investigating the diffusion of acid gases in ILs are limited. (55, 57, 74) At room temperature, [emim+][EtSO4] shows a high diffusion selectivity,  40, while [hemim+][BF4] shows  1.In 2002, Bates et al. first reported an IL designed for CO2 capture (task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs)) where a primary amine moiety is covalently tethered to an imidazolium cation for enhanced interaction with CO2. (75) Huang et al. employed carboxylate-based ILs for H2S capture, the Lewis base character of which resulted in higher absorption capacities. (59) These ILs absorb about 0.3 mol of H2S per mole of IL under ambient pressure at 60 C, about 15 times higher than conventional ILs. The enthalpy of this reactive absorption varies between 30 and 65 kJ/mol, depending on the cation and the anion, but is still lower than typical enthalpies of absorption in alkanolamines (80 kJ/mol). However, in spite of these favorable characteristics, the SH2S/CO2 in the carboxylate ILs is even worse than in the normal ILs due to the strong affinity of carboxylate ions toward CO2. (76) This challenge was overcome with the design of dual Lewis base functionalized ILs (DLB-ILs), (77) which have a tertiary amine group tethered to the carboxylate anion. It was found that the DLB-ILs could reversibly absorb 0.390.84 mol of H2S per mole of IL at 1 bar and 60 C, which is significantly higher than for other ILs. These DLB-ILs show SH2S/CO2  20 at 1 bar and SH2S/CO2 > 100 at pressures less than 0.1 bar. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the favorable geometry and energetics of the carboxylateH2Samine complex and the reduced CO2IL binding.Although TSILs can be modified for high H2S capacity and SH2S/CO2, their high costs and viscosity disfavor their application in industry. (60) This limitation encouraged the same authors to explore protic ionic liquid (PILs), which are a class of low-cost ILs that can be easily prepared from simple materials through direct neutralization between the corresponding acid and base. (60, 78) For instance, mixing dimethylethanolamine and acetic acid yields dimethylethanolammonium acetate ([DMEAH][Ac]). It was demonstrated that [DMEAH][Ac] and dimethylethanolammonium formate ([DMEAH][For]) have SH2S/CO2 greater than those of normal ILs and any other organic solvent.Another issue with TSILs is that they are highly hydrophilic and miscible with water, thus increasing the expense of regeneration by requiring energy for removing bound water. Both the cation and anion can affect the mutual solubilities between water and ILs, but the anion plays the major role in determining their phase behavior. (79) Huang et al. (61) synthesized half-protonated diamines with a free tertiary amine group (disfavoring CO2) tethered on the cations and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Tf2N]) as the anion, which is a well-known building block for hydrophobic ILs with low viscosity. (79) Although these ILs have H2S absorption capacity similar to that of other TSILs reported in the literature on a mole ratio basis, they have a molecular weight nearly twice that of other TSILs, making capacity on molality basis (per mass of IL) nearly half.As described earlier, compared to common organic solvents with high vapor pressures, ILs contribute negligible volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere, thus reducing the issue of atmospheric emissions. However, it has been noted in the literature that most ILs are not intrinsically green, (80) and similar to other commercial organic solvents, irresponsible release of them will pose a threat to the environment. One of the key issues here is that, unlike the common solvents, the toxicity of ILs is not fully characterized. However, at least in principle, the large design space of ILs should allow for designing solvents that not only are effective for the application of interest but also pose no serious ecological threat. In an attempt to explore environmentally benign solvents, Guo et al. synthesized and measured H2S absorption in a series of caprolactam tetrabutylammonium bromide (CPLTBAB) ILs with different mole ratios of CPL and TBAB. (81) For the 1:1 CPLTBAB mixture, the solubilities of pure H2S at atmospheric pressure are 0.69 and 0.44 mol of H2S per mole of IL at 30 and 90 C, respectively.Heldebrant et al. developed a new class of CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2BOLs) that chemically and reversibly absorb CO2. (82) These organic liquids are mixtures of organic alcohols and amidine/guanidine bases. Since these organic liquids have lower specific heats compared to H2O and also since they require much lower regeneration temperatures, a higher energy efficiency can be achieved during absorption/regeneration cycles. Following on the capture of acid gases such as CO2, SO2, CS2, and COS using such organic liquids, (82, 83) it was hypothesized that weak bases such as tertiary alkanolamines (anhydrous) could react with H2S to form liquid hydrosulfide salts that could be used as reversible H2S-binding organic liquids (H2SBOLs). (84) These authors demonstrated desorption of H2S by either inert gas sparging or mild heating, or even at room temperature by the addition of low-specific-heat antisolvents such as hexanes that can be boiled at 5070 C. BOLs are non-ionic before reacting with the gas molecule; however, after chemically reacting with the gas, they become ILs.Very similar in properties to ILs, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a relatively new class of solvents that are formed by complexing a large, asymmetric quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt or a hydrogen bond donor. (85) Hydrogen bonding in the system results in charge delocalization, thus lowering the lattice energy and decreasing the melting point of the mixture relative to the melting points of the individual components. (86) In addition to most of the better solvent properties of ILs, DESs are generally more biodegradable, less toxic, and inexpensive, thus making these solvents more sustainable. Articles on CO2 capture using DESs have started to appear in the past few years, (87, 88) and CO2 removal from natural gas was reviewed recently. (89) To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature on H2S capture, and this might be an unexplored opportunity to discover novel solvents for this application.Since 2010, several research groups have started to focus on equations of state (EoS) modeling of H2S + ILs phase behavior. (90-98) A major drawback in the use of the most prevalent cubic EoS is that they require critical parameters of the ILs that can only be obtained indirectly and with large uncertainties, limiting their utility to correlation purposes only. (99) In contrast, contributions from various energetic interactions, such as dipoledipole, quadrupolequadrupole, and dipolequadrupole, can be explicitly included in a class of equations based on the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) formalism. (90, 92) Several other correlation techniques that use molecular weight, critical temperature and pressure, and acentric factor as input variables have been applied to H2S absorption in ILs. (100-103) Group contribution methods, requiring only the number and type of each fragment type as the input, were used to establish a comprehensive database on the solubility of H2S in ILs using 1334 pieces of data covering the period from 2007 to 2016. (104) Lei et al. employed the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) to predict the solubilities of different gases, including H2S, in ILs and observed deviations of less than 40%. (43) This approach requires only the molecular structure and is independent of any experimental correlation. In another study, Mortazavi-Manesh et al. used COSMO-RS to screen 425 ILs for sour gas separations and, based on binary selectivities, suggested 58 promising ILs with H2S/CH4, H2S/C2H6, and H2S/CO2 selectivities in the ranges 5175, 1123, and 2.63.4, respectively. (105) In 1977, Tennyson and Schaaf provided some guidelines for the choice of appropriate physical/chemical solvent depending on the partial pressures of acid gases in the feed and product gas streams. (106) Process optimization for absorption using ILs in comparison to the commercial solvents can help identify the partial pressure regimes under which certain ILs may be preferred over conventional solvents. The past decade has seen several reports demonstrating high H2SIL affinities, but ILs for selective acid gas removal are still in the design stage. Several design variables, such as length of the alkyl chains on the cation, branching of the alkyl chain, task-specific functional groups, pairing with appropriate anions, etc., make this a multi-dimensional combinatorial problem. As is shown in several fundamental studies for discovery of novel solid adsorbents, insights from molecular simulations can potentially speed up discovery of optimal ILs and DESs for H2S capture. Additionally, simulations can also help understand the differences between selectivities calculated from pure-component absorption isotherms and those observed in an actual mixture measurement. In conclusion, while ILs enjoy clear advantages such as design flexibility and negligible vapor pressures, properties such as viscosity, diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and reaction kinetics in ILs under varying temperatures and partial pressures of acid gases require thorough investigations in order to compare these new solvents with the conventional solvents that have been successfully commercialized for several decades. 3 Adsorption Adsorptive separation involves the use of a selective and high-capacity solid substrate that shows a preferential affinity for one or more molecule types from their mixtures. Similar to absorption, adsorption may also be classified as physisorption and chemisorption, depending on the strength of sorbatesorbent interactions. In addition to interaction-based separation, different sizes and shapes of molecules can also be exploited for selective removal of one compound over another. In this section, we will discuss a variety of adsorbents, such as metal oxides, MOFs, zeolites, carbons, and composite materials, for H2S capture from gas mixtures containing CH4, CO2, N2, H2, and/or H2O. For any adsorption application, it is desirable that the adsorbent has a high separation selectivity for the molecule of interest (primarily H2S in this case) and also a high capacity for the adsorbate. In addition to capacity and selectivity, stability under extreme acid gas environments as well as performance and structural regenerability are important for longer lifetime of the adsorbent bed.
3.1 Metal Oxides
Since the 1960s, metal oxides have been used for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas. (107, 108) Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively; (109, 110) this large body of literature is beyond the scope of this Review, and we focus here mostly on low to moderate temperatures (25300 C) that are of relevance to natural gas sweetening, including the Claus tail gas.
In 1976, Westmoreland and Harrison screened for the high-temperature (4001200 C) desulfurization potential of oxides of 28 elements with computational free energy minimizations of a C-H-N-O-S elemental system in the presence of the metal oxide using temperature-dependent free energies from the literature. (111) Eleven candidate solids, based upon the metals Fe, Zn, Mo, Mn, V, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Cu, and W, showed thermodynamic feasibility (at least 95% desulfurization and solid stability) for high-temperature desulfurization. Another simulation study at 400 C with feed containing 12.5% CO2, 42.5% CO, 32.175% H2, 12.5% H2O, and 3250 ppm H2S showed that oxides of Zn, Mo, Mn, W, Sn, Co, Cu, Ni, and Fe should be successful in reducing the residual H2S content to 0.03, 0.6, 2.5, 3.4, 19, 24, 39, 41, and 91 ppm, respectively. (112) Rodriguez et al. studied adsorption of H2S on a series of metal oxide surfaces using synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission. (113, 114) It was observed that the smaller the band gap in the oxide, the bigger its reactivity toward S-containing molecules (see Figure 3). Ab initio self-consistent field (SCF) theory calculations and experimental data indicated that the reactivity of an oxide mainly depends on how well its bands mix with the orbitals of H2S or HS. (113) Oxides possessing a large ionicity, like Al2O3 and MgO, displayed the lowest reactivity toward H2S, indicating that the electrostatic interactions between the dipole of H2S and the ionic field generated by the charges in an oxide may play only a secondary role in the adsorption process. (114) As can be seen from Figure 3, Cr3O4 interacts strongly with H2S. Even before this study, the most significant evolution of the Claus process, the Superclaus process, employed an α-alumina support coated with a mixture of iron and chromium oxides as the catalyst. (115) However, due to the severe toxicity of chromia, continuing research to develop new catalysts for this important reaction is underway. (116) CuO and Cu2O have band gaps of 1.2 and 2.1 eV, respectively; the contribution by Rodriguez et al. should imply better desulfurization using CuO compared to Cu2O. Room-temperature experimental screening of oxides of Ag, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Ca, Mn, and Sn showed a conversion of 66% for CuO but <10% for the other oxides. (117) Figure 3 Figure 3.

Copyright 1999 AIP Publishing.Several DFT studies on H2S reaction with oxides of Zn, (118, 119) Fe, (120) Ce, (121) Ti, (122) Mn, (123) V, (124, 125) Cu, (126, 127) Co, (128) and Mg (129) have been carried out in the past decade. While these studies provide some details of possible reaction mechanisms for each metal oxide, a comparative study of different pure and mixed oxides for adsorption and regeneration from first-principles calculations, at the same level of theory, can provide insights into optimal metal oxide selection. Jia et al. carried out a comparative study of the reactions of MmOn (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) with H2S using mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. (130) The authors tested several density functionals by calculating the bond enthalpies of MO, MS, HSH, and SH species, and except for ZnS, the B3LYP functional was found to be generally in better agreement with the experimental enthalpies.Adsorption of H2S by ZnO is stoichiometric at 350 C but falls off rapidly as the temperature is reduced. (131) Since this is an exothermic reaction, this decline in conversion is due to slower reaction kinetics. Baird et al. reported 91% conversion of Co3O4 at room temperature, (132) while Xue et al. reported only a 1% conversion. (117) These studies suggest the possible implications of synthesis recipes on the size, shape, and surface area of the metal oxide particles that can, in turn affect the H2S breakthrough capacity. In fact, there are several reports exploring desulfurization using different ZnO morphologies. (133-138) While it is hard to draw a head-to-head comparison between independent studies due to different gas velocities, reactor volume, feed compositions, and definitions of breakthrough concentration, data for these are compiled in Table 5. The % utilization for a metal oxide-based adsorbent is defined as the ratio of the actual amount of H2S adsorbed to the theoretical amount of H2S adsorbed by complete conversion of metal oxide to metal sulfide, multiplied by 100. Note that the value can change depending on the choice of the oxidation state of the metal in its oxide and sulfide forms. This number can be greater than 100 due to H2S adsorbing without chemical reaction with the metal oxide (see, for instance, the H2S adsorption on metal oxides impregnated on high-surface-area silica supports).Table 5.

(136) Zn(acac)2, heat 14 11 Zn(NO3)2, heat 14 5.1 The reaction between H2S and a metal oxide in the absence of O2 belongs to the class of non-catalytic gassolid reactions. These reactions have been most commonly analyzed using either the unreacted shrinking core model (USCM) (139) or the grain model. (140) USCM is built on the assumption that the reaction is much faster than the diffusion and, hence, the reaction occurs at the solid reactant surface. This model clearly assumes inward propagation of the reaction front. In the grain model, each of the large number of spherical grains in a solid pellet is assumed to react independently according to the USCM. Early reports on sulfidation kinetics of ZnO, employing the grain model with constant or varying properties (size changes due to sintering and reaction) of the adsorbent, agreed quantitatively with experiments. (141, 142) From the time when empirical commercialization of ZnO as a desulfurization sorbent took precedence until the early 1990s, very little was known about the structural changes and the mechanism for this reaction. Using in situ sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in the soft X-ray region (<5000 eV), Evans and co-workers first showed that the reaction of ZnO and H2S occurs via island formation of ZnS on the oxide surface and, as the reaction proceeds, eventually bulk regions of ZnS are formed. (143, 144) Since there was no apparent shift in the edge energies of the S K-edge spectra, it was concluded that the oxidation state of the sulfur remains as S2 throughout the process. (143) The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the final states of the adsorbent confirmed the theory of a two-phase material consisting of crystalline ZnO (wurtzite) and a less ordered phase of ZnS (wurtzite), in spite of the fact that ZnS blend structure is thermodynamically more stable. (144) The reader is also referred to a review paper by Samokhvalov et al. on the low-temperature desulfurization using ZnO. (145) Until recently, ZnO sulfidation models assumed inward diffusion of H2S, but Neveux et al. showed evidence for an outward growth mechanism (see Figure 4). (146, 147) Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography, the authors observed voids inside the ZnS particle, suggesting that the Zn2+ and O2 species diffuse through the product ZnS layer. Since the external particle surface increases during the course of the reaction, the decrease in reaction rate with time cannot be explained if the rate-determining step (RDS) is located at the external surface (adsorption, desorption, external interface reaction). Thus, the authors proposed that diffusion through the ZnS layer is most likely to be the RDS. Eight elementary steps of the sulfidation reaction were proposed, with the outward growth of ZnS and diffusion of zinc and oxygen through ZnS. (147) The authors derived a rate expression that also considered the evolution of the voids by a nucleationgrowth mechanism, and the model predictions agreed quantitatively with experiments.Figure 4 Figure 4. Two mechanisms of ZnS growth starting from pure ZnO (center): (a) inward ZnS growth and (b) outward ZnS growth. Reprinted with permission from ref 150. Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society.To enhance the H2S capacity at lower temperatures, another approach of varying the ZnO morphology involves doping with other metallic species (see Table 6). (117, 131, 132, 148-153) Skrzypski et al. studied mixed CuZn oxides and found a 6-fold increase in capacity at 200 C by doping 6 mol% Cu. (148) XPS of pristine Cu0.03Zn0.97O showed a Cu 2p3/2 peak (933.5 eV), characteristic of Cu2+ surrounded by oxygen; after only partial sulfidation, this peak shifted to lower energy (932.6 eV), indicating the appearance of Cu+ in a sulfide environment. The sulfidation mechanism of these mixed oxides was further investigated using TEM and in situ synchrotron XRD. (150) While non-doped ZnO at 250 C resulted in void formation at the ZnO/ZnS interface, Cu-doped ZnO showed no cavity formation; this suggests an inward growth mechanism where S2 anions diffuse from the external surface to the internal ZnO/ZnS interface and exchange with O2 anions. This radical change in mechanism was attributed to the presence of sulfur vacancies in the ZnS layer due to partial replacement of Zn2+ by Cu+; these anionic vacancies accelerate the diffusion of sulfur to yield higher conversions of CuZn oxides. XRD measurements showed that the size of the ZnS crystallites formed from non-doped ZnO remains constant during the reaction. In contrast, the pronounced growth of Cu-doped samples enhances the mobility of sulfur anions in Cu-containing ZnS particles.Table 6.

Co3O4 (100/0) 87 92 Jiang et al. also studied CuZn and CuZnAl mixed metal oxides prepared via co-precipitation (cp) or multi-precipitation (mp) methods. (149) Better dispersion by aluminum results in smaller mean crystalline sizes and higher specific surface area of Al-containing sorbents; breakthrough sulfur capacities also improve as a result of reducing the thickness of the potential sulfide shell on the outer layer of the oxide, in turn reducing the diffusion path length. The Cu-rich adsorbents were more suitable for H2S adsorption than the Zn-rich adsorbents, with mp-Cu80Zn10Al10 reaching nearly complete conversion at 80 C. XRD of sulfidated samples revealed that the CuS peaks were much more dominant compared to the CuO peaks, but high-intensity ZnO peaks persisted for sulfidated Zn-rich samples. This suggests that CuS penetrated deep into the crystal, while ZnS likely formed only surface layers. Since the anionic sites in ZnO need to rearrange from hexagonal to cubic lattice on sulfidation, while those in CuO need only to transform from monoclinic to hexagonal, a faster sulfidation rate was proposed for CuO than that for ZnO. Similar structural arguments were invoked for ZnCo oxides (discussed below) by Baird et al. (132) It should be noted here that the sulfidation reaction in the study by Jiang et al. was carried out at 40 C, (149) as opposed to a much higher temperature (370 C) in the study by Hayter et al. (discussed above) (144) that reported the wurtzite (hexagonal) phase of ZnS. This suggests that temperature can play a role in stabilizing different crystal structures of the product metal sulfide, which in turn can influence the overall sulfidation kinetics.
Co-precipitated mixed oxides showed smaller particle sizes, higher specific surface areas, and a higher H2S capacity compared to their impregnated counterparts that are synthesized by immersing the parent oxide in a salt solution of the dopant metal and calcining this precursor at 350 C. (131) These authors also studied adsorption on single-phase CoZnAlO prepared from co-precipitated hydroxycarbonate precursors (hydrotalcite-type structure). (151) The presence of aluminum increased the specific surface areas, but the modified compounds did not adsorb significantly more H2S per metallic (Zn, Co) species. H2S adsorption in CoZn oxides with varying Co/Zn atomic ratios showed that the increase in % utilization correlates well with the increase in surface area; the main function of Co doping seems to be increasing the surface area by reducing the particle size. (132) Thermodynamically, Co3O4 has a more negative free energy for sulfidation than ZnO. Additionally, sulfiding cubic Co3O4 normal spinel to spinel Co3S4 or Co8S9 will require lesser lattice rearrangement than that for hexagonal ZnO to cubic ZnS.
Westmoreland et al. showed that the intrinsic reaction rate of H2S with MnO over a temperature range of 300800 C is approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than that with ZnO, even though its surface area was an order of magnitude smaller. (154) Higher conversions were observed for mixed oxides of Zn containing Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Zr at room temperature, especially for Zn2.9MnO4.2, but the reason for poor conversion for pure Mn3O4 solid is not yet clear. (117) Regeneration of ZnTi-based mixed metal oxides using 20% O2 in He at 750 C for 4 h showed broad XRD peaks of very low intensity, indicating transformation to an amorphous material. (152) Doping this oxide with Mn, Cu, or Mo led to an improvement in H2S uptake for the regenerated solid: 41 mg/g for 10Mn45Zn45TiO using a feed of 600 ppm H2S, 25% H2, and 7.5% CO2 in helium. The presence of 1% H2O in the feed leads to a significantly higher capacity (160 mg/g). Davidson et al. have demonstrated the autocatalytic role of water during desulfurization on ZnO, suggesting a mechanism involving proton transfer from H2S to chemisorbed OH groups from hydration of the surface. (137, 155) Addition of Fe showed a pronounced effect of Fe/Mn molar ratio on the morphology of the FeMnZnTi mixed oxide crystallites. (116) H2S uptakes of 82 mg/g and 17 mg/g were observed for 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO and 20Fe40Zn40TiO, respectively; in this case, 1% H2O led to only a small increase in capacity to 100 mg/g. Mssbauer spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the energy levels of an atomic nucleus in response to its environment; quadrupole splitting (Δ) is induced by an electric field gradient of nearby electrons. Changes in Δ during sulfidation and regeneration in the case of 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO solid, compared to no changes for 20Fe40Zn40TiO solid, suggest that Mn makes the mixed oxide structures more susceptible to structural distortions, in turn enhancing H2S adsorption. Regeneration in 20% O2 in He at 500 C for 4 h resulted in over 80% of capacity recovered for the Fe-containing solids, while regeneration at 750 C halved the H2S capacity. The structure was preserved for the regenerated 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO solid with clear peaks in the XRD pattern.
Liu et al. investigated copper-based cp-mixed oxides (see Table 7) and observed high capacities for Fe-doped oxides. (157) Capacities were 1040% higher for H2S in bulk N2 compared to the case of bulk CO2, suggesting some degree of competitive adsorption with CO2; the inhibition effect was lower for doped CuO compared to pure CuO. The authors report that regenerated CuO exhibited a breakthrough capacity up to 75% of its initial value when regenerated between 100 and 200 C but decreased rapidly with further increase of regeneration temperature. The authors explain that CuS tends to decompose into the more stable Cu2S when the temperature is above 220 C. The authors carried out five adsorptionregeneration cycles for pure CuO, CuAlO, and FeCuAlO with regeneration using air at 100 C. For CuO, the regenerated capacities were maintained at 75% of the fresh adsorbent capacity; however, regenerated capacities decreased for the CuAlO and FeCuAlO adsorbents and became steady during the last two cycles at 50% and 43% of the fresh capacity, respectively. These studies bring to light the difficulty in regenerating the high capacities of mixed metal oxides; future work in this area should focus not only on high-capacity sorbents but also on better regenerability.

(158, 159) Highly uniform polystyrene (PS) beads ordered into close-packed domains were used as a template for the growth of the inorganic 3DOM structure; the resulting pore diameters were considerably smaller than the original PS sphere. (158) The shrinkage in size resulting from sintering during calcination ranged from 45 to 59% for the 3DOM-F sorbents and from 37 to 45% for the 3DOM-FS sorbents. 3DOM-FS showed somewhat smaller nanoparticles (5 nm) than 3DOM-F (25 nm), which the authors explain as silicon keeping the iron grains separate and preventing the latter from growing larger during calcination. Depending on the macropore diameter, these structures have variable surface areas, ranging from 16 to 44 m2/g for 3DOM-F and from 80 to 220 m2/g for 3DOM-FS. Mesopore-sized void spaces between the crystallites are observed in the TEM images and also from the pore size distribution (2033 and 617 nm for 3DOM-F and 3DOM-FS, respectively) obtained from the N2 isotherms. It can be seen that the % utilization of Fe improves with increase in macropore diameter up to about 150 nm due to possible reduction in diffusion limitations, but further increasing the macropore diameter leads to a lowering of Fe utilization. Nearly complete regeneration of 3DOM-FS samples using 2% O2 in N2 at 300 C was shown for three cycles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated that, despite some cracking, the macroporosity and ordering of the structure was still intact and the overall 3DOM structure was retained after second regeneration.

(159) Breakthrough capacities showed an increase with increase in Fe:Si ratio up to 8; low capacity at even higher Fe:Si ratios was attributed to the presence of α-Fe2O3. SiO2 enhanced the dispersion of Fe2O3, which stabilized the γ-Fe2O3 and hindered its transformation to α-Fe2O3 during calcination. The authors further explain that the vacancy site in the lattice of γ-Fe2O3, accompanied by its lower density, larger surface area, and smaller grain size, facilitates ion diffusion. Relative humidity of 10% favored H2S removal. It was also found that conventional regeneration at 300 C using 5% O2 in N2 resulted in a drastic loss of capacity for the regenerated material. As an alternative regeneration technique, the authors proposed an in situ regeneration process by adding 5% O2 to the feed stream (desulfurization and regeneration occur at the same time); this resulted in breakthrough capacities twice those observed when O2 was absent from the inlet gas. In the case of conventional regeneration, a significant fraction of γ-Fe2O3 transformed to α-Fe2O3, while no such change was observed for the case where O2 was added to the feed. It is unclear if this simultaneous desulfurizationregeneration process is resulting in a transformation of H2S to SO2; monitoring only H2S concentration in the outlet stream may hint at high H2S breakthrough capacity, but monitoring SO2 concentration may reveal that little or no sulfur is adsorbed in such a process.
In another study, Wang et al. synthesized 3DOM structures of ZnO and silica, with different weight percent of ZnO ranging from 23 to 70%. (160) Samples exhibited a typical amorphous structure, except 3DOM-SZ73, which showed peaks corresponding to ZnO in the XRD pattern. Highest utilization of 69% was observed for the 3DOM structure with 50 wt% ZnO; nearly 70% of this capacity was retained for four regeneration cycles (air at 500 C for 4 h). These adsorbents hold significant promise for desulfurization at ambient temperature, and investigation of structural stability over several regeneration cycles will help reveal the true potential of these sorbents for commercial application.
Even though cobalt oxide is one of the thermodynamically more favorable metals for desulfurization of H2S, attempts at making it a major component for removing H2S are limited. (132, 162) Due to larger particle sizes, bulk cobalt oxide showed slower sulfidation and incomplete conversion even at 500 C, but when it was supported on either Al2O3 or TiO2, higher rates and complete conversion could be observed even at 300 C, primarily due to smaller grain size. (162) TiO2-supported Co3O4 showed lower activation barriers, and it may serve as an effective H2S removal sorbent, even at lower temperatures. Pahalagedara et al. investigated mesoporous cobalt oxides (m-Co-X, where X = 150, 250, 350, or 450 C, the calcination temperature) as desulfurization sorbents and could achieve 100% capacity at 150 C. (161) The reason for breakthrough capacities higher than 100% metal utilization for mesoporous Co and Mn is not clear but may be attributed to physically adsorbed H2S beyond the chemically reacted capacity. The authors also investigated other mesoporous materials (Cr2O3, CuO, Mn2O3, and Fe2O3) that showed superior activities compared to their nonporous analogues (as high as 200 times). Using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), the mesostructure was shown to be preserved after sulfidation, but the mesostructure collapsed during calcination at 450 C, and regeneration at 400 C in air resulted in a 45% drop in capacity. An alternative regeneration technique for ZnO catalysts using a 3:1 H2O/N2 mixture at 800 C resulted in nearly 100% capacity regeneration without loss of porosity, as opposed to only about 10% regeneration and significant increase in bulk density of the adsorbent when air was used at the same temperature. (163) A significant scope still remains for developing better regeneration procedures for metal oxides that retain not only the adsorption capacity reversibility but also the structural reversibility. The latter is more important from the perspective of adsorbent bed stability to prevent attrition of the solids that will increase the pressure drop across the bed.
3.2 Metals
Early literature focused on H2S poisoning of metal catalysts and the threshold concentration below which H2S will not unduly poison a given metal catalyst. McCarty and Wise investigated the thermodynamics of H2S chemisorption on different metallic catalysts over a wide range of temperatures and reported the order of increasing activity toward H2S at 300 C and 50% surface coverage to be Ni > Co > Ru > Fe > Pt. (164-167) Using magnetization measurements, Den Besten and Selwood showed that H2S is dissociatively chemisorbed on the Ni surface. (168) The enthalpy of adsorption of H2S on Ni was measured to be about 130160 kJ/mol. (164, 169) Due to such high enthalpies of adsorption, adsorbent regeneration will result in a very expensive natural gas desulfurization process. Metal adsorbents may be useful as a final polishing step to limit the energy duty for H2S adsorption/regeneration. For example, they can be useful in certain applications such as direct-methane fuel cells (170) to achieve ultra-low sulfur content methane from pre-treated natural gas.
