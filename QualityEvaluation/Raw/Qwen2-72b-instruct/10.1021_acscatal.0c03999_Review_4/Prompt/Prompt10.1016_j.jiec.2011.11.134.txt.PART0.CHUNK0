1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important raw materials used in the industrial processes, such as the production of polypropene,polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid. The catalytic dehy- drogenation of propane to propene has drawn intense attention recently since the conventional production of propene from steam cracking and FCC is not sufficient to meet the increasing market demand. The present industrial process of propane dehydroge- nation is not optimal due to the quick deactivation of catalysts during the reaction [1,2]. Many efforts have been made to overcome this shortcoming, such as by oxidative dehydrogena- tion of propane using oxygen. Unfortunately, the selectivity to propene is relatively low in the reaction because of the over- oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide. The oxidative dehydro- genation of propane by carbon dioxide, a milder oxidation agent,has been recently proposed as an alternative route to the above process. In this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than that in the commercial one. Moreover, since carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the utilization of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically.
Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 based catalysts are found to be more efficient than others in this reaction [39]. However, their stability is still an unsolved problem, which is fatal for industrial application. In our previous work, HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased [1012]. The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]. However, the selectivity to propene is not high enough because of the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation.
Ga-promoted HZSM-5 has been studied intensely as an efficient catalyst in aromatization of propane. The aromatization reaction was thought to proceed via a bifunctional mechanism, in which gallium oxide was responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane, while Brnsted acid sites accounted for catalyzing the oligomerization of the olefins produced and their subsequent aromatization [1318]. In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20].
In the present work, Ga2O3 catalysts supported on HZSM-48 with high Si/Al ratios were prepared and characterized by XRD,
XRF,
27Al MAS NMR, SEM and N2 adsorption. Their catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 was investigated and compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5. The influence of acidity of the HZSM-48 support as well as the pore geometry on the catalytic dehydrogenation is also discussed.

The catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation over HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was investigated, and compared with that of HZSM-5 supported ones. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. However, their stabilities are not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. 2011 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZSM-48 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared following the procedures in the literature [20]. Typically, a certain amount of Al2(SO4)3H2O was dripped slowly into a solution containing 1.48 g of NaOH, 0.83 g of H2SO4 (98%) and 13.1 g of 1,6- hexanediamine (HDA) under stirring, then, 37.5 g of colloidal silica (40% SiO2) was added. After being aged at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and crystallized at 170 8C for 48 h. The products were filtered, washed and dried at 120 8C in air and then calcined at 600 8C for 5 h. The as-synthesized ZSM-48 zeolites were turned into the H-form by ion exchanging with 1 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 8C for 2 h, filtered and washed. The above ion exchange process was repeated twice more. The final products were then calcined in air at 600 8C for 3 h.
The supported catalysts were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3xH2O (Aldrich) on HZSM-48 using an incipient wetness method. The impregnated samples were dried at 100 8C overnight and calcined at 600 8C for 6 h in air. The obtained catalysts are denoted as Ga2O3/HZSM-48(x), where x represents the molar ratio of Si/Al. The content of Ga2O3 in all the catalysts was 5 wt%.
HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts were prepared according to the procedures in other literature [12] and denoted as Ga2O3/ HZSM-5(x).
2.2. Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The bulk Si/Al ratios of the prepared ZSM-48 zeolites were measured by the X-ray fluores- cence spectra (XRF) on a Bruker-AXS S4 Explorer. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were obtained on a Philips XL-30 scanning electron microscope. The BET surface areas and micropore volumes of the catalysts were analyzed by
N2
adsorption at 196 8C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instru- ment. 27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DSX-300 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 78.2 MHz.
Spectra were recorded at a spinning rate of 12 kHz, a pulse length of 0.31 ms and a delay time of 0.5 s. All the samples were hydrated in a desiccator over a saturated NaCl solution for 3 days prior to the measurements. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in flowing air on a Perkin Elmer TGA 7 to determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after reaction.
The surface acidity was measured by temperature-pro- grammed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) in a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure. A 100-mg sample was preheated at 550 8C for 2 h, and then cooled to 120 8C in flowing helium. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of ammonia were injected until adsorption saturation occurred, followed by purging with helium for 2 h. The temperature was then raised from 120 to 600 8C at a rate of 10 8C/min, and the ammonia desorbed was collected in a liquid nitrogen trap and detected by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a TCD.
2.3. Reaction testing
The activities of the samples toward cumene cracking were tested in a pulse microreactor. The catalyst with loading of 40 mg was preheated at 350 8C for 2 h before reaction. Hydrogen with a flow rate of 40 mL/min was used as the carrier gas. The reactions were conducted at 350 8C, and 1 mL cumene was injected for each test. The products were analyzed by an on-line GC equipped with a TCD detector.
Catalytic tests for propane dehydrogenation were performed at 600 8C in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure.
The catalyst (200 mg) was activated at 600 8C for 1 h in nitrogen flow prior to the reaction. The gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% carbon dioxide and balancing nitrogen, unless otherwise stated. The total flow rate of the gas reactant is 20 mL/ min. The external/internal mass transfer limitations can be negligible under this condition. The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed using an on-line GC equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a FID. The gas products, including CO and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped with a 2-m packed column of carbon molecular sieve 601 and a TCD.
To maintain the carbon balance, undetected carbonaceous species in products were included into the aromatics. The reaction data in this work were reproducible with a precision of less than 5%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The HZSM-48 supports with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by a hydrothermal method and their XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The Si/Al ratio in the reactant mixture plays a key role in the formation of ZSM-48 zeolite. Only when the ratio in gel was above 200, could pure ZSM-48 zeolite be formed. All their observed X-ray powder lines were consistent with the X-ray powder pattern of ZSM-48 free from impurities [21], although the relative peak intensities were different. When the ratio dropped below 200, such as 150, ZSM-22 with some amount of tridymite were obtained. The bulk Si/Al ratio of the crystallized ZSM-48 zeolites was measured by XRF and listed in Table 1. The bulk Si/Al ratio was much smaller than that of the initial gel, showing that Al was probably much easier to be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-48 than Si during synthesis.
The SEM images of the ZSM-48 zeolites are shown in Fig. 2. All three samples were well crystallized with the absence of amorphous materials, exhibiting a discrete rod-like (or needlelike) morphology, similar to the morphology of siliceous ZSM-48 described by Chu [19]. The individual rods of HZSM-48(130) and HZSM-48(160) are about 8 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter while the rods of HZSM-48(220) are about 3 mm  1 mm.

732 Fig. 3 depicts the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the ZSM-48 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios. An intense signal at 54 ppm assigned to 4-coordinated aluminum in the zeolite framework and a very weak one at 0 ppm from extra-framework 6-coordinated aluminum is observed, indicating that the majority of the Al species has been incorporated into the framework of ZSM-48.
3.2. Acidity measurements
The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts was investigated by the NH3-TPD method, and the results are summarized in Table 2. There are evidently two desorption peaks on the TPD profiles of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) catalysts (not shown here). The low and high temperature peaks at about 245 8C and 426 8C correspond to the weak and strong acid sites of the samples,respectively. The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support. Similar phenomenon was observed on the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts [10,11].
The acidity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of supported HZSM-5. As described in Table 2,the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalyst is quite similar to that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much weaker in comparison with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5.
The catalytic activities of different supported Ga2O3 catalysts toward cumene cracking, a typical strong acid catalyzed reaction,have been investigated. The results are also listed in Table 2. The activity of the HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreased sharply with the increase of Si/Al ratio of the support, which is in agreement with NH3-TPD results. The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much lower than that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio,which also indicates the weaker acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts.
3.3. Catalytic performance
Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was carried out at 600 8C over various HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts. The results are given in Fig. 4 and Table 3. The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases while the initial propene selectivity increases. As a consequence, the initial propylene yield has the sequence of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) > Ga2O3/HZSM- 48(160) > Ga2O3/HZSM-48(220). The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al Table 1 Influence of composition of reactant mixture on the products.

733 ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7].
However, the selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization. Fig. 5 exhibits the variation of the propene selectivities over Ga2O3/HZSM-48 and Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts as a function of the propane conversion.
The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller.
3.4. Stability and deactivation of the catalysts
The dehydrogenation reaction has been run continuously on Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) catalyst for 50 h and the results are shown in Fig. 6, together with those of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) for comparison.
Both catalysts deactivate during the reaction, but the deactivation rates are quite different. Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) deactivates slowly and the propane conversion and the propene yield remain stable after 50 h. While for Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130), the reduction in the propane conversion and the propene yield is very small during the first 10 h, and then becomes more abruptly afterwards.
The propane dehydrogenation reaction is thought to be accompanied by various side reactions, comprising essentially the cracking of propane to lower hydrocarbons and the formation of dehydrogenated carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface.
The coke formation leads to the deactivation of the catalyst [22].
The differences in deactivation between Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) could be caused by different coke amount deposited on the catalysts. Results from TG characterization of the spent catalysts show that the coke amount deposited is 2.86 wt% Fig. 4.

734 and 1.79 wt% on Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200),respectively. The higher coke amount on Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) is due to its more acid sites on the surface. The result was parallel with our previous work which showed the acid sites with weak strength would also accelerate the catalyst deactivation though they had little effect on the dehydrogenation reaction [23].
The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions. Table 4 shows the textural properties of the fresh and spent catalysts. The reduction in surface area and micropore volume is more serious on Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130).
3.5. The effect of CO2
The effect of CO2 addition on the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3/HMZSM-48(130) catalyst was also investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The promoting effect of CO2 on the reaction is evident, which is different from that over Ga2O3/HZSM- 5 catalysts [10]. The initial propane conversion increases a little after the introduction of CO2, while the initial propene yield decreases because of the reduction of propene selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved after the addition of CO2.
This improvement can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation coming from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and promotion of desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface, which are similar as that over Ga2O3/ HZSM-5 catalysts [8,10].
4. Conclusions
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 was carried out over HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts. The initial activity of supported catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-48, while the propene selectivity shows an opposite tendency. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 shows the best propene yield of 22.2%. The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity. However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure.
