The exploration of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis reveals a complex interplay between structure, properties, and performance. Different polymorphs exhibit distinct catalytic activities and selectivities, which can be attributed to their unique structural characteristics and surface properties. For instance, the β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its high surface area and abundance of acidic sites, shows superior catalytic performance compared to other forms. The γ-Ga2O3, on the other hand, presents a different set of active sites, influencing the reaction mechanism and selectivity. Understanding these relationships is crucial for the rational design of Ga2O3-based catalysts, as it allows for the optimization of specific properties to enhance catalytic activity and control product distribution. By investigating the influence of structural characteristics and surface properties, researchers can tailor the polymorphs to meet the demands of CO2-ODHP catalysis, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic systems.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
The structure-property-performance relationships of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis have been elucidated, revealing the pivotal role of structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites in determining catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outshine α- and δ-Ga2O3 in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, with surface acidity density decreasing in the order of β > γ > δ > α, mirroring the surface basicity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. The initial activity is contingent on surface acid density, peaking on β-Ga2O3 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, acting as Lewis acid sites, while α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, with weaker acidity \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might generate surface Lewis acid sites, explaining the activity trend \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. However, surface base site density correlates with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. The reduction of Ga cations benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\]. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_4\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The insights into the structure-property-performance relationships of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis open avenues for the design of novel catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. Future research might focus on the controlled synthesis of Ga2O3 polymorphs with tailored surface properties and Lewis acid sites, aiming to maximize C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. The development of advanced characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the dynamic changes in surface properties under reaction conditions. Moreover, the exploration of synergistic effects between Ga2O3 and other metal oxides might lead to the discovery of new catalysts with improved stability and activity. The understanding of the role of surface basic sites in the initial period of the reaction suggests the potential of modifying the surface chemistry to enhance the promotional effect on activity. The investigation of the redox properties of Ga cations and their influence on the reaction mechanism at different stages could provide guidelines for the design of catalysts with optimized performance over the entire reaction period.
