The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\].

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new Ga2O3 polymorphs with enhanced surface acidity and basicity to improve CO2 adsorption and activation. The investigation of the role of surface defects and their impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity could also be a promising direction. Moreover, the study of the redox properties of Ga cations and their influence on the reaction mechanism at different stages could provide insights into the design of more efficient catalysts.
