                The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new Ga2O3 polymorphs with enhanced surface acidity and basicity to improve CO2 adsorption and activation. The investigation of the role of surface defects and their impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity could also be a promising direction. Moreover, the study of the redox properties of Ga cations and their influence on the reaction mechanism at different stages could provide insights into the design of more efficient catalysts. The exploration of alternative synthesis methods to control the polymorphic form and surface properties of Ga2O3 could also be a fruitful area of research. Developing a deeper understanding of the structure-property-performance relationships in Ga2O3 polymorphs could pave the way for the design of novel catalysts with improved stability and activity for propane dehydrogenation.

                不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特性、表面性质和Lewis酸位点的显著影响\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]。β-和γ-Ga2O3相比α-和δ-Ga2O3表现出更高的C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性。表面酸度密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，与表面碱性相吻合。初始活性依赖于表面酸度密度，并在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga离子，这些是配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，充当Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3由八面体Ga3+构成，这些位点的配位更多，酸性较弱。从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重构可能会发生，生成表面Lewis酸位点。Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。表面碱性位点对于CO2吸附和活化来说太少，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱位密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga离子的还原仅在反应初期对DHP有利。在稳态下，反应被提议通过在Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，无需红ox循环\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]。
