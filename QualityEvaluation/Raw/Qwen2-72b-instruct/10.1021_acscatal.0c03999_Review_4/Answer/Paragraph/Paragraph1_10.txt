The exploration of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis reveals a complex interplay between structure, properties, and performance. Different polymorphs exhibit distinct catalytic activities and selectivities, which can be attributed to their unique structural characteristics and surface properties. For instance, the β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its high surface area and abundance of acidic sites, shows superior catalytic performance compared to other forms. The γ-Ga2O3, on the other hand, presents a different set of active sites, influencing the reaction mechanism and selectivity. Understanding these relationships is crucial for the rational design of Ga2O3-based catalysts, as it allows for the optimization of specific properties to enhance catalytic activity and control product distribution. By investigating the influence of structural characteristics and surface properties, researchers can tailor the polymorphs to meet the demands of CO2-ODHP catalysis, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic systems.
