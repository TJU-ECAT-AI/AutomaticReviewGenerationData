          The document acknowledges the potential of gallium oxides as promising materials for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their superior catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere. The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly dependent on the surface area of Ga2O3 among different polymorphs. The total acidity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 samples is approximately 1-2 times higher than that of conventional β-Ga2O3, attributed to a higher density of surface defects due to decreased crystallinity and structural modification. The catalytic performance shows a strong correlation with surface acidity data, indicating that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is key to achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts. Developing new improved catalytic systems with desirable stability and activity remains a significant challenge.

          文件承认镓氧化物作为丙烷脱氢(PDH)的有希望的材料的潜力，因为它们与传统的Cr-或V-基系统相比具有优越的催化效率。表面配位不饱和(Ga3+)位点的独特结构特征对于CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。催化相关的(cus)Ga物种的数量在不同的Ga2O3多晶型中与Ga2O3的表面积密切相关。四种蔗糖衍生Ga2O3样品的总酸度大约是传统β-Ga2O3的1-2倍，这可归因于结晶度降低和结构修改导致的表面缺陷密度增加。催化性能与表面酸度数据表现出极好的相关性，表明高丰度的表面Lewis酸Ga位点是实现蔗糖衍生Ga2O3催化剂高催化活性的关键因素。开发新的改进的催化系统，表现出理想的稳定性和活性，仍然是一个主要挑战。
