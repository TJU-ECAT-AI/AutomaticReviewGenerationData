The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

The document acknowledges the potential of gallium oxides as promising materials for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their superior catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. The unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere. The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly dependent on the surface area of Ga2O3 among different polymorphs. The total acidity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 samples is approximately 1-2 times higher than that of conventional β-Ga2O3, attributed to a higher density of surface defects due to decreased crystallinity and structural modification. The catalytic performance shows a strong correlation with surface acidity data, indicating that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is key to achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts. Developing new improved catalytic systems with desirable stability and activity remains a significant challenge.
