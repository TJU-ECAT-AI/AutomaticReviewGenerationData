Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS),which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2). The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%). 10 Moreover, propylene selectivity over GA-HS catalyst was higher than that over other catalysts in a period of 9 h reaction. These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques. The characterization data indicated that hydrothermal treatment increased the surface area, expanded the pore size and promoted the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and generation of more medium-strong 15 Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, this catalyst mainly displayed amorphous sponge-like morphology as well as a new morphology that some pieces were covered with amorphous nanoparticles. The superior activity of GA-HS was attributed to higher surface area of this catalyst and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+ δ< 2) related to medium-strong Lewis acid sites.
1. Introduction
20 At present, urgent demand of propylene has drawn academic and industrial sectors attention to deeply investigating the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, for it represents a way in which more expensive alkenes can be produced economically from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.1,2 However, the 25 dehydrogenation of propane has inherent disadvantages such as thermodynamic limitations for propane conversion, high energy requirements ascribed to endothermic reaction and limited catalytic stability in virtue of coke formation, etc.3, 4 Recently,oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen as an 30 alternative process for propylene production offers a new promising technology in term of its energy-saving. By using oxygen as oxidant, the dehydrogenation can be proceeded well,but dramatic decrease of propylene selectivity due to excessive propane oxidation is still a problem.2 Considering that, CO2 as a 35 mild oxidant is used to develop a safer and more economical process for propane dehydrogenation.5-7 With introduction of CO2, the dehydrogenation efficiency is increased because of the new additional production process of propylene: a direct surface redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by 40 propane) and reoxidation (by carbon dioxide) cycles8-10 or a more complex reaction pathway involving a simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.11-13 Ga2O3-containg catalysts have been considered for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to their relatively good 45 catalytic performance.14-34 This was verified by Nakagawa et al.35 According to their result, the commercial Ga2O3 showed higher activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2, compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts.
Zheng et al.36 investigated dehydrogenation of propane to 50 propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide. The 55 optimal propane conversion and  propylene selectivity could achieve to 23% and 95% respectively, at 500 C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio = 2:1) and flow rate of 3 L g-1 h-1.Based on that, supported gallium oxide catalysts (Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/SiO2, Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/MgO) were 60 also used for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 by Bingjun Xu et al.37 It was found that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3,and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed a stronger ability for the dehydrogenation of propane than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO,due to the abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites on these 65 catalysts surface and special interactions between the support and Ga2O3. Ga2O3/TiO2 showed the highest activity, and the propane conversion over this catalyst highly achieved to 39% at 600 C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio= 2:1) and flow rate of 6 L g-1 h-1. Michorczyk et al.30 prepared ordered 70 mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2. Over the most active materials, propylene was 75 Page 1 of 12 Catalysis Science & Technology Catalysis Science & Technology Accepted Manuscript Published on 09 March 2016.

2   Catal. Sci. Technol. [2015], [vol], 0000 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry [2015] produced with the yield of 10-18% and high selectivity of 91-95% during 4 h on stream at 550 C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio= 5:1) and flow rate of 9 L g-1 h-1. Moreover, Chen et al.11, 12 studied the effect of preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts 5 for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby 10 leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2. It was found that the initial conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene over Ga8Al2O15 were 49.7% and 91.7% respectively, at 500 C with feed gas mixture (CO2/C3H8 molar ratio = 2:1) and flow rate of 3 L g-1 h-1. For the sake of deeply 15 understanding this reaction, many researchers36-38 drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3- containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low- coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga 20 species,36, 37 and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl- Ga species. Specifically speaking, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong 25 polarizability of the CH bonds resulted from perturbation of propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites.39 Its obvious that more active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by getting a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts. 30 In this work, a facile hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst for DHP-CO2. The as- prepared catalyst displayed better catalytic performance than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method. We have in-detail rationalized the results by various 35 characterizations such as N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TEM, TGA, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques, and aimed to unveil the correlations between the structure and physical properties of Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst and its activity for propane 40 dehydrogenation
2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation
Herein, Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts as well as the simple oxide of Ga2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared using different methods as 45 follows.
Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can be obtained from Ga(NO3)3 and Al(NO3)3 respectively through the  same treatment of drying at 120 C for 8 h in constant temperature oven and subsequent calcinations at 550 C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 C 50 at a ramp rate of 3 C/min) under static air in a muffle oven.
Grind-mixture method: 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1:2) as the precursors were firstly mixed and ground, followed by drying at 120 C for 8 h in constant temperature oven. The resulting mixture was heated to 550 C 55 from room temperature at a ramp rate of 3 C/min, and kept for 5 h under static air in a muffle oven, the catalyst was obtained and defined as GA-GM.
Coprecipitation method: the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst was prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway.40 In a 60 typical synthesis, 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1:2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. Then,40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) was added dropwise to above ethanol solution. The resulting suspension was filtrated and washed by ethanol. After that, the cake was dried at 65 120 C for 8 h in constant temperature oven, followed by calcination at 550 C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 C at a ramp rate of 3 C/min). The obtained catalyst was defined as
GA-CP.
Hydrothermal synthesis method: 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 70 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1:2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. Then, 40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) was added dropwise to above ethanol solution. The resulting suspension was transferred into 200 ml Teflon cup inserted in stainless steel autoclave, then heated to 170 C from room 75 temperature at a ramp rate of 10 C/min and kept for 24 h. After that, the crystalline product was washed repetitively with ethanol,followed by drying at 120 C for 8 h in constant temperature oven, and calcined at 550 C for 5 h under static air like that of coprecipitation method. The obtained catalyst was defined as 80
GA-HS.
Compared with GA-HS, pure Ga (G-HS) and Al (A-HS) were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method. Moreover, Ga2O3-Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar ratios (1:1 and
2:1) were also prepared by grind-mixture method, coprecipitation
85 method and hydrothermal synthesis method, defined as G1A1- GM, G2A1-GM, G1A1-CP, G2A1-CP, G1A1-HS and G2A1-HS respectively.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
The textural properties of catalyst were measured by N2 physical 90 sorption at 77K using a Tristar 3000 machine. Surface areas were calculated by the BET method and micro-, meso-, and macropore volumes were calculated by the t-plot method.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer using CuKα 95 radiation. The anode was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The 2θ angles were scanned from 10 to 70.
Diffuse reflectance infrared spectra (DRIFT) measurements were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with a MCT detector (64 scans, 4 cm1). Simply, 20 mg of catalyst was put it 100 in an infrared cell with KBr windows for in-situ treatments. The DRIFT spectra were recorded after treating the catalyst at 300 C for 1 h with a flow of argon.
Pyridine-adsorbed Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) was used to determine the amount of Brnsted acid 105 sites and Lewis acid sites using Bruker Tensor 27 equipment. 20 mg of catalyst was pressed into a regular wafer (R = 1.3 cm) and then put in an infrared cell. The infrared spectrum was recorded after sample treatment at 400 C for 2 h under vacuum, wherein this spectrum was used as background for the adsorbed pyridine 110 experiments. Pyridine was then adsorbed to a 5.0×10-2 Pa equilibrium pressure at 40 C. FTIR spectra were recorded after consecutive evacuation at 400 C.The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3- Page 2 of 12 Catalysis Science & Technology Catalysis Science & Technology Accepted Manuscript Published on 09 March 2016.

The catalyst (100 mg) was pre-treated at 500 C under a flow of N2 (30 ml/min) for 2 h and then cooled down to 100 C. Then NH3 was introduced into the flow system. 5 The TPD spectra were recorded after about 1h evacuation time until the baseline of TCD signal is steady at a ramp rate of 10 C/min from 100 C to 600 C.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the change of surface composition measured by AXIS ULTRA 10 DLD equipment. The binding energy values were corrected for charging effect by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.5 eV.
The chemical compositions (Al and Ga) of as-prepared samples were determined by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic 15 emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) method using Thermo iCAP 6300 equipment. 71Ga MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra were obtained by a single pulse length of Π/6, and Ga chemical 20 shifts were referenced to Ga(NO3)3. 27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained by a single pulse length of Π/6, and Al chemical shifts were referenced to Al(NO3)3. 25 Transmission electron microscopies (TEM) were performed using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained for morphologic identification using a JSM-7001F.
Pulsed reaction technique was used to measure the activities 30 of these catalysts and carried out on chemisorption instrument (TP-5080) and OMNI star. Transient responses of m/z = 44 (C3H8 and CO2) and m/z = 44, 43 (C3H8) over as-prepared catalysts was tested by an on-line mass spectrometer against a pulsed introduction of C3H8 under steady flow of mixture gas (10% CO2 35 and 90% Ar). Reaction conditions: catalyst = 100 mg; CO2 and Ar carrier = 30 mlmin-1; C3H8 = 1 ml; furnace temperature = 550C.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Rigaku TG analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction. 10 mg of sample was heated 40 from room temperature to 800 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min in flowing air.
2.3 Catalyst evaluation
The catalyst test was carried out in a horizontal quartz tube fixed- bed reactor. Reaction conditions: T = 550 C; P = 100 kPa; mcat. = 45 150 mg; the feed gas mixture C3H8/CO2/N2 with the molar ratio of 1:3:27; total flow rate = 15 cm3·min1.
The products were analysed by off-line gas chromatograph (HUAAI GC 9560) equipped with a FID with Al2O3 packed column, and offline gas chromatograph (East & West GC 4000A) 50 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with carbon molecular sieves packed column, respectively. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated using the following eqs (1) and (2).

3.1 Catalyst test
The conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene over these as-prepared samples as a function of time on stream are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with single Al2O3, the activity of Ga2O3-containg catalysts are remarkably superior for propane 70 dehydrogenation (Fig. 1A), indicating that the presence of Ga species is necessary to generate active sites for propane dehydrogenation.35 Especially on GA-HS, the initial propane conversion is the highest (35.2%), which is much higher than that on Ga2O3 (5.7%), GA-GM (8.7%) and GA-CP (26.2%). From 75 Fig. 1B, it is noticeable that propylene selectivity over these Ga2O3-containing catalysts achieve to about 95.0%, which are obviously higher than that on single Al2O3 (only 73.2%).
Propylene selectivity over Ga2O3 and GA-GM decrease by 13.7% and 26.5 % respectively after 9 h reaction, while that over GA- 80 HS and GA-CP almost remain unchanged during the running period accompanied by the decline of propane conversion.
Seemingly, the propylene selectivity over GA-HS is slightly higher than that over GA-CP. These test results suggest that the activities of Ga2O3-containing catalysts are strongly affected by 85 the preparation method and treatment process. And our adopted hydrothermal synthesis method is remarkably favourable for preparing the catalyst for efficient dehydrogenation of propane, in comparison with the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method. In addition, pure Ga2O3 (G-HS) and Al2O3 (A-HS) are 90 prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method in comparison with GA-HS. The initial propane conversions on G-HS and A-HS are 21.4% and 0.8% (Fig. S1a) respectively, much lower than that on GA-HS, implying that single Ga2O3 or Al2O3 component is indifferent for propane dehydrogenation but their synergistic 95 effect is active due to forming special structure. Besides, the rapid decreases of propylene selectivity on G-HS and A-HS (Fig. S1b) are seen with increase of time on stream in comparison with GA-
HS. Moreover, Ga2O3-Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar
ratios (1:1 and 2:1) are also investigated. From evaluation results 100 of these catalysts, its found that the conversions of propane on the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts are enhanced with the increase of Ga/Al molar ratio (Fig. S1a). Wherein, the Ga2O3-Al2O3 prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method still shows the superior activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 to 105 those catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method and coprecipitation method with the same Ga/Al molar ratio. The propylene selectivity over the hydrothermally prepared catalyst achieves to about 95.0 % during the whole test period like the coprecipitated-prepared catalyst (Fig. S1b), which is higher than 110 Page 3 of 12 Catalysis Science & Technology Catalysis Science & Technology Accepted Manuscript Published on 09 March 2016.

In order to study the effect of CO2 on this reaction, the catalytic tests without CO2 are performed over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts for comparison (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The initial 15 conversions of propane on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts without CO2 are higher than that with CO2, indicating that the presence of carbon dioxide is not positive to promote the dehydrogenation of propane as expected. Xu et al.37 considered that the negative effect was been attributed to the greatly reduced propane 20 adsorption capacity due to the competition of CO2. However,compared with catalytic tests in presence of CO2, rapid deactivation of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of CO2 is observed. And propane conversions on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts testing in presence of CO2 are higher than that in the 25 absence of CO2 after 9 h on stream. It can be indicated that the presence of CO2 is beneficial for improving durability of the catalysts. The enhanced stability of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency.12 In addition, the primary product (propylene) and by- 30 products (methane, ethylene, ethane, etc.) are formed during the dehydrogenation process of propane regardless of the presence of
CO2. However, it is worthy to note that the selectivity to by-
products over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in the absence of CO2. It is thought that CO2 as 35 a mild oxidant can promote the dehydrogenation of propane preferentially and weaken the cracking and hydrocracking reactions somewhat, thereby increasing the selectivity of target product propylene compared with that in absence of CO2. With the observation of higher conversion of CO2 and lower molar 40 ratio H2/CO over GA-HS (Table S1), it can be further confirmed that GA-HS has superior activity to GA-GM and GA-CP in the present reaction. The catalytic tests of GA-HS after regeneration with air or CO2 are performed (Fig. S3). The comparative results of regeneration with O2 and CO2 indicate that both agents are 45 effective in coke removing. But propane conversion and propylene selectivity on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 after 9h reaction on stream are much lower than that with air, implying that the CO2 can partly remove the coke through Boudouard reaction. 37 50 Considering the distinction of test conditions (such as reaction temperature, GHSV and CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of feed gas mixture, etc.), it is difficult to make a certain conclusion that which preparation method is more preferential by comparing the activities of the Ga2O3-containing catalysts prepared by different 55 researchers. But it is widely accepted that the presence of Lewis acid sites related to Ga3+ ions in tetrahedral sites, which is obtained through special treatment process such as hydrothermal synthesis, is favourable for propane dehydrogenation. However,propane conversion and propylene selectivity over GA-HS are 60 higher than that over these catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method at the same test conditions,indicating that the hydrothermal synthesis can improve the activity of Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts greatly. In this work, we focus on the effect of preparation method on the activity of Ga2O3- 65 Al2O3 catalysts for DHP-CO2.
Propane conversions over these Ga2O3-containing samples all decrease as a function of reaction time. Wherein, it is thought that this gradual deactivation of the catalysts is caused by the coke Page 4 of 12 Catalysis Science & Technology Catalysis Science & Technology Accepted Manuscript Published on 09 March 2016.

The weight loss of these spent samples decreases in the order: GA-HS > GA-CP > GA-GM > Ga2O3. Spent GA-HS displays maximum weight loss compared 5 with the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method, demonstrating its high coke performance. Published work19, 30 reported that the high catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials is attributed to the surface gallium sites with Lewis acidity, which are also the coke 10 deposition sites. For the present catalysts, GA-HS should possess more Lewis acid sites than the others based on its relatively good performance (as shown in Fig. 1A). That implies that there are more coke deposition sites existed on GA-HS. Moreover, the initial conversion of propane (Fig. S2) and the initial selectivity 15 of propylene (Table S1) over these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of CO2 are much higher. This result suggests that the concentration of propylene in the absence of CO2 in the initial step is also high. Because the propylene is more reactive than propane, its higher concentration in reaction zone leads probably 20 to higher coke amount, which also contributes to fast deactivation of catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane in terms of substrates-products reactivity.17, 30 Thus, the coke is easily formed on GA-HS catalyst during DHP-CO2 process due to its high activity. In addition, the coke also has significant effects on the 25 durability of these catalysts. As our observation, the propane conversion decrease dramatically with increase of time

In addition, DTA profiles of the spent Ga-containing (Fig. 2B) show that both spent GA-GM and spent Ga2O3 only display one peak at 460 C and 426 C respectively,corresponding to one type of carbon species. But the spent GA- 40 CP shows two peaks at 454 C and 479 C assigned to two different types of carbon species. Spent GA-HS displays a similar DTA profile to the spent GA-CP, but with higher amounts of carbon species. Nevertheless, it deserves further study to understand the details about the mechanism of formation of 45 different carbon species.
3.2 Catalyst composition and textural properties
The pore volume, pore size and BET surface areas (SBET) of different catalysts are obtained based on sorption isotherms of N2 condensation at 77 K. N2-sorption isotherms of these catalysts 50 (Fig. S4) are a type V with a steep increase around P/P0 = 0.4,indicating that these samples belong to typical mesoporous materials.41, 42  From the profiles of pore size distributions in Fig. 3, it can be seen that GA-GM and GA-CP have a very narrow pore size distribution with average pore diameter 7.6 nm and 7.9 55 nm respectively, while GA-HS has a broad pore size distribution with average pore diameter 12.5 nm. This suggests that special pore structure can be produced after the hydrothermal treatment.
The BET surface area and total volumes of the catalysts are calculated and the results are shown in Table 1. The BET surface 60 area and total volumes of GA-HS are 234 m2/g and 0.730 cm3/g respectively, higher than that of GA-GM, GA-CP, pure Ga2O3 and pure Al2O3. In combination with the above test results,

Fig. 4. XRD profiles of as-prepared samples (a) Ga2O3; (b) GA-GM; (c) GA-CP; (d) GA-HS; (e) Al2O3. it is thought that active Ga species can be more easily dipersed on 5 GA-HS due to its high BET surface and volumes than that of GA- GM and GA-CP, thereby leading to its good performance probably. Moreover, the higher micropore surface area and micropore volumes of GA-CP than that of GA-HS and GA-GM means that using a coprecipitation method can lead to the 10 preferential formation of  micropores over GA-CP than other catalysts. Based on the larger number of mes- and macro-pores in GA-HS than GA-CP and GA-GM, the conclusion can be made that hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of mes- and macro-pores over the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst,but the 15 coprecipitation method is in favor of formation of micropores.
To clarify the thermal stability of the catalyst prepared by hydrothermal method, the textural properties of the samples after DHP-CO2 test and regeneration with air have been characterized by low N2 adsorption and the data is listed in Table 2. Compared 20 with the fresh samples, the spent GA-CP and spent GA-HS both show obvious decrease in the SBET (decrease by 96.2 m2/g and
74.0 m2/g) and pore volume (decrease by 0.297 m3/g and 0.543
m3/g) respectively, whereas the spent GA-GM shows some increase in the SBET and pore volume (incease by 33.1 m2/g and 25
0.014 m3/g) due to cumuli of coke deposition. After regeneration
with air, pores of these spent Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts are recovered partly. And the regenerated GA-HS still shows the highest SBET and pore volume among these regenerated samples, indicating that the hydrothermal synthesis method is superior to other 30 preparation methods in this work.
Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts, along with simple Ga2O3 and Al2O3. The diffraction lines of the as-prepared samples are very broad, demonstrating a low crystallinity of all the samples. This low crystallinity is a 35 common feature of metastable γ-variety of both alumina and gallia polymorphs.12 The as-prepared Ga2O3 reveals the typical characteristics of γ-Ga2O3 inferred from the 2θ angles (30.8,
36.2 and 64.2 in curve a) of diffraction peak, while simple
Al2O3 suggests the typical characteristics of γ-Al2O3 based on the 40 2θ angles (45.4, 60.3 and 67.1 in curve e) of the diffraction peak. GA-GM closely resembles γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3 in the light of diffraction maxima (curve b), indicating that no new structures

Yet GA-CP and GA-HS dont exhibit typical characteristics of simple γ-Ga2O3 and/or γ- Al2O3 like GA-GM. d(440) spacing corresponds to cubic lattice parameter a0,  which can be used to distinguish the cubic spinel- type structure (gallia-alumina solid solution) by the location of 55 (440) peak.40 It can be seen that the (440) peaks of γ-Ga2O3 and γ- Al2O3 are located at 64.2 and 67.1 respectively. The (440) peaks of GA-CP and GA-HS lie between that of γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3,indicating that the cubic spinel-type structures are formed on GA- CP and GA-HS.43 In comparison with GA-CP, the (440) peak of 60 GA-HS shifts to high 2θ angle due to preparation method.

This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Catal. Sci. Technol. [2015], [vol], 0000    7 suggests that different structure presents on GA-CP and GA-HS in despite of the presence of similar cubic spinel-type structures on these two catalysts, which results in their activity differences for propane dehydrogenation.
3.3 Coordination state and oxidation state of Ga
5 To reflect the coordination state of Ga3+ ion, the 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift measurements are conducted and the spectra of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The two asymmetric bands within -100 ppm  300 ppm are assigned to tetrahedral Ga (GaT) ions and octahedral Ga (GaO) ions, respectively.14, 40, 44-46 Peak 10 deconvolution of the NMR GaT and GaO bands are also done to provide more information about the Ga distribution (among tetrahedral and octahedral sites) in the structure of these catalysts.
The deconvoluted results in Table 3 suggest that most of Ga ions in GA-GM and Ga2O3 occupy octahedral GaO sites while that in 15 GA-CP and GA-HS are mainly located at tetrahedral GaT sites.
Especially for GA-HS, the GaT ions percent achieves to 85.5%. It indicates that hydrothermal synthesis method promotes the formation of tetrahedral GaT ions. Besides, the content of total GaT ions is also calculated in combination with bulk content of 20 the Ga obtained by ICP-AES. The results show that the content of total GaT ions of GA-HS is higher than GA-GM and GA-CP.
Already published research36,37 indicated that the low- coordinated GaT cations contributed to the activity of Ga2O3- containg catalysts for DHP-CO2. And it is consistent with our 25 results that the content of GaT cations has a positive relationship with activity of Ga2O3-containg catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Propane can heterolytically dissociate on low- coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species as step (3), and the 30 alkoxides then decompose further to the dehydrogenation products as step (4) and (5) as follows:
H-     C3H7
+ Ga3+O2M3+ + C3H8  Ga3+O2M3+  (M = Ga, Al)    (3)
H-    C3H7
+                                      H-         H+ 35 Ga3+O2M3+ + C3H8  Ga3+O2M3+ + C3H6                   (4) and
H-      H+
Ga3+O2M3+ Ga3+O2M3+ + H2                               (5) When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation 40 reaction, chemisorbed H2 generates from the step (5) can be removed via an alternative route as step (6):
H-      H+
Ga3+O2M3+ + CO2  Ga3+O2M3+ + CO + H2O    (6)
45 Its apparent that the more low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites are obtained in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts, the better catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation is. Apart from that, the coordination state of the Al3+ ion is also investigated by 27Al MAS NMR and the results are shown in Fig. S5 and the 50 percentage of Al3+ ions are listed in Table S2. The results suggest that the percentage of Al3+ ion in GA-HS is higher than that in GA-GM and GA-CP, indicating that hydrothermal synthesis

promotes the formation of more tetrahedral AlT ions as well as tetrahedral GaT ions.
XPS is an effective technique to characterize the surface situation of catalysts.47-52 Oxidation states and quantity of the 5 elements that are present within the top 1-12 nm of the sample surface can be obtained by this technique. The surface Ga/Al ratios measured by XPS and the bulk Ga/Al ratios determined by ICP-AES are shown in Table 3. The surface Ga/Al ratio of GA- GM is lower than bulk Ga/Al ratio, while the surface Ga/Al ratios 10 of GA-CP and GA-HS are higher than their bulk Ga/Al ratios.
This indicates that the coprecipitation synthesis and hydrothermal synthesis could make more Ga species expose on the surface of Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts. This is also verified by SEM-EDS results (Fig. S6), which show that the surfaces of GA-CP and GA-HS are 15 remarkably enriched in Ga, compared with GA-GM. The Ga 3d and Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra of these catalysts are displayed in Fig. 6.
From the deconvoluted spectra on the Ga 3d region (Fig. 6A), the observation is that only two peaks appear in the spectra of GA- GM and GA-CP at about 24.1 and 20.6 eV respectively, which 20 are assigned to O2s and Ga3+ 3d bands.53 As for GA-HS, a new and additional low-energy peak at 19.6 eV is found, which can be attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2),21, 54 suggesting that the reduced Ga species are probably generated by the hydrothermal synthesis. This can be further verified by Ga 2p1/2 25 XPS spectra (Fig. 6B).  It can be seen that the GA-CP and GA- GM only show one oxidation state, and Ga 2p1/2 binding energy (BE) value for GA-CP (1144.6 eV) is higher than that for GA- GM (1144.2 eV). While GA-HS show two oxidation states (1144.2 eV and 1147.9 eV, respectively). It is deduced that the 30 other Ga oxidation state (1147.9 eV) ascribed to Gaδ+ species probably is formed on GA-HS, due to the surface enrichment of Ga species and generation of more low-coordinated GaT species by hydrothermal treatment. The dehydrogenation of propane over reducible metal oxide catalysts such as chromium and iron oxides 35 in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism.55 That is, propane is oxidized to propylene with the simultaneous reduction of metal oxide (e.g. Fe2O3, Cr2O3), and subsequently the reduced metal oxide catalyst is reoxidized by
CO2. According to the above results, Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) exist in
40 our prepared GA-HS and the mentioned redox mechanism is probably applicable for the present catalyst system. However,compared that the fresh catalyst, the spent GA-HS with or without CO2 (Fig. S7A) shows two binding energy peaks in Ga 3d XPS spectra at about 24.1 eV and 20.8 eV assigned to O2s and 45 Ga3+ 3d bands respectively, and yet the original low-energy peak at 19.6 eV attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) disappears. It is deduced that these Gaδ+ species have been converted into Ga3+ species probably. This can be also further verified by the disappearance of binding energy peak at 1147.9 50 eV (ascribed to the Ga oxidation state) in Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra (Fig. S7B) after reaction with or without CO2. Compared with fresh GA-HS, oxidation states in the spent GA-HS with CO2 are similar to that without CO2, implying that the redox mechanism in which the CO2 is taken as an oxidant is not available for the 55 present catalyst. However, CO2 still plays a positive role in the enhancement of dehydrogenation activity through reverse water- gas shift reaction and elimination of coke by Boudouard reaction.37 The reduced gallium ions (Gaδ+ species δ< 2) are also thought to have high dehydrogenation efficiency. The gallium- 60 hydrogen bond can be formed on these reduced gallium ions by heterolytic hydrogen dissociation, and can be stabilized on the support surface.21 Therefore, dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of redox mechanism. 65 Wherein, it should be pointed out that the further work needs to be done to clarify the mechanism of conversion of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) to Ga3+ species with and without CO2.
3.4 Morphologies of as-prepared samples
In order to reveal the morphologies of these as-prepared samples,70 TEM is applied and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Al2O3 shows smooth pieces (Fig. 7a) while Ga2O3 takes on an irregular and segregated morphology (Fig. 7b). GA-GM as shown in Fig. 7c mainly contains two kinds of morphologies. Wherein, it is thought that they are ascribed to Ga2O3 and Al2O3 respectively, in 75 combination with Fig. 7a, 7b. While GA-CP (Fig. 7d) just exhibits a unified distinct sponge-like morphology probably ascribed to gallia-alumina solid solution (cubic spinel-type structure) inferred from the XRD results that gallia-alumina solid solution (cubic spinel-type structure) is generated. In case of GA- 80 HS, besides amorphous sponge-like morphology like GA-CP as shown in Fig. 7d, an additional morphology (Fig. 7e) that some pieces are covered with amorphous nanoparticles is also seen.
Furthermore, some amorphous nanoparticles can embed into these pieces (Fig. 7f). Its easily understandable that the distinct 85 multiple morphologies of these samples are ascribed to their different structures, which are determined by preparation method and treatment process.
3.5 Acidity of the catalysts
A comparison of the DRIFT spectra in the OH stretching region 90 for the as-prepared samples is showed in Fig. 8. The stretching band of Ga-OH groups for Ga2O3 and Al-OH for Al2O3 are located at 3650 cm-1 and 3716 cm-1 respectively. As for GA-GM,no any stretching bands of Al-OH groups or Ga-OH groups are observed but only a broad region, probably because of the 95 formation of disordered mixture between Al2O3 and Ga2O3. GA- CP and GA-HS both show a new stretching band of special group at about 3683 cm-1, which is assigned to Ga-OH or Al-OH in the cubic spinel-type structure. The appearance of the new OH group somewhat affects the acidity of catalyst. Based on that, the 100 distribution of acidity on these different catalysts is measured by NH3-TPD and the profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that there is only one NH3 desorption peak over these catalysts. The desorption peak on GA-HS shows an obvious shift to higher temperature (315 C) in comparison with that on GA-GM 105 (284 C) and GA-CP (303 C), meaning that the acidity strength of the GA-HS is enhanced facilely via the hydrothermal synthesis and the medium-strong Lewis acid sites are generated on the catalyst accordingly. Moreover, the increased number of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS, in comparison of GA-CP and GA-GM 110 (Table 3), implies that the hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of medium-strong Lewis acid sites. It has been proved that the dehydrogenation of propane proceeded mainly on the

Lewis acid sites related to low-coordinated Ga3+ ions on Ga2O3 containing catalysts, which affected intensively their activities for dehydrogenation of propane.12, 56 Its apparently plausible that 20 large amount of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS play a key role in improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
Apart from the acidity number and acidity strength of active sites over these catalysts, the acidity type also contributes to their catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. Based on 25 that, FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption on different catalysts are recorded to identify the Brnsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. two peaks, at 1458 cm- 1 and 1620 cm-1 respectively, appear over all these catalysts,which are assigned to Lewis acid sites.44, 57 Thats to say, only 30 Lewis acid sites exist on these Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts. In view of NH3-TPD profiles, it is deduced that the desorbed NH3 arise from Lewis acid sites. And these Lewis acid sites are related to coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ ions in the tetrahedral position.57 Its apparent that GA-HS possesses more Ga3+ ions in the 35 tetrahedral sites than GA-GM and GA-CP because of more number of Lewis acid sites on GA-HS inferred from by NH3-TPD,thereby showing better catalytic performance substantially. This result is consistent with the NMR results.Chen et al.11, 12 reported that surface acidity (specifically 40 Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts is crucial to obtain high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. Wherein, the surface acidity is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. Therefore, the investigation to surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is helpful to understand the propane 45 dehydrogenation in-deep. As proposed, propane activation firstly Page 9 of 12 Catalysis Science & Technology Catalysis Science & Technology Accepted Manuscript Published on 09 March 2016.

10   Catal. Sci. Technol. [2015], [vol], 0000 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry [2015] proceeds on these low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl- Ga species, and then the dehydrogenation products are generated by subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species.
In our work, a positive correlation between the number of Ga species in tetrahedral sites and the number of surface Lewis acid 5 sites on GA-HS further verifies the previous work.12
3.6 Pulsed reaction
To gain more insight into the mechanism of DHP-CO2 over the different catalysts, a pulsed reaction technique is used to measure the activities of these catalysts.13 The transient responses over as- 10 prepared catalysts against a pulsed introduction of C3H8 at 550C under steady flow of mixture gas (10% CO2 and 90% Ar) are tested by an on-line mass spectrometer as well as the contrast tests, and the results are shown in Fig. 11.  When C3H8 is pulsely introduced under steady flow of pure Ar, similar narrow and 15 positive peaks with the transient response of m/z= 44 (C3H8) over all these catalysts (Fig. S8) can be seen. Besides, the transient response of m/z= 43 determined as C3H8 also can be noticed.58, 59 When steady flow is introduced with 10% CO2, the peak responses of m/z = 43 and m/z = 44 over theses catalysts are 20 obviously different. The transient response of m/z= 43 over GA- GM, GA-CP and GA-HS are all similar and present as narrow peaks (Fig. S9), suggesting that C3H8 is detected over these catalysts.. In case of the responses of m/z = 44 over GA-HS, the inverted peaks apparently indicate that the introduced C3H8 and 25 CO2 has been consumed greatly (Fig. 11c). Whereas, the narrow and positive peaks of GA-CP imply that the remarkable amount of C3H8 feedstock is still reserved (Fig. 11b). The largest broad and positive peaks of the transient response (m/z = 44) over GA- GM (Fig. 11a), indicate the weak conversion of C3H8. 30 Conclusively, the above results suggest that activity of GA-HS for DHP-CO2 is higher than that over other catalysts, which agrees with the previous test results.
Reported work60-63 has shown that hydrothermal conditions (generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time) had 35 great influence on the crystallization and formation process of the catalysts. In this work, the characterization data suggested that hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure,hydrothermal temperature and time (170 C for 24 h) played significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of 40 surface gallium sites. Through the hydrothermal process, more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites gallium sites were exposed on the surface of GA-HS, thus contributing to formation of surface Lewis acid sites.
Moreover, this hydrothermal treatment is also favorable for improving surface area and increasing pore volume of the 45 catalyst. Its the superior structure and physical properties obtained by hydrothermal synthesis that ultimately result in high activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, it can be concluded apparently that hydrothermal synthesis is quite an effective method to obtain an efficient Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst for 50 propane dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusion remarks
A Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS) prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method showed prominent activity for the DHP-CO2.
The highest propane conversion achieved on GA-HS catalyst was 55
35.2%, which was much higher than that of GA-GM (8.7%)
prepared using grind-mixture method and GA-CP (26.2%) prepared using coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity over GA-HS was highest among these catalysts during the whole reaction time. On the other hand,60 propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of time on stream on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 are some low in comparison with that on fresh GA-HS, implying that the coke can be partly eliminated with CO2 through Boudouard reaction.
Besides, the introduction of CO2 to this reaction system improved 65 durability of the catalysts in spite of the decreased initial conversions of propane on these Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts.
Characterization results such as BET, XPS, etc. suggested that hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure,hydrothermal temperature and time (170 C for 24 h) played 70 significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites. This process made more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites expose on the surface of GA-HS, which contributed to formation of surface Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the hydrothermal treatment is favorable for improving surface area 75 and increasing pore volume of the catalyst. The texture of GA-HS was largely recovered with air regeneration even after 9 h reaction time well. Higher surface area and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to strong Lewis acid sites were responsible for the superior activity of GA- 80 HS catalyst. The correlative work about generation and effect of Gaδ+ ions are still on-going.
