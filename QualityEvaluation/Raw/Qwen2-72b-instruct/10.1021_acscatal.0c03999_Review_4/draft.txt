1. The structure-property-performance relationships of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis: Investigating the influence of structural characteristics, surface properties, and reaction mechanisms on catalytic activity and selectivity

        The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, correlating with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new Ga2O3 polymorphs with enhanced surface properties, aiming to increase the density of Lewis acid sites while maintaining high surface basicity for improved CO2 adsorption and activation. Additionally, the investigation of the role of surface defects and their impact on catalytic activity could provide insights into the design of more efficient catalysts. The exploration of redox-active promoters that can stabilize the Ga cations in their reduced state might also be a promising direction to enhance the initial activity and prolong the catalytic lifetime. Moreover, the study of the dynamic changes in surface properties under reaction conditions could offer a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and guide the rational design of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
