<questions>

How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
[2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
[3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
[4] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
[5] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
[6] "Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend."
[7] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
[8] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."
[9] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
[10] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

1.不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其结构特性、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）和Lewis酸位点的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸度密度的顺序为β > γ > δ > α，这与表面碱性相吻合。初始活性依赖于表面酸密度，并在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga离子，这些是配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，作为Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3由八面体Ga3+构成，这些位点更配位，酸性较弱。从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重构可能会发生，生成表面Lewis酸位点。Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。表面碱性位点太少，无法吸附和活化CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱位密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期具有促进作用。Ga2O3的还原性较弱（新鲜Ga2O3的15 mol%），催化剂中存在Ga+和Ga3+（XPS），可以推测Ga离子的还原发生在反应的初始阶段，仅对DHP有益。在稳态下，反应被提议通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，无需红ox循环。
