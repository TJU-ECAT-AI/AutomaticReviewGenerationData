1.The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, and the surface basicity follows the same trend. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest activity. β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

1.不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其结构特性、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）和Lewis酸位点的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸度密度的顺序为β > γ > δ > α，表面碱度也遵循相同的趋势。初始活性依赖于表面酸度密度，β-Ga2O3表现出最高的活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga离子，这些是配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，作为Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3由八面体Ga3+构成，这些位点更配位，酸性较弱。从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重构可能会发生，生成表面Lewis酸位点。Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。表面碱性位点对于CO2吸附和活化来说太少，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱位密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期具有促进作用。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。
