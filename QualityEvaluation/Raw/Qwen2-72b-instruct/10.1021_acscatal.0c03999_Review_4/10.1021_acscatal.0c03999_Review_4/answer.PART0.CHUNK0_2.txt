1.The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. β- and γ-Ga2O3 show higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, while α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

1.不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）和Lewis酸位点的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3相比α-和δ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现更优。表面酸度密度的顺序为β > γ > δ > α，这与表面碱性相吻合。初始活性依赖于表面酸度密度，并在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga阳离子，这些是配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，而α-和δ-Ga2O3由八面体Ga3+构成，这些位点的配位更强，酸性较弱。从八面体到四面体Ga阳离子的重构可能会发生，生成表面Lewis酸位点。Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。另一方面，表面碱性位点对于CO2吸附和活化来说太少了，因此导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期具有促进作用。在稳态下，反应被提议通过在Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而无需红ox循环。
