          [1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
          [2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
          [3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
          [4] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
          [5] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
          [6] "Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend."
          [7] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
          [8] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."
          [9] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
          [10] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

          The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. β- and γ-Ga2O3 exhibit higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and is maximized on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites and act as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated and have weaker acidity. The reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. Surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. However, the surface base site density shows a correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of the reaction. The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

          不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）和Lewis酸位点的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸度密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，与表面碱性密度一致。初始活性依赖于表面酸度密度，并在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。β-和γ-Ga2O3都含有四面体Ga阳离子，这些阳离子是配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，充当Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3由八面体Ga3+构成，这些Ga3+的配位更多，酸性较弱。从八面体到四面体Ga阳离子的重构可能会发生，生成表面Lewis酸位点。Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。另一方面，表面碱性位点太少，无法吸附和活化CO2，因此CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期具有促进作用。结合Ga2O3的弱还原性（新鲜Ga2O3的15 mol%）和催化剂中Ga+和Ga3+的存在（XPS），可以推测Ga阳离子的还原发生在反应的初始阶段，仅对DHP有益。在稳态下，反应被提议通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。
