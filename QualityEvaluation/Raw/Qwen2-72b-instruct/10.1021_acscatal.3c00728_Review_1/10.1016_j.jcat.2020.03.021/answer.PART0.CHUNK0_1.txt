1.The literature does not provide information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is correlated with the activity for propane ODH. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
