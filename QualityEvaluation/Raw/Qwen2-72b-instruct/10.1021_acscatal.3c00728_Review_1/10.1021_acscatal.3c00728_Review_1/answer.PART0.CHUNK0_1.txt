[1] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
[2] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
[3] "Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."
[4] "In 2016, Hermanss group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "Although the product distribution of h-BN and BNNTs was similar, BNNTs exhibited more than 1 order of magnitude higher mass-specific propane consumption rate (molC3H8·kgcat-1·s1) than h-BN."
[6] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."
[7] "Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction."
[8] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane."
[9] "The generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>NOCH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene."
[10] "The catalytic effects of different kinds of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, B atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) of BN, on ODHP were also explored by researchers using DFT."
[11] "The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges."
[12] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
[13] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions."
[14] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[15] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
[16] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."
[17] "Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets and are also found in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites exhibit higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs showing a higher mass-specific propane consumption rate than h-BN. The theory of 1-D edge active sites explains the behavior of 2-D boron materials, with oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN proposed as active sites for ODHP. DFT calculations reveal that the reaction begins with hydrogen abstraction from propane, leading to the formation of surface-stabilized propyl intermediates and the subsequent production of propene. Different 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, zigzag B-terminated, and nitride-terminated edges, have been explored, with the zigzag B-terminated edge being more active. Challenges with 1-D active sites include the need for activation, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues. Strategies to address these challenges include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be improved by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which enhances the interlayer force of h-BN and weakens the affinity of BN bonds to oxygen.

1.硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D））对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为一维、二维和三维配置。1-D活性位点线性分布在二维六方氮化硼（h-BN）片层的边缘，也存在于硼氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）中。这些1-D活性位点对丙烯表现出更高的选择性，与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比，BNNTs的丙烷消耗率比h-BN高一个数量级。1-D边缘活性位点理论解释了2-D硼材料的行为，提出了氧终止的BN的扶手椅边缘作为ODHP的活性位点。DFT计算显示，反应从丙烷中提取氢开始，导致表面稳定丙基中间体的形成和随后的丙烯生产。不同的1-D B基边缘活性位点，包括扶手椅、B-终止的锯齿状和氮终止的锯齿状边缘，已被探索，锯齿状B-终止边缘更活跃。1-D活性位点的挑战包括需要激活、边缘活性位点密度低和稳定性问题。解决这些挑战的策略包括预氧改性以减少诱导期，减小BN纳米片的尺寸以增加边缘与表面的比例，以及将活性成分聚集到1-D形状的材料中。1-D分散活性位点的稳定性可以通过设计复合催化剂（如h-BNxIn2O3）来提高，这增强了h-BN的层间力，削弱了BN键对氧的亲和力。
