[1] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
[2] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
[3] "Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."
[4] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."
[5] "The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges."
[6] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
[7] "Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."
[8] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[9] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
[10] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) types. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets or in BN nanotubes, which are curled BN layers. The theory of 1-D edge active sites helps explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. Oxygen atoms tend to adsorb dissociatively, leading to irreversible oxygen functionalization of fresh edges. The zig-B edge is more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site based on kinetics and thermodynamics. Propane dehydrogenation is more likely to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites than CC bond cleavage side reactions. Preoxygen modification of edge sites can improve ODHP performance and reduce the induction period. Reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio can enhance the density of edge sites. Aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials strengthens BN catalysts. For the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed, which contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D））对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有重大影响。活性位点可以分为一维、二维和三维类型。1-D活性位点线性分布在2-D h-BN片层的边缘，或在BN纳米管中，后者是卷曲的BN层。1-D边缘活性位点的理论有助于解释2-D硼材料的行为。氧原子倾向于以解离方式吸附，而不是以分子氧的形式吸附，导致新鲜边缘的不可逆氧功能化。基于动力学和热力学，zig-B边缘比扶手椅或zig-N边缘位点更活跃。丙烷脱氢在氧改性的边缘位点上比CC键断裂的副反应更容易发生。边缘位点的预氧改性被证明能有效提高ODHP性能并缩短诱导期。为了提高边缘位点的密度，一种有效的策略是减小BN纳米片的尺寸并增加边缘/表面比。将活性成分聚集到1-D形状的材料中可以增强BN催化剂。为了1-D分散活性位点的稳定性，设计了一种h-BNxIn2O3复合催化剂，这有助于设计更有效的催化剂以用于商业应用。
