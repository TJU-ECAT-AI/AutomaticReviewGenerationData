[1] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
[2] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
[3] "Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."
[4] "In 2016, Hermanss group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."
[6] "The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges."
[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
[8] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[9] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
[10] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) types. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets or on the surface of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites exhibit higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. The theory of 1-D edge active sites helps explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials in ODHP reactions. Oxygen atoms tend to adsorb dissociatively on these edges, leading to irreversible oxygen functionalization. Among the different types of 1-D B-based edge active sites, the zig-B edge is more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site. Strategies to improve the performance of 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. For stability, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed, which extends the catalytic stability of h-BN. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in ODHP.

1.硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D））对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为一维、二维和三维类型。1-D活性位点线性分布在二维六方氮化硼（h-BN）片层的边缘或氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）的表面。这些1-D活性位点在选择性上优于传统的金属氧化物催化剂。1-D边缘活性位点的理论有助于解释2-D硼材料在ODHP反应中的行为。氧原子倾向于在这些边缘上以解离方式吸附，导致新鲜边缘的不可逆氧官能化。在不同类型的1-D B基边缘活性位点中，zig-B边缘比armchair或zig-N边缘位点更活跃。提高1-D BN边缘活性位点性能的策略包括预氧改性以减少诱导期，减小BN纳米片的尺寸以增加边缘/表面比，以及将活性组分聚集到1-D形状的材料中。为了提高稳定性，设计了h-BNxIn2O3复合催化剂，这延长了h-BN的催化稳定性。理解这些位点，特别是1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，对设计更高效的催化剂以应用于商业ODHP具有贡献。
