          [1] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
          [2] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
          [3] "Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."
          [4] "In 2016, Hermanss group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts."
          [5] "Although the product distribution of h-BN and BNNTs was similar, BNNTs exhibited more than 1 order of magnitude higher mass-specific propane consumption rate (molC3H8·kgcat-1·s1) than h-BN."
          [6] "The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP."
          [7] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."
          [8] "A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."
          [9] "Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction."
          [10] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane."
          [11] "The generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>NOCH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene."
          [12] "The catalytic effects of different kinds of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, B atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) of BN, on ODHP were also explored by researchers using DFT."
          [13] "The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges."
          [14] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
          [15] "Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."
          [16] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions."
          [17] "First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition."
          [18] "Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts."
          [19] "Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."
          [20] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
          [21] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
          [22] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."
          [23] "Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed."
          [24] "The strong metal oxidesupport interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the BN bond to O·."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites have been found to offer higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs exhibiting higher mass-specific propane consumption rates than h-BN. The high reactivity, selectivity, and stability of BN materials have led to enhanced propene productivity, making them attractive for commercial implementation in ODHP processes. The reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen from propane, followed by the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to form propene. Different types of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, zigzag B-terminated, and zigzag nitride-terminated edges, have been explored, with the zigzag B-terminated edge being more active. Strategies to improve the performance of 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing the edge density by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which can extend catalytic stability.

          硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D））对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为一维、二维和三维配置。1-D活性位点线性分布在二维六方氮化硼（h-BN）片层的边缘或硼氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）中。这些1-D活性位点被发现对丙烯具有更高的选择性，与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比，BNNTs的丙烷消耗率比h-BN高一个数量级以上。BN材料的高反应性、选择性和稳定性导致丙烯生产力显著提高，使其成为ODHP过程商业应用的有吸引力的选择。反应机制涉及从丙烷中抽氢，随后形成表面稳定的丙基中间体和随后的自由基反弹形成丙烯。探索了不同类型的1-D B基边缘活性位点，包括扶手椅型、B终止的锯齿型和氮终止的锯齿型边缘，其中B终止的锯齿型边缘更活跃。提高1-D BN边缘活性位点性能的策略包括预氧改性以减少诱导期，通过减小BN纳米片的尺寸来增加边缘密度，以及将活性成分聚集到1-D形状的材料中。通过设计复合催化剂，如h-BNxIn2O3，可以增强1-D分散活性位点的稳定性，从而延长催化稳定性。
