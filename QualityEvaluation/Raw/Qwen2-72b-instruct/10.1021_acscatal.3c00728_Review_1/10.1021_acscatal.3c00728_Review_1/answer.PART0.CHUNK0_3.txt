[1] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
[2] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
[3] "Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."
[4] "In 2016, Hermanss group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "Although the product distribution of h-BN and BNNTs was similar, BNNTs exhibited more than 1 order of magnitude higher mass-specific propane consumption rate (molC3H8·kgcat-1·s1) than h-BN."
[6] "The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP."
[7] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."
[8] "A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."
[9] "Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction."
[10] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane."
[11] "The generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>NOCH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene."
[12] "The catalytic effects of different kinds of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, B atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) of BN, on ODHP were also explored by researchers using DFT."
[13] "The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges."
[14] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
[15] "Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."
[16] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions."
[17] "First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition."
[18] "Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts."
[19] "Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."
[20] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[21] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
[22] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."
[23] "Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed."
[24] "The strong metal oxidesupport interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the BN bond to O·."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets and are also found in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites exhibit higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. BNNTs have a higher mass-specific propane consumption rate than h-BN, making them more reactive. The high reactivity, selectivity, and stability of BN materials enhance propene productivity, making them attractive for commercial implementation. The theory of 1-D edge active sites explains the behavior of 2-D boron materials, with oxygen functionalization of BN sheets under ODHP conditions. DFT calculations reveal that propane dehydrogenation starts with hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming surface-stabilized propyl intermediates. Oxygen atoms tend to adsorb dissociatively, leading to irreversible oxygen functionalization of fresh edges. Zig-B edges are more active than armchair or zig-N edge sites. Propane dehydrogenation is favored on oxygen-modified edge sites over CC bond cleavage side reactions. However, h-BN materials with 1-D active sites have drawbacks, including an induction period for active site formation, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues. Strategies to improve performance include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts with strong metal oxide-support interactions.

1.硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D））对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为一维、二维和三维配置。1-D活性位点线性分布在二维六方氮化硼（h-BN）片层的边缘，也存在于硼氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）中。这些1-D活性位点显示出比传统金属氧化物催化剂更高的丙烯选择性。BNNTs的丙烷消耗率比h-BN高一个数量级，使其更具反应性。BN材料的高反应性、选择性和稳定性提高了丙烯的生产力，使其对商业应用具有吸引力。1-D边缘活性位点的理论解释了2-D硼材料的行为，在ODHP条件下，BN片层发生氧功能化。DFT计算表明，丙烷脱氢从丙烷中氢的抽离开始，形成表面稳定的丙基中间体。氧原子倾向于以解离方式吸附，导致新鲜边缘的不可逆氧功能化。Zig-B边缘比armchair或zig-N边缘位点更活跃。丙烷脱氢在氧改性的边缘位点上比CC键断裂的副反应更容易发生。然而，具有1-D活性位点的h-BN材料存在缺点，包括活性位点形成所需的诱导期、边缘活性位点密度低以及稳定性问题。提高性能的策略包括预氧改性以减少诱导期，减小BN纳米片的尺寸以增加边缘/表面比，以及将活性成分聚集到1-D形状的材料中。1-D分散活性位点的稳定性可以通过设计具有强金属氧化物-支撑相互作用的复合催化剂来增强。
