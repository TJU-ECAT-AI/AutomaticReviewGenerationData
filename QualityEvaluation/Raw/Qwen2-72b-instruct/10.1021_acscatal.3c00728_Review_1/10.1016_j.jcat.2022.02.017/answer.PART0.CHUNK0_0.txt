1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron species anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination, facilitated by ample SiOH groups on the surface, are crucial for the catalytic efficiency. The isolated boron species dynamically transform into aggregated ones during the ODHP process, which are closely related to the increased catalytic activity. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature.

1.文献没有具体说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能。但是，它确实提到，以开放配位形式锚定在沸石基质上的硼物种，由表面丰富的SiOH基团促进，对于催化效率至关重要。在ODHP过程中，孤立的硼物种动态转化为聚集态，这与催化活性的增加密切相关。与相邻SiOH基团形成氢键的聚集BOx物种中的BOH基团被鉴定为活性中心，并在低温下催化ODHP反应具有高效率。
