Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane: How far from commercial implementation?
Abstract This review examines the recent literature on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane, which aims for the synthesis of the corresponding alkenes. The following aspects are discussed: (a) the main features affecting the catalytic properties of systems based on supported vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide; (b) the characteristics of catalysts producing outstanding olefin yields; (c) advantages in selectivity gained by means of either special reactor configurations or non-conventional conduction of the reaction; (d) the contribution of homogeneous reactions to the formation of olefins during the oxidation of alkanes.
1. Introduction
The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:
1.
In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] . Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins.
2.
Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation.Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation.In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes  by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. As pointed out by Brazdil [2] : The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process. The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs. However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives. This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies. In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained. Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account.A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] . In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production?Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g., membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make it possible to improve performances as compared to the traditional configurations?Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:
1.
The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid. Some of these features may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the additional role played by structural defects, degree of crystallinity, etc. Experimental evidence is often provided to indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them, depending on what the investigator is looking for. Obviously, a collective interpretation is missing, which would be capable of bringing all these aspects together and outlining a general picture.
2.
It is also apparent that contradictory information derives from different experimental conditions, not so much regarding the procedure used for catalyst preparation and thermal treatment, as the conditions for catalytic tests. The latter may vary greatly, and key operative parameters are not only the reaction temperature, pressure and contact time, but also the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane. Very often oxygen-lean conditions are used, in order to obtain better selectivity to the olefin; this, however, implies that total oxygen conversion is reached and that, depending on the temperature, reactions leading to the formation of H2 may become significant (see Section 8 ). Therefore, the redox properties of the gas phase (either reducing or oxidizing) with regard to the metal cations are greatly affected by these operative parameters. This not only generates a dynamic situation with in situ modification of the active surface, but may also have implications on the reaction mechanism, even with a change in the rate-determining step of the reaction. Furthermore, this may affect the gas-phase concentration of by-products and co-products (e.g., CO2 and H2O), the presence of which may substantially alter the nature of the cation oxidation state, degree of agglomeration, and type of interaction with the support. This implies that reaction conditions may affect the nature of the catalyst characteristics. This problem may be overcome in part by studying catalyst characteristics under working conditions (in situ reactivity) and, even more so, by coupling this with a concomitant analysis of the reaction products. Over the past 10 years, the effort made by many groups to develop such experimental techniques is worth mentioning [22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] . Thus, the study of the dynamic changes introduced in the catalyst as a consequence of reaction conditions was made possible. Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests.
For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2. Indeed, the use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties.
In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide.
2. A classical system for alkane ODH: supported vanadium oxide
A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH. Below is a brief summary of some significant points, over which the scientific community seems to find general agreement; some controversial points are also mentioned. Although it cannot be stated that this is the definitive picture of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, nevertheless these points represent a good starting point for both scientific debate and a deeper comprehension of this important class of ODH catalysts.
Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:
1.
In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure. In fact, the olefin formation rate (per V atom) is influenced by vanadia surface density and reaches its peak value at intermediate surface densities [35] ,[36] ,[37] ,[38] . The initial selectivity ratio is affected by the surface density of active sites, thus suggesting that isolated structures prevailing at low surface densities are more selective for propane ODH [36] ,[37] ,[39] . Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx. A high selectivity to propylene can be achieved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species; however, polymeric V species can be conducive to consecutive propylene combustion reactions [40] . Small V2O5 crystallites above single-layer surface vanadia coverage do not contribute to propane ODH because of their low dispersion and small number of active surface sites. It has also been reported that, in the case of propane ODH, the apparent activation energy for propylene combustion is lower than that for alkene formation and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density [35] ,[36] ,[37] . This is due to the fact that the CH bond energy in propylene allylic C atom is weaker than the CH bond in the sec-C atom of propane, and the corresponding activation energy is also lower. Thus, for low reaction temperatures, the consecutive oxidative attack on propylene has an advantage over the direct activation of propane. Therefore, the highest selectivity of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operating at high temperatures that however avoid homogeneous reactions (e.g., lower than 550 C) [28] ,[36] . The same conclusion was reported by other authors, for reactivity tests performed in a multi-channel microreactor and with a V2O5-Al2O3 catalyst deposited on the reactor wall [41] . Above 500550 C, additional contributions to propylene formation may derive from the contribution of homogeneous reactions and of catalytic dehydrogenation as well, especially when operation is carried out under oxygen-lean conditions.
In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when increasing VOx density. Other authors found no significant variations in TOF with V2O5 content in zirconia-supported vanadium oxide [25] . It was suggested that these discrepancies might be due to differences in the molecular structure of surface vanadia species, the latter being a function of the operational conditions (i.e., propane/oxygen feed ratio) [27] .
2.
For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation. The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. Surface oxygen, OH groups and, especially, oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains [42] ,[43] ,[44] . The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH [45] .
3.
The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[28] ,[46] . Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios. The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities; therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity [47] . The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface [40] ,[48] ,[49] . The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reactivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking [23] ,[24] .
4.
ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes. The stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers [50] .
5.
The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27] ,[37] ,[46] ,[47] ,[51] ,[52] ,[53] ,[54] ,[55] ,[56] ,[57] ,[58] ,[59] ,[60] ,[61] ,[62] ,[63] ,[64] ,[65] ,[66] ,[67] ,[68] ,[69] ,[70] ,[71] ,[72] ,[73] ,[74] ,[75] . In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of V oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading [51] ,[52] ,[59] ,[61] . However, in this case, also, there are several contrasting indications in literature, and this is likely to be due to the different characteristics of the supports used and the different nature of the active species developed. With a silica support, one major problem is the hydrolysis of the SiOV bond in the reaction environment, with a development of segregated vanadium oxide. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but apparently turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure [37] . Conversely, Wachs and co-workers [53] ,[54] ,[55] found that in propane ODH, turnover frequency (TOF) values vary by more than an order of magnitude with the specific oxide support for both the isolated and polymeric surface VOx species. Therefore, the support may have a significant effect on the reaction parameters for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts [60] , because the support cation is a ligand that directly influences the reactivity of the bridging VO-support bond, and the catalytic active site, by controlling its basic character with the support electronegativity [53] . Evidence has been reported indicating that the O atom bridging V to the support may be the one participating in the catalytic cycle in isolated V species [27] ,[47] ,[54] ,[55] ,[56] ,[60] ,[76] . For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds per site as a function of the surface density [76] . An inverse trend was found between the steady-state catalytic TOF and the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts [57] . The same was found in alkanes ODH [56] ; the more electronegative supports lead to higher activity, because the higher the difference between the electronegativity of active metal cations or support cations with oxygen, the stronger the bond [58] .
6.
The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports [26] ,[77] ,[78] ,[79] . The formation of VOCr and VOMo bonds occurs above Mo + V monolayer coverages [80] . In titania-supported vanadium oxide, the increased selectivity is ascribed to the easier desorption of propylene from the less acidic surface, thus preventing the consecutive total combustion of propylene. The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with the work function values which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFeTi > VAlTi > VCaTi [81] . This implies that the lower the surface energy barrier for transfer of electrons from the catalyst to the reacting molecules is, the higher the selectivity is to the partial oxidation product. It is argued that owing to the decrease in this energy barrier the re-oxidation step in the catalytic reaction is fast, thus preventing the presence of intermediate non-selective electrophilic oxygen species on the surface [81] . The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surface CrOx modifier has greater intrinsic activity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites [82] . With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies which, in turn, are influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. The relative propane ODH and propylene combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces. For instance, the observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propylene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+) [83] .
7.
Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide [38] ,[59] ,[84] ,[85] ,[86] ,[87] ,[88] ,[89] ,[90] ,[91] ,[92] . Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases [84] ,[85] ,[86] ,[87] ,[88] . The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH [59] ,[88] . The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy. On the contrary, selectivity to ethylene in the ODH of ethane does not depend on the acidic properties or on the MO bond strength [84] ,[85] ,[86] ,[87] . Also, the basicity of the support may greatly affect selectivity [62] ; it is thought that the use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity because of the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. For instance, the addition of MgO to Al2O3 [88] or the use of MgAl2O4 [89] as supports for vanadium oxide positively affect the selectivity to propylene [38] .
3. Vanadium incorporated in hosting structures
A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites [7] ,[11] ,[93] . Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction [9] ,[94] ,[95] ,[96] ,[97] ,[98] ,[99] ,[100] ,[101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] . The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction. In many cases, site isolation has been achieved by simply depositing the active phase by impregnation over these high-surface-area supports.
Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49] ,[100] ,[106] ,[107] ,[108] ,[109] ,[110] ,[111]
, MCM-48
[112] or SBA-15 [112] ,[113] ,[114] ,[115] . In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material. An inert matrix seems to be required in order to achieve high selectivities in the ODH of propane [96] ,[97] , while acid materials are preferred for the ODH of ethane [101] ,[102] ,[103] ,[104] ,[105] .
In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116] . An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide [117] .
One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113] ,[115] , prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites. Vanadium species anchored to the surface showed structural properties similar to those on mesoporous VOx-MCM and conventional V2O5SiO2 catalysts, but a higher surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species could be achieved with the VOx-SBA-15 system. Moreover, the authors hypothesized that the large pore diameter of the material might favor the diffusion of propylene outside of the pores, thus preventing deep oxidation.
4. Supported molybdenum oxide
There are many analogies between catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide and those based on supported molybdenum oxide [56] ,[80] ,[118] ,[119] ,[120] ,[121] ,[122] ,[123] ,[124] ,[125] ,[126] ,[127] ,[128] ,[129] ,[130] ,[131] ,[132] and chromium oxide [133] ,[134] ,[135] ,[136] ,[137] ,[138] ,[139] ,[140] ,[141] ,[142] ,[143] . More specifically, in the case of molybdena-based systems:
1.
In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used [56] . Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. Turnover rates are higher on two-dimensional domains than on isolated monomers, and increase as the MoOx domain size increases. While the surface density further increases, TOF decreases as a result of the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3 crystallites. The ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propane combustion reactions increases with increasing surface density and then remains constant [118] . The size of MoOx domains also affects the MoO strength; stronger MoO bonds show lower ODH activity [119] .
2.
In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers. The molybdena phase is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary overoxidation of ethylene to COx [120] . Loadings corresponding to higher than the monolayer coverage lead to a decrease in catalytic activity, due to the growth of Al2MoO4 crystallites. Selectivity to ethylene increases when loading increases up to 15 wt.% and then remains constant. The best catalytic performance can be achieved with highly dispersed two-dimensional molybdenum species, which fully encapsulate the alumina surface [121] .
3.
The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde) [122] . When the support is alumina, the latter produces the formation of oxygenates and full oxidation; the lower acid strength of molybdena (compared to alumina) permits the rapid desorption of the olefin [123] . Surface pathways were found to play a significant role, even at temperatures at which homogeneous reactions also occurred, thus indicating the possible occurrence of a heterogeneoushomogeneous reaction scheme at high temperatures. In non-oxidative conditions, lattice oxygen activated ethane at the same temperature as in the presence of oxygen, leading mainly to ethylene production, since lattice oxygen was found to be less reactive to ethylene. More labile forms of oxygen, resulting from adsorption of gas-phase oxygen on the surface, are probably responsible for the extensive ethylene degradation observed at high conversion levels [124] .
4.
The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties [125] ,[126] . Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li). These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene. With zirconia-supported MoO3, potassium addition not only prevents crystalline Zr(MoO4)2 formation, thus suppressing the interaction of molybdenum oxide and zirconia phases, but also fosters the formation of three-dimensional molybdenum oxide and two-dimensional polymolybdates [128] . Both propylene selectivity and yield are enhanced thanks to a certain amount of added potassium.

In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167] ,[168] ,[174] ,[182] ,[270] ,[271] , and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O) [145] ,[162] ,[164] ,[272] ,[273] . In NiO-based catalysts, Ni interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina, by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages [168] . Ni promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH. Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice. The interaction with the support improves the catalytic performance, since unsupported NiO is unselective to ethylene. The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter. In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide (Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox) led to the development of a catalyst characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane ODH [167] .
Mo/V/Nb mixed oxides have been known since the 1970s to be efficient catalysts for ethane ODH [164] ,[274] ,[275] ,[276] ,[277] ,[278] ,[279] ,[280] ; the same catalysts also produce acetic acid from ethane, and the formation of the latter compound is boosted, over that of ethylene, by both the use of specific reaction conditions (e.g., high pressure), and the incorporation of promoters. The Mo/V/Nb/O system is selective to ethylene, but is only moderately active at temperatures lower than 300 C [164] ,[281] ,[282] . Mo/V/Te/Nb/O catalysts, prepared by hydrothermal synthesis [162] , were found to be extremely active and highly selective in the ODH of ethane, especially those with a MoVTeNb atomic ratio of 10.150.160.17 and heat-treated at 600650 C. On the best catalyst, selectivities higher than 80% at ethane conversion levels higher than 80% (75% ethylene yield) were obtained at relatively low reaction temperatures (340400 C). The catalytic performance was mainly related to the presence of orthorhombic Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) and (V, Nb)-substituted θ-Mo5O14. Also Mo/V/Sb mixed oxides are active and selective in ethane ODH; Ueda et al.
[283] ,[284] reported a selectivity to the olefin of 64% at an ethane conversion of 16.8% at 380 C with a Mo6V2Sb1Ox catalyst. More recently [145] , selectivity to ethylene higher than 80% at an ethane conversion of 65% was reported for samples prepared by heat treatment in N2 at 600 C. The good catalytic performance of this catalyst has been attributed to the presence of (SbO)2M20O56 (M = Mo, V) crystalline phase, similarly to that proposed for the Mo/V/Te/Nb/O system.
Other systems giving excellent performance are those based on RE oxides and oxychlorides, often in combination with alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides: Sr/La/Nd/O [190] , Sr/La/Fe/Cl/O, Sr/La/Cu/Cl/O, Y/Ba/Cu/O [192] ,[193] ,[194] , Li/Dy/Mg/O [184] , Sm/Na/P/O [189] . With these catalysts, which operate at reaction temperatures higher than 700 C, the mechanism is not the conventional redox one, and includes the relevant contribution of homogeneous reactions [see Section 7 ]. These systems yield ethylene productivities higher than 1 kg kgcat1 h1, which is the limit value below which the productivity is too low to be interesting for commercial application. Conversely, with the other catalytic systems, the ethylene productivity achieved is lower than 1, with the sole exception of NiO/MgO [174] .
Excellent performances have also been observed with Fe/P/O [185] and mesoporous V/Mg/O [155] catalysts.
In the case of propane ODH, Fig. 2 shows that the best yields reported are lower than 30%. In general, the main problem encountered in propane ODH is the presence of the consecutive reaction of olefin combustion that rapidly decreases the propylene yield when the conversion of the alkane is increased. Furthermore, oxygen becomes the limiting reactant, due to both the propane/oxygen feed ratio usually employed and the high O2 consumption in combustion reaction; consequently, propane conversions lower than 40% (with total oxygen conversion) are usually obtained.
The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides [231] ,[285] ,[286] . For instance, with a Li/Dy-doped MgO catalyst, at 650 C, the propylene yield is close to 24%, but if the formation of ethylene is also taken into account, the overall olefin yield is close to 48%. Addition of Li to MgO increased reaction rate and selectivity to olefins from 40 to 70% [231] ,[238] ; lithium is, therefore, an essential ingredient of the catalyst in order to create the active site. Doping with Cl slightly improved the olefin selectivity, but chloride-free catalysts showed superior stability with time-on-stream.
With these systems, the reaction mechanism includes the activation of propane (the rate-determining step) on the catalyst and the generation of propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase [285] ; the catalyst acts as an initiator, but may also affect conversion and selectivity via quenching and chain termination. Oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly, because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased. Moreover, oxygen facilitates the removal of hydrogen from the surface OH species that are formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst. A specific role has been attributed to the small fraction of O ions that can be removed from the surface of Li/MgO catalysts [286] ; in fact, it has been hypothesized that the sites containing this reactive oxygen are responsible for the activation of propane.
A similar oxycracking mechanism has also been reported for a catalyst made of CoNx supported on alumina [287] ; the overall selectivity to olefins (propylene + ethylene, the latter being the predominant product) obtained at 600 C was 49%, with a propane conversion of 77%.
Catalytic systems that are known to exhibit good performance in propane ODH are Ni(Co)MoO4 [19] ,[262] ,[288] ,[289] and V/Mg mixed oxides [290] ,[291] ,[292] ,[293] ,[294] ,[295] ,[296] ,[297] ,[298] ,[299] ,[300] ; however, usually the selectivity is good only for moderate propane conversion. Systems also giving good performance are made of isolated vanadium oxide impregnated either on MCF silica [214] or on SBA-15 [113] ,[114] ,[115] , and of molybdenum oxide impregnated over Mg/Al mixed oxide derived from thermal decomposition of a Mg/Al hydrotalcite [259] .
K-doped, SiO2/TiO2-supported MoO3 also exhibits good performance in propane ODH [127] ,[170] ,[172] ,[188] ,[239] ,[260] ,[301] ,[302] . The doping with chlorine alters the relative surface concentration of Si versus Ti, the electronic structure of surface MoOx domains, the oxygen environment around supported MoOx species in the Si/Ti network and finally the redox properties of Mo sites. These modifications led to an increase of the selectivity to the olefin (also observed in the case of ethane ODH), also ascribed to the MoOx species sharing more complex ligands with silica and titania, with the indirect participation of chlorine. The best propylene yield reported with this catalyst was close to 26%; however, the productivity achieved was very low.
Also gas-phase promoters added in the feed stream, such as N2O, may improve the catalytic performance [303] ,[304] ,[305] .
Table 2 also shows that the productivity achieved is, for the majority of catalysts, much lower than 1 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour. The low values reported are due to several factors: (i) the low intrinsic catalyst activity, (ii) the use of very alkane-diluted feed streams, and (iii) the use of low flow rates. Exceptions are the VOx-MCM-48 catalyst [117] and mesoporous V/Mg/O [221] , both giving propylene productivity significantly higher than 1 h1.
6. Staged feed of oxygen, membrane-type reactors, alternate feed of reactants
Several studies have explored approaches that minimize O2 concentrations in contact with the catalyst by separating hydrocarbon and oxygen, either temporally or spatially, using cyclic and membrane reactors, respectively. The reason for this is that the coexistence of alkanes and O2 leads to undesired combustion reactions, due to the unselective role that weakly adsorbed O species may play.
Lower O2 concentrations can be maintained throughout the reactor length by staging O2 introduction; staging also makes it possible to feed an amount of oxygen that would lead to explosive mixtures in the co-feed mode. Oxygen transport membranes or multiple injection points can be used to implement these methods [306] ,[307] ,[308] ,[309] ,[310] ,[311] ,[312] ,[313] ,[314] ,[315] ,[316] ,[317] ,[318] ,[319] ,[320] ,[321] ,[322] ,[323] ,[324] ,[325] . Tonkovich et al.
[306] reported 53% ethylene selectivity at 95% ethane conversion when using porous alumina membranes and a MgO/LiO/Sm2O3 catalyst at 600 C, whereas the selectivity was only 8% at similar conversion and temperature in a co-feed reactor. Also in the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, a better ethylene yield was obtained with a packed-bed membrane reactor (porous alumina membrane) with respect to a conventional packed-bed reactor configuration [282] . It is worth noting that in the case of propane ODH, conversely, the use of CMRs and of oxygen distribution, in general, has not brought remarkable improvements if compared to the conventional reactor configurations. Santamaria and co-workers [324] reported that in catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs), the propylene yields in propane ODH can be optimized with membranes that combine the appropriate V loading in the active layer with a sufficiently resistant diffusion layer.
Waku et al.
[311] found that in ethane ODH catalyzed by V2O5-Al2O3 co-feed and staged-O2 introduction modes led to similar ethane dehydrogenation and combustion rates, despite significant differences in the average O2 concentrations. However, the rate of ethylene combustion was lower when oxygen was introduced gradually, due to the lower contribution of homogeneous ethylene combustion pathways.
Some studies investigate the concept of fluidized bed membrane reactors (FLBMR) with distributed oxidant supply for alkanes ODH. Klose and co-workers [316] compared a conventional fluidized bed reactor and a packed-bed membrane reactor with a FLBMR, for the ODH of ethane using an alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst. For identical overall feed rates, the distributed oxidant feeding in the FLBMR significantly improved the selectivity to ethylene. The beneficial effect of oxidant dosing over the membrane was most significant at high temperatures and with long contact times. The maximum ethylene yield observed in the FLBMR was 37%. In addition to high productivity, for the FLBMR a more favorable operation range with respect to the oxygenhydrocarbon ratio was observed; this indicates a lower sensitivity to oscillations and disturbances in the reactant feed, corresponding to higher safety in operation.
Yang et al.
[307] ,[326] reported much higher ethylene selectivity (80%) at 84% conversion by using a mixed oxide ion conductor (Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2Ox) as catalyst and a membrane, than in a co-feed reactor. These are outstanding results, comparable to those obtained in thermal cracking. A dense perovskite hollow fiber membrane was also studied for ethane ODH [317] , and compared with the performance of a disk-shaped membrane [307] ,[318] . An improved selectivity was also obtained in the case of propane ODH; at 2327% propane conversion a selectivity of 44% to propylene was reported, versus a 15% selectivity achieved in the fixed-bed reactor [327] . Similarly, a better ethylene yield in ethane ODH as compared to steam cracking was obtained by Mirodatos and co-workers [328] , with a reactor using dense mixed-ion electron conducting membranes, made of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3; the application of a surface catalyst at the permeate side (V/MgO micrograins, Pd nano clusters) further enhanced the performance (75% yield). This was attributed to the importance of surface exchange phenomena for oxygen permeation.
Takehira et al.
[310] ,[329] reported a drastic enhancement in the rate of ethylene formation when using an electrochemical reactor Au/YSZ/Ag with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as solid electrolyte, and a MoV2O8 catalyst film on the electrochemical cell, at 500 C, under oxygen pumping through the cell, as compared to the conventional fixed-bed reactor. The enhancement effect was attributed to the supply of dissociated oxygen through the YSZ.
The extrapolation of the concept of controlling O2 concentration is represented by the so-called redox-decoupling or cyclic technology, which operates through the separation of the two steps included in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, i.e., (i) oxidation of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst, which must be able to draw off hydrogen and supply oxygen, for either the formation of water or its insertion onto the substrate, and which, therefore, undergoes simultaneous reduction (two electrons per each O2 ion furnished) and (ii) oxidation of the reduced catalyst by molecular oxygen. Several papers report the application of this type of operation for alkanes ODH [52] ,[199] ,[330] ,[331] ,[332] ,[333] ,[334] ,[335] ,[336] ,[337] ,[338] ,[339] ,[340] ,[341] ,[342] ,[343] ; in many cases, an improved selectivity to the olefin as compared to the co-feed operation and for the same level of alkane conversion has been achieved whereas, in other cases, no effective improvement has been reported. For instance, catalysts made of V2O5-SiO2 showed a remarkably improved selectivity to propylene with respect to the co-feed conditions for propane ODH, whereas the same remarkable effect was not observed with catalysts in which vanadium oxide was deposited on alumina or titania [52] ,[336] ( Fig. 3 ). Indeed, the very high selectivity to propylene obtained at low propane conversion in the redox mode was due to the relevant contribution of dehydrogenation to olefin formation over the strongly reduced catalyst.

One condition for obtaining an improved selectivity with the cyclic operation is the presence of catalysts in which the V sites are highly dispersed; this was achieved by preparing vanadium oxidesilica cogels, with a V2O5 content lower than 10% [336] . The improvement in selectivity to propylene was around 30 percentage points (60% selectivity in cyclic mode versus 30% in co-feed mode) for a propane conversion of 35% ( Fig. 3 ). The same positive effect on selectivity was obtained with Mg/V/O catalysts [333] ,[334] ,[335] .
The same concept has been used also with an alkane dehydrogenation catalyst [332] ,[344] ,[345] ,[346] , to shift the equilibrium of the reaction through a catalyst selective in H2 combustion. This can be carried out by feeding O2 together with the alkane; a (post)transition metal or its oxide can be used to selectively oxidize hydrogen [347] ,[348] ,[349] . Catalysts selective in H2 combustion in the presence of alkane and alkene are made of Pt/Sn-SiO2 or In2O3-SiO2 as long as the O2 fed is less than half the H2 [350] ,[351] , or Bi2O3-SiO2 [352] , or W-doped ceria (Ce0.9W0.1Oy) [345] . Propylene yield enhancements of 1.6 above equilibrium were achieved by the selective H2 removal using O2 staging, with dehydrogenation catalysts made of small Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5; more than 90% of the O2 introduced was used to form H2O from H2, even when hydrocarbons were the predominant available reactants [353] .
This approach has the advantage of the energy released by exothermic oxidation, which is needed to aid dehydrogenation. However, by mixing oxygen, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons at high temperatures, a dangerous mixture can be obtained. The separation of reactants using dense ion-conducting oxides or oxygen-selective membranes reduces the risk of explosion; however, as an alternative approach, the cyclic concept can be applied. Specifically, a solid oxygen carrier (SOC) is used to selectively remove H2 from the reactor and improve product yield [263] ,[345] ,[346] . Then, oxygen is flowed to re-oxidize the reduced SOC; the latter is typically a metal oxide that can easily sustain the redox cycle. The reduction of SOC by H2 can be either endo- or exothermic, depending on the type of oxide; in the latter case, the reduction provides the energy gain to support the endothermic dehydrogenation; otherwise, during the re-oxidation step the heat released is stored in the catalytic bed and carried over to the next cycle. The authors reported that the best SOC was Ce0.9W0.1Ox (selectivity to H2 oxidation higher than 97%), which  when coupled with a dehydrogenation catalyst  made it possible to enhance the conversion and selectivity to propylene compared to a conventional dehydrogenation reactor.
7. The contribution of homogeneous reactions to olefins formation: short-bed reactors and non-redox-type catalysts
In 1993, Huff and Schmidt first reported the selective ODH of ethane over a Pt-loaded honeycomb catalyst at millisecond contact time (short-bed reactors) and high reaction temperature (8501000 C) [354] . This technology appeared promising for both the compactness of its reactor and the potential energy efficiency that would allegedly result from its autothermal (adiabatic) operation. Since then, several teams have been investigating this possibility [190] ,[355] ,[356] ,[357] ,[358] ,[359] ,[360] ,[361] ,[362] ,[363] ,[364] ,[365] ,[366] ,[367] ,[368] ,[369] ,[370] ,[371] ,[372] ,[373] ,[374] ,[375] ,[376] ,[377] ,[378] ,[379] . The optimal catalyst contains a low Pt loading, deposited on a monolithic large-pore support [354] ,[380] ,[381] , based on either mullite [355] or Ba/Mn aluminate [357] (best performance 62% ethane conversion with 72% selectivity, and with H2 addition in the feed), or γ-alumina [371] ,[382] (best ethylene yield 50%). Other systems reported include Pt/Sn [362] ,[363] ,[366] ,[380] (best conversion 70%, with 85% selectivity to ethylene, and with H2 addition in feed), Pt/Rh gauzes [356] ,[377] , LaMnO3 [383] (best ethylene yield 55%), and LaMnO3 supported on ceramic foam (57% ethylene yield in ethane ODH) [369] ,[373] , Pt-LaMnO3 [374] (best ethylene yield 59%), Er/Sr/O-SiO2/Al2O3 [384] (best ethylene yield 55%), Cr/O-ZrO2 [385] , or even Ba/Mn aluminate [382] . An improved selectivity to ethylene can be obtained by feeding CO and H2 (sacrificial fuels) that are preferentially oxidized in place of ethane [362] ,[372] ,[380] , or by adding chlorine, which improves the Pt dispersion [386] . The typical per-pass ethylene molar yield of an ethane steam-cracker unit is 48%, with a selectivity close to 80% (78% molar yield upon recycling of the unconverted ethane). Therefore, yields achieved in short-bed reactors are comparable to those of commercial cracking units, and better than yields to olefins (ethylene + propylene) obtained in commercial naphtha steam-cracker units.
The formation of ethylene requires two steps: a catalytic exothermal oxidation of a fraction of the feed to CO/H2 and CO2/H2O followed by an endothermic thermal (uncatalyzed) cracking of the remaining ethane to ethylene (oxycracking) [111] ,[370] ,[380] ,[382] ; the same occurs in the case of propane, in which propylene and ethylene form via gas-phase oxidative pyrolysis [387] ,[388] . The role of the catalyst is limited to initiating the exothermic oxidation reactions and determining the heat release, while it does not affects the cracking reaction significantly [358] ,[359] ,[360] ,[361] ,[375] ; a partial reforming of the hydrocarbon downstream of the combustion zone was not ruled out [361] . The mechanism is therefore quite different from redox-type ODH, since it includes the important contribution of non-catalytic homogeneous reactions at high temperature; at these temperatures ignition is followed by gas-phase cracking (pyrolysis), thus producing alkenes and methane.
Indeed, the same reaction can be carried out without catalytic ignition at 850 C, with residence time 0.10.4 s, and with an ethylene yield of 68% [389] . The reaction proceeds thermally through conventional cracking, but the addition of O2 improves the conversion and makes the overall reaction become thermoneutral with a O2/ethane 0.2 molar feed ratio. Although similar yields are obtained in non-catalyzed oxidative pyrolysis, the use of the catalyst makes it possible to operate in a more energy-efficient manner, with lower contact times and reactor volumes.
In addition to ethane, the oxycracking of higher hydrocarbons was also studied [364] ,[365] . While ethane cracks to ethylene, methane and COx, propane, n-butane, n-pentane and hexane were found to crack to propylene and ethylene (and methane and COx) rather than undergo dehydrogenation; in general, however, yields to olefins were low. An opportunity for the oxycracking of alkanes has been described by Lange et al.
[361] , with the concomitant production of synthesis gas and unsaturated hydrocarbons for subsequent carbonylation or hydroformylation. Examples include the production of synthesis gas and ethylene or ethyne for hydroformylation to 1-propanol or butanediol, respectively, or the co-production of propylene or propyne with synthesis gas followed by production of 1-butanol or methylmetacrylate.
With non-redox-type catalysts the formation of olefins also occurs by heterogeneously initiated homogeneous reactions under more conventional conditions, i.e., with residence times higher than 0.1 s and temperatures in the 600750 C range [285] ,[286] ,[287] ,[390] ,[391] ,[392] ,[393] ,[394] . Catalysts described are based on Li/Dy/Cl-MgO [184] ,[285] ,[286] ,[390] ,[393] (best ethylene yield 77% from ethane, and best olefins yield 50% from propane), Li-Y2O3 [391] (best ethylene yield 51% from n-butane), Co/N-Al2O3 [287] , RE oxide-based catalysts [48] ,[189] ,[190] (best ethylene yield 46% from ethane, and best olefins yield 45% from propane), and perovskite-type halo-oxides (La/Sr/Fe/X/O) [192] (best ethylene yield 57.6%). Rare earth oxides offer the additional advantage of higher thermal stability and less sintering problems, compared to Pt-based systems. In the case of Li/Dy-MgO catalysts, it has been demonstrated that chlorine plays an important role [184] , since the active sites reside in molten LiCl. O2 is dissolved dissociatively in LiCl, forming hypochlorite OCl which, at high temperatures, decomposes to radical species. The latter activate the alkane by homolytic hydrogen abstraction, and the alkane radicals react further with OH to form an olefin. The main problem of these very active systems, however, is the catalyst stability, since their excellent performance is maintained only as long as the halogen is not removed, in the form of HCl, from the catalytically active phase.
Therefore, under these conditions the catalyst plays the role of a radical initiator, generating alkyl fragments that are then transformed into the olefins in the gas phase. In the case of propane, in general the performance is worse than that obtained in catalytic dehydrogenation (the latter gives a selectivity to propylene of 85% with propane conversion around 6570%), with propylene yields that are lower than 25%, but if the formation of ethylene is also included, the overall selectivity to olefins becomes considerably higher [48] ,[189] ,[394] .
The contribution of non-catalytic homogeneous reactions in alkanes ODH has been discussed in several papers [8] ,[13] ,[155] ,[186] ,[285] ,[396] ,[397] ,[398] ,[399] ,[400] ,[401] ,[402] . The reaction conditions leading to a main contribution of radicalic, homogeneous reactions have been widely discussed by Sinev [398] ; in general, the latter are aided by both the use of reaction temperatures higher than 500 C and the presence of large void fractions in the reactor. The formation of free radicals may occur on the catalyst surface (this is an energetically feasible process); radicals may then desorb into the gas phase, where the reaction proceeds (heterogeneously initiated homogeneous reactions) [396] . Under certain circumstances, these gas-phase reactions may be more selective than the completely heterogeneous process, and this may be one reason for the increased selectivity to the olefins which is sometimes observed when the reaction temperature is increased [13] . Certain thermochemical parameters of surface active sites, particularly the H-atom affinity E[OH] and the oxygen binding energy E[O] govern the kinetics of elementary heterogeneous reactions of free radicals [398] .
In their paper, Lange et al.
[361] examined the economics of oxycracking to assess its potential as an alternative to steam cracking. The authors concluded that: (i) investment savings achieved with the oxycracker reactor (smaller and cheaper than a steam-cracking furnace) were significantly offset by the cost of the O2 plant; (ii) variable costs were substantially similar for the two cases; (iii) potential savings in investments for the oxycracker was finally limited to the US$ 13/t that corresponds to 3% of the total manufacturing cost. This is too small to justify the cost of developing a new technology and the risk of commercializing it. The authors also reported that improvements in alkene yields can be realized by (a) tuning the catalyst porosity to allow for gas-phase reactions, and (b) tuning the chemical nature of the support to favor the complete oxidation of the hydrocarbon fuel to CO2/H2O instead of CO/H2. Further yield improvement can also be achieved by reactor design and heat management, in particular by preheating the feed and minimizing heat losses. Reactive fuel components (H2, CO, methanol, and acetone) can be added to the feed in order to spare valuable hydrocarbons for subsequent cracking.
Wolf et al.
[395] compared three different concepts for olefins production from propane, (i) the commercial catalytic dehydrogenation, (ii) the autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation over a Pt/alumina catalyst and (iii) the ODH with a titania-supported vanadium oxide catalyst. If exclusive propylene production is the objective, both oxidative process variants did not reveal an alternative to the non-oxidative propane conversion neither for consumption of energy nor raw material. On the contrary, if olefins are the desired products, the autothermal oxidative propane conversion might compete with the commercial non-oxidative process while the isothermal ODH did not show any advantage.
8. The formation of H2 during ODH
Another aspect concerns the significant formation of molecular H2 [13] ,[403] . While the formation of H2 may be expected with non-reducible metal oxides catalysts and high reaction temperatures, which are more conducive to cracking phenomena, H2 formation is unexpected under conditions that are typically considered to lead to the co-formation of H2O.
The formation of H2 under the typical conditions for alkanes ODH has been mentioned by some authors [403] ,[404] ,[405] ,[406] . Sinev et al.
[403] considered non-oxidative dehydrogenation and coking as the most important hydrogen formation pathways in propane ODH. Moreover, it was suggested that other reactions were involved, generally indicated as free-radical oxidations. Recent papers confirm that considerable amounts of H2 are produced under conditions of propane ODH, with vanadium oxide-based catalysts [46] ,[52] ,[336] ,[337] ,[338] ,[339] ,[340] .
Under the reaction conditions typically used for propane ODH, bulk vanadium oxide modifies its characteristics on the basis of the reaction conditions, and specifically of gas-phase composition and temperature. Indeed, in most cases ODH is carried out using O2 as the limiting reactant, since hydrocarbon-rich conditions may lead to a better selectivity to the olefin. This implies that the total conversion of oxygen is reached, especially when temperatures higher than 500 C are used. This causes the vanadium oxide stoichiometry to change along the catalytic fixed-bed, from V2O5 in the aerobic section of the reactor, to reduced vanadium oxide (V2O4, V2O3) in the fraction of bed that operates in the absence of molecular oxygen [407] . This corresponds to a change in the type of reaction occurring inside the reactor. In the first part of the catalytic bed, propane is oxidized to acetic acid, propylene, CO, CO2 and H2O. In the reducing section, conversely, propane is dehydrogenated to propylene and to aromatics/coke; however, one important contribution to H2 generation derives from WGS, which is efficiently catalyzed by V2O3 [340] . Therefore, these self-adapting properties of vanadium oxide make it possible to combine the formation of CO and H2O with the WGS reaction, and to obtain H2 and CO2 as main products. However, when catalytic systems more selective to propylene, made of alumina- or silica-supported vanadium oxide, were used, the formation of H2 was exclusively due to the catalytic dehydrogenation [46] . This result was attributed to the fact that, in these catalysts, vanadium was not reduced below the oxidation state V4+, even under reaction conditions leading to the total oxygen conversion. Consequently, these catalysts produced less H2 than bulk vanadium oxide.
9. Conclusions
Over the past few years, significant steps forward have been made in the study of new catalyst types and reactor configurations for the ODH of ethane and propane. Especially in the case of ethane, the ethylene yield values reported with some catalysts are comparable to, or even better than, the corresponding values obtained by steam cracking. The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective. Moreover, for both ethane and propane ODH, very little information is reported in literature concerning catalysts lifetime.
It is evident that, in the future, the greatest efforts will be devoted to the study of catalysts and/or reactor configurations that are capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion.
