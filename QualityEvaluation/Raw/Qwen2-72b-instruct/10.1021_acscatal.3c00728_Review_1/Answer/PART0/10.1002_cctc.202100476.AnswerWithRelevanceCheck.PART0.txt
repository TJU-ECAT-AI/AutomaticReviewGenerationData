          [1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."
          [2] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
          [3] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
          [4] "Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."
          [5] "The morphology of the catalyst as well as the effect of the h-BN loading was investigated."
          [6] "The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure."
          [7] "The average diameters were 155nm, 199nm, 220nm, 237nm, and 274nm for nanofiber catalysts with h-BN weight amounts of 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7wt%, respectively."
          [8] "The nanofibers with varying h-BN loadings were prepared via the addition of different weight exfoliated h-BN."
          [9] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."
          [10] "The propane conversion increased with the reaction temperature increasing, typically, as the temperature increased from 480 to 510C, the propane conversion of h-BN (7wt%)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst increased from 3.6% to 22.2%."
          [11] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [12] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1."
          [14] "This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."
          [15] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional fibrous structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst and the effect of h-BN loading have been investigated, showing that the average diameter of the nanofibers increases with h-BN loading. The propane conversion increases with reaction temperature and h-BN loading, indicating that the conversion is not limited by molecular diffusion. The one-dimensional structure of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst facilitates active site exposure, leading to higher conversion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibits a high productivity of olefins under high space velocity conditions, due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed. This productivity is remarkably higher than that of bulk h-BN catalysts and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.
