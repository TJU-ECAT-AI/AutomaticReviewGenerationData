However, it does suggest that the active sites might involve boron-oxygen coordination, which plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. The active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.", "Doi": "10.1002/cctc.201701140"},

However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to its efficiency. Understanding and controlling the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could potentially lead to further improvements in catalyst design for ODHP and other reactions. The literature also highlights the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a role in the catalyst's performance.
