The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites have been found to offer higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs exhibiting higher mass-specific propane consumption rates than h-BN. The high reactivity, selectivity, and stability of BN materials have led to enhanced propene productivity, making them attractive for commercial implementation in ODHP processes. The reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen from propane, followed by the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to form propene. Different types of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, zigzag B-terminated, and zigzag nitride-terminated edges, have been explored, with the zigzag B-terminated edge being more active. Strategies to improve the performance of 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing the edge density by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which can extend catalytic stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron species anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination, facilitated by ample SiOH groups on the surface, are crucial for the catalytic efficiency. The isolated boron species dynamically transform into aggregated ones during the ODHP process, which are closely related to the increased catalytic activity. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of defect boron sites in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The literature also suggests that enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, with selective sites being quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. Doping CNFs with B or P enhances the selectivity to propene at isoconversion, with the type of heteroatom and precursor affecting the selectivity.

However, it does highlight the importance of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a metal-free catalyst that shows superior selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with negligible CO2 formation. The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while avoiding propylene oxidation to CO2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional fibrous structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst and the effect of h-BN loading have been investigated, showing that the average diameter of the nanofibers increases with h-BN loading. The propane conversion increases with reaction temperature and h-BN loading, indicating that the conversion is not limited by molecular diffusion. The one-dimensional structure of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst facilitates active site exposure, leading to higher conversion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibits a high productivity of olefins under high space velocity conditions, due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed. This productivity is remarkably higher than that of bulk h-BN catalysts and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show remarkable selectivity towards propene formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The modification with borate and phosphate is reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures. The protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40kJmol1 higher activation energy of O2 conversion. The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt%, thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%. The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites might involve boron-oxygen coordination, which plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. The active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, typical of 0D single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical of 2D surface catalysts. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by improving selectivity to olefins and preventing the facile overoxidation of propene to COx.

However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to its efficiency. Understanding and controlling the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could potentially lead to further improvements in catalyst design for ODHP and other reactions. The literature also highlights the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a role in the catalyst's performance. The literature suggests that the design of efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications should consider the optimization of mass and heat transfer processes, the utilization of active sites, and the suppression of secondary reactions of deep oxidation.

The crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, typical of 0D single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical of 2D surface catalysts. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by improving selectivity to olefins and preventing the facile overoxidation of propene to COx.

No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, or how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to its efficiency. Understanding and controlling the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could potentially lead to further improvements in catalyst design for ODHP and other reactions. The literature also highlights the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a role in the catalyst's performance. The literature suggests that the design of efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications should consider the optimization of mass and heat transfer processes, the utilization of active sites, and the suppression of secondary reactions of deep oxidation.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites have been found to offer higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs exhibiting higher mass-specific propane consumption rates than h-BN. The high reactivity, selectivity, and stability of BN materials have led to enhanced propene productivity, making them attractive for commercial implementation in ODHP processes. The reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen from propane, followed by the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to form propene. Different types of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, zigzag B-terminated, and zigzag nitride-terminated edges, have been explored, with the zigzag B-terminated edge being more active. Strategies to improve the performance of 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing the edge density by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which can extend catalytic stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron species anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination, facilitated by ample SiOH groups on the surface, are crucial for the catalytic efficiency. The isolated boron species dynamically transform into aggregated ones during the ODHP process, which are closely related to the increased catalytic activity. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of defect boron sites in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, with selective sites being quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. Doping CNFs with B or P enhances the selectivity to propene at isoconversion, with the type of heteroatom and precursor affecting the selectivity.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional fibrous structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst and the effect of h-BN loading have been investigated, showing that the average diameter of the nanofibers increases with h-BN loading. The propane conversion increases with reaction temperature and h-BN loading, indicating that the conversion is not limited by molecular diffusion. The one-dimensional structure of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst facilitates active site exposure, leading to higher conversion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibits a high productivity of olefins under high space velocity conditions, due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed.

However, it does mention that boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show remarkable selectivity towards propene formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The modification with borate and phosphate is reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures. The protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40kJmol1 higher activation energy of O2 conversion. The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt%, thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%. The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

However, it does mention that boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show remarkable selectivity towards propene formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The modification with borate and phosphate is reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures. The protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40kJmol1 higher activation energy of O2 conversion. The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt%, thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%. The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that the one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes. The uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the surface of the open fiber framework contributed to the high catalytic performance. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites might involve boron-oxygen coordination, which plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. The active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, typical of 0D single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical of 2D surface catalysts. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by improving selectivity to olefins and preventing the facile overoxidation of propene to COx.

No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, or how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to its efficiency. Understanding and controlling the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could potentially lead to further improvements in catalyst design for ODHP and other reactions. The literature also highlights the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a role in the catalyst's performance. The literature suggests that the design of efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications should consider the optimization of mass and heat transfer processes, the utilization of active sites, and the suppression of secondary reactions of deep oxidation.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Active sites can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) configurations. 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). These 1-D active sites have been found to offer higher selectivity for propene compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs exhibiting higher mass-specific propane consumption rates than h-BN. The high reactivity, selectivity, and stability of BN materials have led to enhanced propene productivity, making them attractive for commercial implementation in ODHP processes. The reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen from propane, followed by the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to form propene. Different types of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, zigzag B-terminated, and zigzag nitride-terminated edges, have been explored, with the zigzag B-terminated edge being more active. Strategies to improve the performance of 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing the edge density by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which can extend catalytic stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron species anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination, facilitated by ample SiOH groups on the surface, are crucial for the catalytic efficiency. The isolated boron species dynamically transform into aggregated ones during the ODHP process, which are closely related to the increased catalytic activity. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature. No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of defect boron sites in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species. The literature also suggests that enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers. The literature does not provide information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, nor does it discuss how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The literature does not provide information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) in the activity of propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, with selective sites being quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. Doping CNFs with B or P enhances the selectivity to propene at isoconversion, with the type of heteroatom and precursor affecting the selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge B atoms in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on boron nitride nanosheets. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, and BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane. These sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2, leading to the production of ethylene. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these edge active sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a metal-free catalyst that shows superior selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with negligible CO2 formation. The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while avoiding propylene oxidation to CO2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional fibrous structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst and the effect of h-BN loading have been investigated, showing that the average diameter of the nanofibers increases with h-BN loading. The propane conversion increases with reaction temperature and h-BN loading, indicating that the conversion is not limited by molecular diffusion. The one-dimensional structure of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst facilitates active site exposure, leading to higher conversion. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibits a high productivity of olefins under high space velocity conditions, due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed. This productivity is remarkably higher than that of bulk h-BN catalysts and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction.
