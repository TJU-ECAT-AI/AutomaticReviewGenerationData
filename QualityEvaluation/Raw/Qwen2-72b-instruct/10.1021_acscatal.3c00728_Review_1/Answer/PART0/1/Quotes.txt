          [10] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane."
          [11] "The generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>NOCH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene."

          [14] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
          [15] "Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."
          [16] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions."
          [17] "First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition."
          [18] "Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts."
          [19] "Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."
          [20] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
          [21] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."
          [22] "In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts."
          [23] "Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed."
          [24] "The strong metal oxidesupport interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the BN bond to O·."











[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."
          [2] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."
          [3] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."
          [4] "Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."
          [5] "The morphology of the catalyst as well as the effect of the h-BN loading was investigated."
          [6] "The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure."
          [7] "The average diameters were 155nm, 199nm, 220nm, 237nm, and 274nm for nanofiber catalysts with h-BN weight amounts of 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7wt%, respectively."
          [8] "The nanofibers with varying h-BN loadings were prepared via the addition of different weight exfoliated h-BN."
          [9] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."
          [10] "The propane conversion increased with the reaction temperature increasing, typically, as the temperature increased from 480 to 510C, the propane conversion of h-BN (7wt%)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst increased from 3.6% to 22.2%."
          [11] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."
          [12] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."
          [13] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1."
          [14] "This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction."
          [15] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."







[1] "The exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction to generate propene has the potential to be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry."
          [2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
          [3] "A supported vanadia on silica catalyst (V/SiO2) was used in this work to make direct comparisons with the catalytic performance of BN."
          [4] "The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the facile overoxidation of propene to COx."
          [5] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts."
          [6] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
          [7] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
          [8] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
          [9] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."
