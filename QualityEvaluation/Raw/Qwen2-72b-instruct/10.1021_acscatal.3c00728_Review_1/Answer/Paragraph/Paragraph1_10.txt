In the realm of catalytic chemistry, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a critical process for the production of propylene, a key building block in the petrochemical industry. The performance of this reaction is significantly influenced by the nature of the active sites present in boron (B)-based catalysts. These active sites, particularly those with a one-dimensional (1-D) edge structure, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and high activity. The spatial distribution of these sites is crucial, as it affects the accessibility of reactants and the efficiency of the catalytic process. Classification of these active sites based on their geometric and electronic properties provides insights into their reactivity and selectivity. Understanding the role of 1-D edge active sites not only aids in the design of more efficient catalysts but also deepens our comprehension of the reaction mechanisms involved in ODHP. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of next-generation catalysts that can enhance the yield and selectivity of propylene production, thereby contributing to more sustainable and economically viable petrochemical processes.
