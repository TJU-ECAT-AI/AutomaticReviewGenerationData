        The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. These catalysts feature active sites classified as 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D, with 1-D sites on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets or BNNTs showing higher propene selectivity than conventional metal oxides \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. BNNTs outperform h-BN in mass-specific propane consumption, enhancing propene productivity due to their high reactivity and selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming a propyl intermediate and propene \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. DFT studies reveal the zigzag B-terminated edge as the most active \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. Challenges include an induction period, low edge density, and stability issues, which can be addressed by preoxygen modification, reducing BN nanosheet size, and aggregating active components into 1-D shapes \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\]. Composite catalysts like h-BNxIn2O3 enhance stability through the SMOSI effect \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1\].

Isolated boron species in B-based catalysts for ODHP transform into aggregated ones during the reaction, enhancing catalytic activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Aggregated BOx species, particularly those with BOH groups hydrogen bonded to adjacent SiOH groups, are identified as high-efficiency active centers for ODHP at low temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Defect boron sites are crucial for catalyzing ODHP, with aggregated species more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Uniformly anchoring boron species to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix may construct highly active boron centers \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\].

Defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) are crucial for propane oxidative dehydrogenation activity in B-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Understanding the unique properties and mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could enhance catalyst design for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, CNFs' basal plane edges with a high density of defects act as active sites, where quinone or dicarbonyl groups are selective for propene, unlike unselective carboxylic acids \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Doping with B or P enhances propene selectivity at isoconversion, influenced by the heteroatom type and precursor \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing efficient catalysts \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\].

Edge B atoms in boron nitride nanosheets play a critical role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, forming BO(H) active sites at the edges \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. These 1-D edge active sites activate O2, abstract hydrogen from ethane, and produce ethylene \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. Understanding these unique properties and mechanisms could lead to the design of more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\].

Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, exhibits superior selectivity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene with minimal CO2 formation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. The active BNO. site, formed by hydrogen abstraction from BOH groups by molecular oxygen, selectively breaks the CH bond, avoiding propylene oxidation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms is essential for designing more efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, 1-D nanomaterials like h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers are advantageous due to their ability to facilitate substance transmission and expose active sites \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. Prepared by electrospinning, these nanofibers exhibit uniform h-BN dispersion on a SiO2 support, enhancing activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. The one-dimensional structure facilitates active site exposure, increasing propane conversion \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\], and the catalyst shows high productivity of propylene under high space velocity conditions \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\].

Boron oxide-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) enhance propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), demonstrating the protective effect against O2 activation, even at low loadings \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. This modification increases propene selectivity from 17% to 28% while decreasing the overall reaction rate, improving propene production by up to 18% \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. The maximum propene productivity is achieved at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt% \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms can contribute to designing more efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/anie.200901826\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, 1-D nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and ensure high catalytic activity at high WHSV \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. The uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the fiber framework contribute to high performance \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites can lead to more efficient catalyst design for commercial applications \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, boron-oxygen coordination is critical, affecting active-site density and electronic interactions \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Surface-stabilized BOx sites form on all tested boride catalysts, with crystal structure influencing BOx species formation and active-site density \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Layered and tetragonal borides differ in boron surface concentration, impacting BOx species formation \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, the 1-D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site prevents the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. This unique property enhances selectivity to olefins and mitigates the facile overoxidation of propene to COx, contributing to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

For B-based catalysts in ODHP, the h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and productivity, with a thin h-BN layer optimizing mass and heat transfer \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. The thickness and uniform dispersion of the h-BN layer are crucial, indicating the importance of the spatial distribution of active sites \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. Efficient catalyst design for commercial ODHP should focus on optimizing mass and heat transfer, utilizing active sites, and suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\].
