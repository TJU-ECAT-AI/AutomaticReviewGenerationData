<file-attachment-contents filename="Review A.txt"> 
The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. 1-D active sites, particularly those on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets or BNNTs, exhibit higher propene selectivity than conventional metal oxide catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. BNNTs demonstrate a notably higher mass-specific propane consumption rate than h-BN \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to produce propene \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Strategies to improve 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing edge density by reducing BN nanosheet size, and aggregating active components into 1-D shapes \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Composite catalysts, like h-BNxIn2O3, enhance the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions open up new avenues for catalyst design. Future research should focus on the precise control of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, particularly the optimization of 1-D edge sites, to enhance selectivity and productivity. Innovations in catalyst preparation methods, such as electrospinning for the synthesis of 1-D nanofibers, could lead to the development of catalysts with superior mass and heat transfer properties. Additionally, the exploration of novel boron-based materials with enhanced stability and reactivity, as well as the integration of these materials into composite catalysts, could significantly improve the efficiency of ODHP processes for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. 1-D active sites, particularly those found on the edges of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) sheets and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit higher selectivity for propene than conventional metal oxide catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. These sites' high reactivity, selectivity, and stability enhance propene productivity, making them commercially viable \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to produce propene \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. DFT calculations reveal that the zigzag B-terminated edge is more active than other 1-D edge types \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Strategies to improve 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to shorten the induction period, increasing edge density by reducing BN nanosheet size, and aggregating active components into 1-D shapes \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. The stability of 1-D dispersed active sites can be enhanced by designing composite catalysts, such as h-BNxIn2O3, which strengthens interlayer forces and reduces oxygen affinity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\].

Isolated boron species in B-based catalysts dynamically transform into aggregated ones, enhancing catalytic activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Aggregated BOx species, particularly BOH groups hydrogen bonded with adjacent SiOH groups, serve as active centers for efficient ODHP at low temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Aggregated boron species are more effective in propane CH bond activation than isolated species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Uniformly anchoring boron species to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix may construct highly active boron centers \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\].

Defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) are crucial for propane oxidative dehydrogenation activity in B-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Understanding these 1-D edge active sites' properties and reaction mechanisms can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding the spatial distribution, classification, and performance of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP, with a focus on 1-D edge active sites, open up new avenues for catalyst design and reaction mechanism elucidation. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of innovative strategies to enhance the stability and reactivity of 1-D edge active sites, such as the use of novel precursors and synthesis methods. Additionally, the exploration of the synergistic effects between 1-D edge active sites and other active sites, such as 2-D and 3-D sites, could lead to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. The integration of computational methods, such as DFT calculations, with experimental techniques could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and help guide the rational design of B-based catalysts.
