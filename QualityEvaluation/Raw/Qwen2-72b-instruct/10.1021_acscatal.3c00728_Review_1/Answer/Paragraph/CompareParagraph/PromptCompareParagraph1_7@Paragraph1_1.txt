<file-attachment-contents filename="Review A.txt"> 
The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. These sites are categorized into 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D configurations, with 1-D sites linearly dispersed on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets or BNNTs. The 1-D sites exhibit higher propene selectivity than conventional metal oxide catalysts, particularly BNNTs, which show higher mass-specific propane consumption rates \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to produce propene \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Strategies to enhance 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to reduce the induction period, increasing edge density by reducing BN nanosheet size, and aggregating active components into 1-D shapes \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Composite catalysts, like h-BNxIn2O3, improve stability by strengthening interlayer forces and weakening BN bond affinity to oxygen \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\].

    Defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) are crucial for propane oxidative dehydrogenation activity in B-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms can significantly contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, despite a lack of literature on spatial distribution and dimensionality effects \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\].

    Aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Uniformly anchoring boron species to a hydroxyl-rich zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may construct highly active boron centers \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\].

    Edge B atoms in B-based catalysts play a critical role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by activating O2 and forming BO(H) active sites, particularly at 1-D edges \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. These sites facilitate hydrogen abstraction from propane with O2 assistance, leading to ethylene production \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. Understanding these 1-D edge active sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms is essential for designing more efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\].

    Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, exhibits superior selectivity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene with minimal CO2 formation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. The active BNO. site, formed by hydrogen abstraction from BOH groups by molecular oxygen, selectively breaks the CH bond, avoiding propylene oxidation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. Understanding these 1-D edge active sites enhances catalyst design for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\].

    The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional structure, facilitates active site exposure, enhancing activity and selectivity \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. This is evidenced by the increased propane conversion with higher h-BN loading and reaction temperature, indicating that conversion is not diffusion-limited \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. The catalyst's high productivity of propylene and olefins under high space velocity conditions is attributed to enhanced mass transfer, allowing for easy exposure of active sites \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. This performance surpasses that of bulk h-BN and most boron-based catalysts reported for ODHP \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\].

    Boron oxide modified CNTs exhibit high selectivity for propene in ODHP reactions, with borate and phosphate blocking combustion sites, suppressing carbon framework combustion \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. This protective effect raises O2 activation energy by 40 kJ/mol, demonstrating that a small fraction of surface functionalities (0.003 wt% B2O3) are catalytically active \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28%, and productivity peaks at 0.01 wt% B2O3 loading, improving propene production by 18% \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites can enhance catalyst design for commercial applications \[10.1002/anie.200901826\].

    In B-based catalysts for ODHP, 1-D nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitations and ensure high catalytic activity at high WHSV \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. The uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the fiber framework contribute to high performance \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\].

    In B-based catalysts for ODHP, boron-oxygen coordination is critical, with active-site density and electronic interactions affecting reactivity \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Surface-stabilized BOx sites form on all tested boride catalysts, with crystal structure influencing BOx species formation and active-site density \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Layered and tetragonal borides have differing boron surface concentrations, impacting BOx species formation \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Understanding these properties, especially of 1-D edge active sites, aids in designing more efficient catalysts \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\].

    In B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the 1-D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site prevents the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation, typical issues with 0D and 2D catalysts \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. This unique property enhances selectivity to olefins and mitigates the facile overoxidation of propene to COx, contributing to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

    The performance of B-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is influenced by the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, with 1-D edge sites being crucial \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. A hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and productivity in ODHP due to optimized mass and heat transfer \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. The thickness and uniform dispersion of the h-BN layer play a significant role in the catalyst's performance, highlighting the importance of spatial distribution of active sites \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. Optimizing these factors can lead to more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\].

    

    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel B-based catalysts with enhanced 1-D edge active sites, aiming to further improve selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions.

Additionally, the exploration of composite catalysts that combine the strengths of B-based materials with other components could offer new avenues for enhancing stability and catalytic efficiency. The integration of advanced characterization techniques and computational methods could also provide deeper insights into the behavior of 1-D edge active sites under reaction conditions, guiding the rational design of catalysts for ODHP and other related processes.
