The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. 1-D active sites, found on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets and BNNTs, exhibit higher selectivity for propene than conventional metal oxide catalysts, with BNNTs showing notably higher mass-specific propane consumption rates \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. BN materials' high reactivity, selectivity, and stability enhance propene productivity, making them commercially viable for ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate and subsequent radical rebound to produce propene \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Among 1-D edge active sites, the zigzag B-terminated edge is more active \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Strategies to improve 1-D BN edge active sites include preoxygen modification to shorten the induction period, increasing edge density by reducing BN nanosheet size, and aggregating active components into 1-D shapes \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\]. Enhancing the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites through composite catalyst design, such as h-BNxIn2O3, can extend catalytic stability \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1\].

Isolated boron species in B-based catalysts dynamically transform into aggregated ones, enhancing catalytic activity for ODHP \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Aggregated BOx species, particularly those with BOH groups hydrogen-bonded to adjacent SiOH groups, are identified as high-efficiency active centers for ODHP at low temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are crucial for catalyzing the ODHP reaction, with aggregated species more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than isolated species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\]. Uniformly anchoring boron species to a hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix may construct highly active boron centers \[10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017\].

Defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) are crucial for propane oxidative dehydrogenation activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\]. Understanding the unique properties and mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites can significantly contribute to the design of more efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, 1-D edge active sites on CNFs, particularly quinone or dicarbonyl groups, are critical due to their high density of defects accessible to reactants \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Doping with B or P enhances selectivity to propene, influenced by the type of heteroatom and precursor \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\]. Understanding these sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms is key to designing more efficient catalysts \[10.1002/cssc.201402363\].

Edge B atoms in B-based catalysts play a critical role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by activating O2 and forming BO(H) active sites, particularly at 1-D edges \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. These sites abstract hydrogen from propane with O2 assistance, producing propylene \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\]. Understanding these unique properties and mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites is essential for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/cctc.201700725\].

Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, demonstrates superior selectivity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene with minimal CO2 formation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. The active BNO. site, generated by hydrogen abstraction from BOH groups by molecular oxygen, selectively breaks the CH bond, avoiding propylene oxidation \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\]. Understanding these 1-D edge active sites aids in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1002/cctc.201700004\].

The 1-D h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, prepared by electrospinning, significantly enhances active site exposure in ODHP reactions, leading to higher propane conversion and propylene productivity \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. The catalyst's performance improves with increased h-BN loading and reaction temperature, indicating efficient mass transfer and active site utilization \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\]. Its productivity of olefins under high space velocity conditions is notably higher than most boron-based catalysts, highlighting the benefits of its 1-D structure in facilitating substance transmission and active site participation \[10.1002/cctc.202100476\].

Boron oxide modified CNTs exhibit enhanced propene selectivity in ODHP, with borate and phosphate blocking combustion sites, suppressing carbon framework combustion \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. This protective effect raises O2 activation energy by ~40 kJ/mol, demonstrating that a low 0.003 wt% loading of boron oxide significantly impacts catalytic activity \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Propene selectivity rises from 17% to 28%, while the reaction rate decreases, improving propene production by up to 18% \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Maximum propene productivity is achieved at 0.01 wt% B2O3 loading \[10.1002/anie.200901826\]. Understanding 1-D edge active sites could lead to more efficient catalyst design for commercial use \[10.1002/anie.200901826\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, 1-D nanofibers with open pore structures prevent diffusion limitation and ensure high catalytic activity at high WHSV \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. The uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the fiber framework contribute to high performance \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\]. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications \[10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, boron-oxygen coordination is critical, affecting active-site density and electronic interactions \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Surface-stabilized BOx sites form on all tested boride catalysts, with crystal structure influencing BOx species formation and active-site density \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Layered borides may have different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides, impacting BOx species formation \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\]. Understanding these factors, especially for 1-D edge active sites, is key to designing efficient catalysts for commercial applications \[10.1002/cctc.201701140\].

In B-based catalysts, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) as an active site prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical issues with 0D and 2D catalysts \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\]. This unique property enhances selectivity to olefins and mitigates the facile overoxidation of propene to COx, crucial for designing efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications \[10.1126/science.aaf7885\].

In B-based catalysts for ODHP, the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, particularly 1-D edge sites, significantly impact performance \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. A h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst demonstrates high efficiency due to optimized mass and heat transfer, influenced by the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\]. Controlling the spatial distribution of active sites could enhance catalyst design for commercial ODHP applications, focusing on mass and heat transfer optimization, active site utilization, and suppression of deep oxidation secondary reactions \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028\].

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel B-based catalysts with optimized 1-D edge active sites, aiming to enhance propene selectivity and productivity. Strategies could include the design of catalysts with tailored pore structures to facilitate mass transfer and active site exposure, as well as the exploration of composite materials that combine the advantages of BN materials with other catalytically active components. Additionally, the investigation of the dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated ones could provide insights into the enhancement of catalytic activity at low temperatures. The understanding of the unique properties and mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, particularly the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN, could lead to the design of catalysts that prevent the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppress overoxidation of adsorbed species. Moreover, the optimization of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, especially in h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications by improving mass and heat transfer, active site utilization, and the suppression of deep oxidation secondary reactions.
