1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that specifically address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, or how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a role in the catalyst's performance. The literature also discusses the role of the monolithic structure in optimizing mass and heat transfer, which can influence the reaction mechanism and efficiency.

1.在文献中没有找到特别说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度性如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能，以及理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，如何有助于设计更有效的催化剂以供商业应用的相关引用。然而，文献确实强调了h-BN层的厚度和在堇青石整体催化剂上的均匀分散的重要性，这表明活性位点的空间分布对催化剂性能有影响。文献还讨论了整体结构在优化质量和热传递中的作用，这可能会影响反应机制和效率。
