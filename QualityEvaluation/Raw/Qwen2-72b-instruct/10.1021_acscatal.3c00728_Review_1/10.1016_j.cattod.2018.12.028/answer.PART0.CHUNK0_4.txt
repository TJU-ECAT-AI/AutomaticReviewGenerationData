1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that specifically address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and uniform dispersion on the cordierite monolithic catalyst, which suggests that the distribution and dimensionality of active sites can impact catalytic performance. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by optimizing mass and heat transfer processes.

1.在文献中没有找到特别说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的相关引用。但是，文献确实强调了h-BN层的厚度和在堇青石整体催化剂上的均匀分散的重要性，这表明活性位点的分布和维度可能会影响催化性能。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，可以通过优化质量和热传递过程，为设计更高效的催化剂以适应商业应用做出贡献。
