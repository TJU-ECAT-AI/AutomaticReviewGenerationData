1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, or how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, improving the utilization of h-BN and enhancing catalytic performance. The well-developed straight-channel structure of the h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, which may play a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The high thermal conductivity of h-BN and the ability to increase gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) contribute to the heat transfer during reactions and minimize the formation of COx byproducts. The literature suggests that the design of efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications should consider the optimization of mass and heat transfer processes, the utilization of active sites, and the suppression of secondary reactions of deep oxidation.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度(1-D, 2-D, 3-D)如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能,以及理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制,特别是1-D边缘活性位点,如何有助于设计更有效的催化剂以供商业应用的相关引文。然而,文献确实讨论了六方氮化硼(h-BN)洗涂石英石质催化剂在ODHP中的制备和性能,该催化剂表现出高选择性和生产力。催化剂的结构,即在石英石质上形成一层薄薄的h-BN,优化了质量和热传递,提高了h-BN的利用率,增强了催化性能。h-BN/石英石质的直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间,这可能在丙烷的氧化脱氢中发挥作用。h-BN的高热导率和增加气体小时空间速度(GHSV)的能力有助于反应期间的热传递,并最小化COx副产品的形成。文献表明,设计用于商业ODHP应用的高效B基催化剂应考虑质量与热传递过程的优化、活性位点的利用以及深度氧化副反应的抑制。
