1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that specifically address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, the literature does highlight the importance of the h-BN layer's thickness and its role in improving the utilization of h-BN by coating a thin layer on the cordierite. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, are not directly discussed, but understanding these aspects could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.在文献中没有找到特别说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的相关引述。但是，文献确实强调了h-BN层厚度的重要性，以及通过在堇青石上形成薄层来提高h-BN利用率的作用。虽然没有直接讨论这些位点，特别是1-D边缘活性位点的独特特性和反应机制，但理解这些方面可能有助于设计更高效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
