1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature that directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, or how understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the literature does discuss the preparation and performance of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for ODHP, which exhibits high selectivity and productivity. The catalyst's structure, with a thin h-BN layer on the cordierite, optimizes mass and heat transfer, contributing to its efficiency. Understanding and controlling the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could potentially lead to further improvements in catalyst design for ODHP and other reactions.

1.在文献中没有找到直接说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度性如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能，以及理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，如何有助于设计更有效的催化剂以适应商业应用的相关引文。然而，文献确实讨论了六方氮化硼(h-BN)洗涂的堇青石整体催化剂在ODHP中的制备和性能，该催化剂表现出高选择性和生产力。催化剂的结构，即在堇青石上有一层薄薄的h-BN层，优化了质量和热量的传递，从而提高了其效率。理解和控制活性位点的空间分布和维度性可能有助于进一步改进ODHP和其他反应的催化剂设计。
