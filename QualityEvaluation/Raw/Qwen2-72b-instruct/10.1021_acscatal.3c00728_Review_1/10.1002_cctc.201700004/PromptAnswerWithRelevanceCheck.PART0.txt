Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a metal-free catalyst that shows superior selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with negligible CO2 formation. The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond while avoiding propylene oxidation to CO2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。然而，它确实强调了边缘羟基化氮化硼作为一种无金属催化剂的重要性，它对丙烷氧化脱氢至丙烯具有优越的选择性，CO2的形成可以忽略不计。通过分子氧从BOH基团中抽氢动态生成的活性BNO.位点，通过选择性断裂CH键触发丙烷脱氢，同时避免丙烯氧化为CO2。理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
