1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, and the selectivity is affected by the type of heteroatom and the compound used as the precursor, which lead to different deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on carbon. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露了基面边缘，这些边缘具有更高的缺陷密度，对反应物非常可及。这些缺陷被报告为ODHP的活性相，选择性受杂原子类型和用作前体的化合物的影响，这些会导致碳上非选择性氧化位点的不同失活。理解这些位点，特别是1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
