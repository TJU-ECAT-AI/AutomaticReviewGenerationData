1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, with quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface being selective sites, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. Doping CNFs with B or P enhances the selectivity to propene at isoconversion, and the type of P precursor affects the selectivity to propene. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露了基面边缘，这些边缘具有更高的缺陷密度，这些缺陷对反应物非常可及。据报道，这些缺陷是ODHP中的活性相，碳表面上的醌或二羰基基团是选择性位点，而羧酸对丙烯不具选择性，并促进其双键的完全氧化。用B或P掺杂CNFs可以增强在相同转化率下的丙烯选择性，P前体的类型会影响丙烯的选择性。了解这些位点，特别是1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，可以为设计更高效的催化剂以满足商业应用做出贡献。
