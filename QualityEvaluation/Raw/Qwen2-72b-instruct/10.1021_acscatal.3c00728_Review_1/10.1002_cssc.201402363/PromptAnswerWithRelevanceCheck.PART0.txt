If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which are usually saturated with oxygenated surface groups that are reported to be the active phase in ODHP. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. CNFs doped with B or P provided selectivities to propene higher than that of pristine or oxidized CNFs. The higher selectivities achieved using P- or B-doped CNFs have been explained in terms of P or B reaction with CNT sidewall defects that would suppress the formation of electrophilic O species, which are the cause of the decrease in selectivity.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露了基面边缘，这些边缘通常被饱和的氧化表面基团覆盖，据报道这些基团是ODHP中的活性相。选择性位点被报告为碳表面上的醌或二羰基化合物，而羧酸对丙烯没有选择性，并且有利于其双键的完全氧化。用B或P掺杂的CNFs提供的丙烯选择性高于原始或氧化的CNFs。使用P或B掺杂的CNFs获得的更高选择性被解释为P或B与CNT侧壁缺陷的反应，这会抑制电正性O物种的形成，而这些物种是选择性下降的原因。

However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which have a higher density of defects that are very accessible to reactants. These defects are reported to be the active phase in ODHP, with selective sites being quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. Doping CNFs with B or P enhances the selectivity to propene at isoconversion, with the type of heteroatom and precursor affecting the selectivity. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
