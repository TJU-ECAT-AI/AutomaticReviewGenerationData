1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose the basal plane edges, which are usually saturated with oxygenated surface groups that are reported to be the active phase in ODHP. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favor the complete oxidation of its double bond. CNFs doped with B or P provided selectivities to propene higher than that of pristine or oxidized CNFs. The higher selectivities achieved using P- or B-doped CNFs have been explained in terms of P or B reaction with CNT sidewall defects that would suppress the formation of electrophilic O species, which are the cause of the decrease in selectivity.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露了基面边缘，这些边缘通常被饱和的氧表面基团覆盖，据报道这些基团是ODHP中的活性相。据报道，选择性位点是碳表面上的醌或二羰基化合物，而羧酸对丙烯没有选择性，并促进其双键的完全氧化。用B或P掺杂的CNFs提供的丙烯选择性高于原始或氧化的CNFs。使用P或B掺杂的CNFs获得的更高选择性被解释为P或B与CNT侧壁缺陷的反应，这会抑制电正性O物种的形成，而电正性O物种是选择性下降的原因。
