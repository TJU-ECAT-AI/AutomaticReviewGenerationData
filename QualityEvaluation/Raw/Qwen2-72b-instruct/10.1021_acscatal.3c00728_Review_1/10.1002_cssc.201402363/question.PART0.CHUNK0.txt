Carbon Nanofibers Modified with Heteroatoms as Metal-Free Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Graphical Abstract Turn on, tune in: Doping carbon nanofibers with heteroatoms (B, P, N) tunes the selectivity to the alkene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The selectivity is affected by the type of heteroatom and also by the compound used as the precursor as they lead to different deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on carbon.
Abstract Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source. After calcination, the doped CNFs were used as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied. For the same reaction temperatures and conversions, B- and P-doped CNFs exhibited higher selectivities to propene than pristine CNFs. The N-CNFs were the most active but the least selective of the catalysts tested here. Our results also show that the type of P precursor affects the selectivity to propene and that CNFs modified using triphenylphosphine as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion.
Introduction The chemical industry is based largely on the conversion of alkenes that can be obtained easily and economically from petroleum. As the demand for propene is growing faster than the demand for either ethylene or gasoline, there is a widening gap between propene supply and demand through conventional routes, that is, catalytic (fluid catalytic cracking; FCC) and steam cracking or the direct dehydrogenation of propane. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers an attractive alternative route to propene production as the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct. However, the yield of propene obtained by ODH on most catalysts is limited by alkene oxidation to CO and CO2. The poor selectivity and safety issues, such as the risk of explosion and the formation of hot spots in the catalyst bed, because of the highly exothermic nature of this type of reaction have impeded the industrial implementation of ODH.1 To increase selectivity to alkene, several catalysts have been used in ODH, which include carbon catalysts.2 Even for some non-carbon catalysts, it has been reported that ODH activity is a result of coke deposited at the beginning of reaction.3 Furthermore, increased selectivity in the ODH of n-butane has been reported if B- or P-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used.4 The fact that the surface modification of CNTs can increase the selectivity to alkene has also been reported for the ODH of propane to propene.5 CNTs doped with B or P provided selectivities to propene higher than that of pristine or oxidised CNTs. B-CNTs afforded a high selectivity to propene, that is, 60% selectivity at 5% conversion. A 39% selectivity to propene at 42% conversion along with enhanced stability to oxidation compared to that of undoped carbon nanofibres (CNFs) have been reported if P-CNFs are used.6 The higher selectivities achieved using P- or B-doped CNTs have been explained in terms of P or B reaction with CNT sidewall defects that would suppress the formation of electrophilic O species, which are the cause of the decrease in selectivity5 Recently, N-CNTs have shown an enhanced performance in the ODH of propane.7 Unlike CNTs, which expose graphitic planes to the gas reactants, CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants. These basal plane edges are usually saturated with oxygenated surface groups, which are reported to be the active phase in ODH. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond.5,8,9 CNFs have been used as a catalyst for the ODH of ethylbenzene, in which the graphitic platelet orientation has a significant effect on the catalyst activity and selectivity.10 In that case, the conversion was promoted by enhanced ππ interactions of the ethylbenzene phenyl ring with the carbon basal planes.
In pursuit of the challenging objective to increase the conversion and selectivity to propene by maximising the density of selective sites, here we have prepared CNFs doped with several heteroatoms (B, P, N). The catalysts have been characterised by multiple techniques, and a critical comparison has been made between the performances of CNFs with different dopants and those of similar catalysts reported in the literature.
Results and Discussion Characterisation of CNFs modified with B: Effect of B loading and calcination temperatures Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials. The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2). Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs. This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid.

The thermal stability of the original CNFs and CNFs with different B doping in air is compared in Figure1. The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading. The inhibition of carbon oxidation by modification with B has been studied widely for the preparation of oxidation-resistant carbon/carbon composites used as friction materials in aircraft brakes.11,12 B-CNF samples seem to be stable in air until approximately 873K. The residue after carbon gasification increases slightly as the B content in the CNFs increases, presumably because of residual boron oxide.

In pursuit of the objective to create different B species such as substitutional B or B linked covalently to C atoms, several calcination temperatures were used for 1.5wt%B-CNFs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of B-CNF calcined at 673K shows one peak centred at a binding energy (BE) of 192.7eV (FigureS3). The increase in the B loading from 0.5 to 2% shifted the centre of this peak to only 0.4eV higher BE (Table1). The evolution of the B1s peak as a function of calcination temperature is shown in Figure2. As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases. The increase of the B/C ratio (Table2) as the calcination temperature increases up to 973K also indicates a change in the type of B species such as the formation of oxidic boron clusters on the carbon surface. In parallel, as the calcination temperature increases from 673 to 773K, there is a substantial decrease of the O/C ratio, which can be attributed to the removal of oxygenated species from the CNF surface. A further increase of the temperature does not change the O/C ratio significantly.

Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4. A peak at BE=188.5eV, which is attributed in the literature to substitutional B with three BC bonds, is absent in all the samples. A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms13 isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a). This structure has been predicted to be the most stable because of the steric fit of the terminal O atoms in BO3 with the zig-zag edge C atoms.11,14 The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface (FigureS4b). This explains the significant increase of the B/C ratio after calcination at 973K (Table2). This segregation is logical as the melting point of B2O3 is 723K. It is reported that above the melting point temperature, a glassy residue of polymeric oxide is formed, which blocks active sites on the carbon surface.14 A new peak at BE=191eV (B3) appears for the sample calcined at 973K (9.3%), the intensity of which increases if the sample is calcined at 1173K (31.9%). This peak is attributed in the literature to B species with mixed BC and BO bonds, such the oxycarbides depicted in FigureS4c.13 Testing of B-CNFs for the ODH of propane It is reported that the active phase of carbon materials in ODH are oxygenated surface groups.5 These oxygenated groups are present initially on the CNFs catalyst or are developed during the reaction as demonstrated by an induction period that is absent if the catalyst is pre-treated with diluted O2 at the reaction temperature (FigureS1). The ODH catalytic activity of residual growth catalyst (1wt%) is ruled out for several reasons. First, the residual Ni found by TEM characterisation was always encapsulated. No Ni peak at BE=850eV was found by XPS survey and 2p core-level spectra, which corroborates the absence of Ni at the sample surface. Therefore, both TEM and XPS indicated that the residual Ni metal must be coated fully with carbon and, hence, it is not catalytically active. In addition, we performed an experiment with the growth of a catalyst that contains 20% Ni (20times more Ni than the residual Ni in CNFs) for which the C3H8 conversion was only 2% and the O2 conversion was zero at 673K. Therefore, if there is some residual Ni accessible, its activity is negligible.
The conversion, selectivity and yield to propene in the ODH of propane using the 1.5%B-CNF catalyst calcined at different temperatures are shown in Figure3. Over the catalysts calcined at 973 and 1173K, the propane and O2 conversions decrease significantly and, although the propene selectivity increases slightly, the resulting propene yield decreases dramatically with respect to the samples calcined at temperatures lower than 773K. The decrease of propane conversion for the two catalysts calcined at the highest temperatures can be related to the blockage of oxygenated surface sites for the activation of the reactants, namely, O2 and C3H8. This blockage can occur because boron oxide melts and aggregates to form surface polymeric over-layers for the catalysts calcined at 973K and above. Therefore, the calcination temperature was fixed at 773K for the preparation of subsequent catalysts.

For low reaction temperatures (up to 730K) both propane and O2 conversion are higher for B-free CNF than 2%B-CNF. For instance, a total O2 conversion is achieved at 698K for CNF and at 748K for 2%B-CNF. However, the selectivity is higher for 2%B-CNF in the whole range of temperatures. Accordingly, the propene yield is higher for 2%B-CNF for temperatures above 723K and reaches around 11%, which is quite competitive compared to those obtained with catalysts based on metal oxides.1517 Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Testing in propane ODH at several temperatures using a)CNF or b)2%B-CNF as the catalyst. Left axis: (•) propane conversion, () O2 conversion, () propene selectivity. Right axis: () propene yield. Feed: 60mLmin1 of a mixture of propane/O2/Ar (15:5:80).
The catalyst performance at 698 and 748K as a function of the amount of B on the CNFs is illustrated in Figure5. For the low-temperature experiments, the conversion increases as the B loading increases to 1.5%B-CNF and, concomitantly, the selectivity increases to result in a maximum propene yield if the 1.5%B-CNF catalyst is used. As blank tests with B2O3 showed no activity, the increase of conversion with B doping could be explained because of the increase in surface area and the creation of new oxygenated surface groups upon thermal treatment of the boric acid precursor as demonstrated by the increase of the O/C ratio determined by XPS (Table1). A further increase of the amount of B (2wt%) results in a decreased propane conversion, which occurs in parallel with a decrease of the O2 conversion because of the blockage of the reactant chemisorption sites by an excess of B. This decrease in conversion for 2%B-CNF does not occur at the higher temperature of 748K (Figure5b). As 728K is the melting point of B2O3, it can be argued that it becomes mobile to liberate some surface O groups for O2 activation.

As the best performance was achieved using 1.5%B-CNF and 2%B-CNF at 698 and 748K, respectively, the long-term stability of these catalysts was studied at the corresponding temperature (Figure6). Although the propane conversion and propene yield remains constant at 698K for at least 20h (Figure6a), they decrease after 10h operation at 748K (Figure6b). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) in air demonstrated that B-modified CNF did not burn until 873K (Figure1). Therefore, carbon combustion at 748K cannot be stated unambiguously as the reason for deactivation unless hot spots are produced in the exothermic reaction of H2O formation. XPS spectra of the catalyst after long-term testing (FigureS5) revealed that the B1s peak of the catalyst after reaction at 698K was similar to that before reaction, whereas new peaks at higher BEs were observed after reaction at 748K. As noted above, B2O3 melts at 723K to become mobile and form clusters, which can account for the loss of activity during long-term testing at the highest reaction temperature. In any case, reaction temperatures above 698K should be avoided to guarantee the long-term stability of these catalysts. Consequently, this maximum allowable operation temperature limits the amount of B that can be deposited on CNF because a B excess leads to a decay of conversion at temperatures below 698K.

Comparison of CNF doped with other heteroatoms (P, N) as catalysts for propane ODH The performance of CNFs doped with B, N and P precursors are compared in this section. The same nominal 1.5wt% P loading was impregnated from two precursors, namely, triphenylphosphine and ammonium phosphate, and the catalysts were denoted as 1.5%PTPP-CNF and 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF, respectively. The XPS P2p peaks of P-containing CNF catalysts and the species assigned to each peak are depicted in Figures7 and S6 in the Supporting Information, respectively. The P species present in the catalysts prepared from the two precursors are clearly different. The component with BE=136.0eV is attributed in the literature to P2O5.18 This is the only P species detected for 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF. A peak at BE=133.6134.7eV can be assigned to pentavalent tetracoordinated phosphorous (PO4 tetrahedra).18,19 This later peak is present in 1.5%PTPP-CNF, along with a prevalent peak at a lower BE of 132.5eV, which can be attributed to: (i)the gradual dehydration and condensation of phosphoric acid into polyphosphates or (ii)to the interaction of phosphorous with the aromatic C ring system, for instance, if P is bonded to one or several C atoms.18 Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint P2p XPS peaks of 1.5%PTPP-CNF and 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF.
The P/C and O/C ratios determined by XPS (Table3) are much lower for 1.5%PTPP-CNF than 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF. Partial triphenylphosphine removal from the CNFs surface upon calcination may explain the lower P/C ratio in 1.5%PTPP-CNF. Some white powder was found in the cold outlet part of the calcination reactor, which evidences that the less strongly adsorbed triphenylphosphine evaporates during calcination (triphenylphosphine boiling point: 650K). Triphenylphosphine nominal loadings from 1.55wt% were deposited on CNFs. The P/C ratios determined by XPS after calcination were 0.90.1 irrespective of the initial loading, which indicates that the amount of P species that remain on the CNFs upon calcination reaches a maximum limit. The interaction of the P precursor with CNFs deserves further research. The O/C ratio is approximately half for 1.5%PTPP-CNF, in agreement with the less oxidised nature of the P species.

N-CNFs were prepared by the catalytic decomposition of ethylenediamine on a 20%Fe/Al2O3 catalyst and subsequently purified from the growth catalyst first with NaOH and later with HCl as described in the Experimental Section. TEM micrographs revealed the bamboo-type structure of the N-CNFs, in contrast to the fishbone-type structure of pristine CNFs (FigureS7). XPS analysis of the C and N1s peaks (FigureS8) showed that the N/C ratio of these samples is 3.6%. According to the deconvolution of the N1s peak, the N atoms are of different types (35% pyridinic, 26% pyrrolic, 24% quaternary and 15% pyridine oxide).To compare the selectivities at isoconversion, a different set of experiments was conducted. The maximum reaction temperature was 673K, which is lower than for the experiments shown in the section on the testing of B-CNFs for the ODH of propane. In addition, the O2 concentration was increased to 15% to prevent O2 full conversion. First, the ODH reaction was performed at 673K at different flow rates in the range 20100mLmin1, which gave rise to several contact times and conversions. Later the temperature was decreased in 10K steps, and the reaction was performed again at different flow rates. The propane and O2 conversions increased as reaction temperature was increased and as feed flow rate was decreased (FigureS9). Conversions as a function of the temperature for all the catalysts at selected flow rates for each one to obtain coincident conversions at the same temperature are shown in Figure8a. The selectivities to propene that corresponding to the conversions in Figure8a are shown in Figure8b. The onset of the propane and O2 conversions occurred at much lower temperatures with N-CNF than the other catalysts tested, even for the highest flow rate tested. Except for N-CNF, for the other catalysts it is possible to obtain similar conversions at the same temperatures by using different contact times. Therefore, the selectivities at isoconversion for CNF modified with the different heteroatoms are compared in Figure8b. The selectivity follows the sequence: CNF<1.5%B-CNF<1.5%Pphosphate-CNF<1.5%PTPP-CNF. The highest selectivity to propene (>70%) was achieved with 1.5%PTPP-CNF.Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint a)Propane conversion as a function of reaction temperature for the catalysts using different flow rates to achieve a similar conversion. b)Propene selectivity as a function of reaction temperature that corresponds to the conversions depicted in (a).

Feed: a mixture of propane/O2/Ar (15:15:70).The microstructure of N-CNF, and hence the number of exposed edges, is different to that of CNFs (FigureS7c and d). Therefore, the catalytic performance cannot be attributed just to the presence of N. The N-CNFs prepared here are more active but less selective to propene than pristine CNFs. This contrasts with reported results,7 in which N-CNTs were more selective to propene than undoped CNTs. However, these catalyst have significant differences: (i)N-CNFs prepared here have approximately twice the N content, (ii)pyridinic groups are predominant in our N-CNF, whereas quaternary groups are prevalent in N-CNT prepared in the other work. The work described in Ref.7 shows that a close relationship exists between the amount of quaternary N and C3H6 formation rates. N-doped carbon has been reported to activate O220 and this is stated to be the reason for its outstanding performance as an electrocatalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).21,22 N groups transfer electrons to O2 to form different O species. These species can be of electrophilic character such as superoxide (O2) or peroxide (O22) or nucleophilic (O2). In ODH, the electrophilic species favour the selectivity of the complete oxidation to COx, whereas the nucleophilic species favours the selectivity to C3H6. In ORR, the formation of more electrophilic23 or more nucleophilic oxygen species24 depends on the type of N. Thus, the different types of N dopant could explain the discrepancy in the selectivities to C3H6 achieved if different N-CNFs are used.The catalysts were characterised before and after ODH reaction by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD; FigureS10). The quantification of desorbed CO2 and CO is compiled in Table4. Prior to reaction, N-CNF has a low content of oxygenated groups but a high amount is developed during the ODH. The amount of these groups is comparable to that of the CNF catalyst after reaction. Specifically, the groups that desorb CO2 in N-CNF are increased by a factor of five after reaction. Therefore, C atoms in N-CNF are attacked by O2 to form oxygenated groups, which can contribute to the catalytic activity. It is clear that under the oxidizing conditions of the ODH reaction, oxygenated groups are formed on all the catalysts, so that the significant differences in the amount of oxygenated surface groups of the catalysts before reaction are equilibrated after reaction. After the reaction, all the catalysts had similar amounts of groups that desorb CO and CO2. If there is a subtle difference between the catalysts after reaction, it is that B- and P-modified CNFs have more oxygenated groups than pristine CNFs, presumably because of the higher amount of O linked to the dopant atoms. In addition, the CO/CO2 ratio is larger for B- and P-doped CNFs, which suggests the pivotal role of groups that desorb CO in the catalysis of the selective dehydrogenation to propene in agreement with the literature.5,8 Table 4.

Operation temperatures below 673K not only ensure the long-term stability of the catalyst but also enable the determination of apparent activation energies (FigureS11), which were masked if the reactions were performed at higher temperatures because of diffusional limitations (FigureS12). The apparent activation energies (Ea; Table5) were calculated for the conversions both of O2 and C3H8 lower than 10%. The apparent activation energies of propane conversion increased by around 1730% for all the doped catalysts with respect to pristine CNFs, which suggests that C3H8 activation is hindered slightly after doping. The apparent activation energies of O2 conversion decreased after doping, which indicates that the activation of O2 is enhanced. The decrease of the activation energy of O2 after doping is more pronounced (3060%) than the increase of that of C3H8. Therefore, the doping heteroatom seems to affect the sites for O2 activation to a larger extent. The smaller differences in the C3H8 activation energy suggest that the sites for C3H8 activation have similar nature in all the catalysts, although the sites are not equally selective.

80 103 The different conversions, selectivities and activation energies (especially for O2) that depend on the dopant points to different mechanisms in each case. The nature of N doping is radically different from other dopants as it substitutes C in the graphitic lattice, whereas B- and P-doped CNFs are linked to C through O atoms as confirmed by XPS. Despite the different nature of the N dopant, some insight can be drawn from the comparison of the ODH catalytic performance with N-CNFs or CNFs with the other dopants (B, P). To the best of our knowledge, this comparison is lacking in the literature. It is observed from the results shown in Table4 that O surface groups are also developed on N-CNF during the reaction in amounts comparable to the other catalysts. These active sites are expected to be of a similar nature to the active sites in the other catalysts except for the presence of N in its proximity. Therefore, the significantly higher conversions and lower selectivities obtained using the N-CNF catalyst are likely because of the electronic effects that activate O2. However, upon doping with P and B, the conversion diminishes and selectivity increases, which can be attributed to the inactivation of unselective oxygenated sites, although electronic effects cannot be ruled out completely.
Despite the high selectivity under these conditions, the maximum productivities are around 0.30.4kgkgcat.1h1 (Table5) because of the low conversions attained at temperatures around 673K. The best CNF-based catalyst prepared here has propene yields and mass productivities comparable to the best results reported for other carbonaceous catalysts (Table6). These values do not reach industrial targets, which is a propene yield around 50% and productivity around 1kgkgcat.1h1.1 The maximum yield in the literature is 26% for a V, Mo on SiO2 catalyst, and most catalysts have yields below 20%.1 The maximum reported propene productivity was 1.8kgkgcat.1h1[25] for a vanadia-based catalyst and very recently a strikingly high productivity of 9kgkgcat.1h1 has been reported for V on Ti/SBA-15.26 It would be meaningful for applicability to compare the data of productivities per volume of catalyst, which are not usually reported. Carbon materials have the advantage of their simplicity and that they are the active phase and support at the same time, which can lead to higher activities per volume of catalyst. A higher conversion cannot be reached simply by increasing the reaction temperature because of the stability standpoint and to the occurrence of homogeneous side reactions. The only way to increase the productivity is by increasing the conversion and selectivity for the same catalyst mass at a maximum temperature around 673K to guarantee stable performance. To this end, new C-based catalysts with a high loading of selective sites need to be devised and prepared. This can be accomplished by a precise deactivation of unselective sites with dopant elements or by tailoring the oxygenated groups, which can be accomplished, for example, by exploiting the different thermal stability of the oxygen functionalities.8 In this regard, the triphenylphosphine precursor was more effective to deactivate unselective sites while keeping selective sites active compared to ammonium phosphate or boric acid precursors. Further research should be performed to gain more insight into the interaction between the dopant precursors and unselective oxygen sites. However, the N-CNF catalysts presented here are very promising because the high activity achieved, but more in-depth studies are necessary to ascertain clearly the effect of the type of N and content on propene selectivity. In addition, co-doping with several heteroatoms needs to be researched because of possible synergistic effects.27 Table 6.

At a reaction temperature of 698K, the propene yield is maximised with 1.5wt% B loading. Further B doping decreased the propane conversion as a result of the blockage of reactant activation sites by an excess of B. At higher reaction temperatures, around 730K and above, 2wt% B on CNFs exhibits the highest propene yield, but the performance is not stable in long-term experiments. The pre-treatment of B-CNF at temperatures above 773K has a detrimental effect on conversion because of the blockage of active sites by B2O3 clusters. A CNF catalyst that contained 1.5wt% B calcined at 773K met the optimum compromise in terms of propene yield. For stable performance in long-term experiments, the maximum allowable temperature was 698K. P doping brought about enhanced selectivity at isoconversion compared to B doping. The doping using a triphenylphosphine precursor led to higher propene selectivities than doping using ammonium phosphate. The two precursors gave rise to different P species on CNFs, which are more reduced for the catalyst prepared using triphenylphosphine. On the material prepared from triphenylphosphine, only that adsorbed strongly on the CNF surface is retained upon calcination, whereas that absorbed weakly evaporates in the gas flow. CNFs doped with N groups during their growth were the most active in propane conversion but the least selective to propene. Temperature-programmed desorption indicated that, independent of the initial surface oxygenated groups, new groups are generated during the reaction. Catalysts doped with B and P exhibited larger CO/CO2 ratios after reaction than pristine CNFs, which indicates the crucial role of groups that desorb CO in the selective formation of propene. Some avenues of research are worth exploration in the future, such as increasing the density of pure selective sites, tuning the type of N or co-doping with several heteroatoms.
Experimental Section CNFs were grown on a 20wt% Ni on alumina prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of nickel nitrate on alumina (Pural, Sasol) and calcined at 873K in N2 flow. The powder catalyst was placed on a porous frit in a vertical reactor. After the catalyst was reduced at 823K in 100mLmin1 of H2/N2 mixture (50:50) for 1h, the CNFs growth was performed at 873K in 100mLmin1 of a C2H6/H2 mixture (50:50). The CNFs produced were then purified from the growth catalyst under reflux in NaOH (5M) at 353K for 4h and later with HNO3 (65wt%) under reflux at 353K for 4h. After this purification process, the residual catalyst was less than 1wt% as determined by oxidation up to 800C by using a thermobalance.
B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere. CNFs were also doped with P by incipient wetness impregnation employing triphenylphosphine and ammonium phosphate as precursors. After impregnation, the samples were dried at RT and calcined at 773K. The catalysts were denoted as 1.5%PTPP-CNF and 1.5%Pphosphate-CNF, respectively.
N-CNF were grown on a 20wt% Fe on alumina catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of iron nitrate on alumina (Pural, Sasol) and calcined at 873K in a N2 flow. The catalyst was reduced at 823K for 1h in a flow of 100mLmin1 of a H2/N2 (50:50) mixture. Subsequently, the reactor was heated to the CNF growth temperature (1023K) under Ar. After reaching the temperature, the reaction mixture was fed, which consisted of 100mLmin1 Ar measured with flow controller mixed with 0.15mLmin1 of ethylendiamine (10mL in total) fed using a syringe. The reaction mixture passed through an evaporator at 200C and a heated line to the reactor that contained the growth catalyst. The N-CNFs were purified from the growth catalyst under reflux in NaOH (5M) for 4h at 353K and later under reflux in HCl at 373K for another 4h. After this purification process, the residual catalyst content was less than 1wt% as determined by oxidation by using a thermobalance.
The CNF-based catalysts produced were then characterised by XPS. The XPS system used was an ESCAPlus Omnicrom equipped with a MgKα radiation source to excite the sample. Calibration of the instrument was performed with the Ag3d5/2 line at BE=368.27eV. All measurements were performed under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), better than 1010Torr. The spectrometer energies were performed internally using the C1s signal at BE=284.6eV. The curve fitting of the spectra was performed using CASA XPS software after applying a Shirley baseline. For peak deconvolution, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was fixed to be equal for all the peaks and with a maximum value of BE=2.5eV.
The specific surface area was measured by N2 adsorption using the BET method in the relative pressure range 0.010.10 following the ASTM-4365 standard by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at 77K. The pore size distribution was estimated by the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch. TEM images of CNFs were collected with by using a FEI TECNAI F30 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Energy Filter and a cold field-emission gun (FEG) operated at 300kV with 1.5Å lattice resolution. Specimens for TEM characterisation were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the CNFs in ethanol. A drop of the suspension was deposited onto a holey carbon support grid.
TPO was performed in air by using a SETARAM Setsys Evolution thermobalance under an air flow of 100mLmin1 from RT to 1073K at a heating rate of 10Kmin1. TPD of the catalysts before and after ODH was measured in a 6mm diameter vertical quartz tube. Ar was used as carrier gas (50mLmin1) heated at a rate of 10Kmin1 to 1273K. The outlet gases were analysed by using a Pfeiffer quadrupole mass spectrometer.
Catalytic testing in ODH was performed in a continuous-flow 6mm i.d. quartz reactor inside a vertical furnace with a temperature controller (Eurotherm). Catalyst (130mg) diluted in SiC was placed on quartz wool inside the reactor. The reaction temperature was controlled with a thermocouple inside the catalytic bed. The ODH reaction was performed using a mixture of propane/O2/Ar (15:5:80). Because O2 was depleted at the highest temperatures, a composition of 15:15:70 was used to compare the selectivities and calculate the activation energies. The total flow rate was varied from 20100mLmin1. The reaction was first performed at the highest temperature and, subsequently, the temperature was reduced stepwise. The conversions and selectivities reported were measured at steady state because an induction period was observed at the first temperature tested (FigureS1). The outlet reaction gases were analysed with by using an Agilent Micro GC 3000A. H2, O2, CO and CH4 were analysed in a molsieve column, CO2 in a Plot-Q column, and propane and propene in an alumina column. To ensure repeatability, two or three separate GC samples were taken and averaged for each experimental data point. In all ODH testing, the carbon balances of all analysed gases were close to the 1003%, which rules out either carbon products accumulated on the catalyst or the gasification of carbon. As an example of typical product distribution using CNF as the catalyst at 673K, a propane conversion of 6.6% was achieved and the products were C3H8 (58.5%), CH4 (0.36%), C2H6 (2.5%), CO (9.9%) and CO2 (26%).
