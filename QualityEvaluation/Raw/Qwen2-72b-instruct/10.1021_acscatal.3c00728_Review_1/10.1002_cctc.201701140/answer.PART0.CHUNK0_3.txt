1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The literature also indicates that the crystal structure of the material may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active-site density, which could affect the formation of BOx species during ODH. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实表明活性位点可能是所有测试的硼化物催化剂表面形成的表面稳定的BOx位点。文献还指出，材料的晶体结构可能会影响表面氧化的程度和活性位点的密度，这可能会影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成。层状硼化物，如NiB，TiB2和hBN，可能具有与WB和Co2B等四方硼化物不同的硼表面浓度，这将影响BOx物种的形成。
