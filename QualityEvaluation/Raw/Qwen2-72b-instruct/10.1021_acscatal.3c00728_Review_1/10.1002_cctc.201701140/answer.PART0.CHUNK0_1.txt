1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The literature also indicates that the crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实表明活性位点可能是所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成的表面稳定的BOx位点。文献还指出，材料的晶体结构可能会影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成，这可能会影响活性位点的密度。
