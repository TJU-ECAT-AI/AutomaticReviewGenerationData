          The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites might involve boron-oxygen coordination, which plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure. The active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.

          文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实表明这些催化剂的活性位点可能涉及硼-氧配位，这在ODHP反应中起着关键作用。元素硼和含硼材料之间的反应性差异可能是由于活性位点密度和表面BOx物种与次表面体结构之间的电子相互作用造成的。活性位点可能是所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成的表面稳定的BOx位点。文献还指出，材料的晶体结构可能会影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成，这可能会影响活性位点的密度。层状硼化物，如NiB，TiB2和hBN，可能具有与WB和Co2B等四方硼化物不同的硼表面浓度，这将影响BOx物种的形成。
