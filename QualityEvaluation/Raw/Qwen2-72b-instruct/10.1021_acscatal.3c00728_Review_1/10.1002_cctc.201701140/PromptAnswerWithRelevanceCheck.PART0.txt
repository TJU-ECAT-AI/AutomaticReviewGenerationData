Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites of these catalysts might involve boron-oxygen coordination, which plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be due to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实表明这些催化剂的活性位点可能涉及硼-氧配位，这在ODHP反应中起着关键作用。元素硼和含硼材料之间的反应性差异可能是由于活性位点密度和表面BOx物种与次表面体结构之间的电子相互作用造成的。

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does suggest that the active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The literature also indicates that the crystal structure of the material may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH, which could affect the active-site density.

However, it does suggest that the active sites are likely surface-stabilized BOx sites that form on all tested boride catalysts. The literature also indicates that the crystal structure of the material may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active-site density, which could affect the formation of BOx species during ODH. Layered borides such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides like WB and Co2B, which would impact the formation of BOx species.
