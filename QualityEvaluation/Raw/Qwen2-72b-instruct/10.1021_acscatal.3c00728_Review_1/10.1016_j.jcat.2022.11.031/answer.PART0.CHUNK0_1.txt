1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of the defective sites and large porosity in the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst, which improves olefin and propylene selectivity. The H-bonded BOH groups in the defect tri-coordination boron species are identified as the active center for the activation of propane and triggering the gas-phase reactions. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, resulting in higher reaction order of propane and boosting the propylene selectivity.

1.文献没有提供硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实强调了胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石(EBZ)催化剂中缺陷位点和大孔隙度的重要性，这提高了烯烃和丙烯的选择性。缺陷三配位硼物种中的H键合BOH基团被鉴定为激活丙烷和触发气相反应的活性中心。气相反应的增强贡献促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷反应级数的提高，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。
