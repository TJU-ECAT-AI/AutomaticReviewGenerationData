Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of the defective sites and large porosity in the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst, which improves olefin and propylene selectivity. The H-bonded BOH groups in the defect tri-coordination boron species are identified as the active center for the activation of propane and triggering the gas-phase reactions. The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, resulting in higher reaction order of propane and boosting the propylene selectivity.

1.文献没有提供硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实强调了胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石(EBZ)催化剂中缺陷位点和大孔隙度的重要性，这提高了烯烃和丙烯的选择性。缺陷三配位硼物种中的H键合BOH基团被鉴定为激活丙烷和触发气相反应的活性中心。气相反应的增强贡献促进了丙烷的活化，导致丙烷反应级数的提高，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。
