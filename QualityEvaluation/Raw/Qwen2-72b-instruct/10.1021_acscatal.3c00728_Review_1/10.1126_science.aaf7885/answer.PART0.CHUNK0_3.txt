[1] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

1.The high olefin selectivity observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions using boron nitride (BN) catalysts is attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. The one-dimensional (1D) nature of the edge active sites in BN catalysts prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals, which is common in zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, which typically occurs on two-dimensional (2D) surface catalysts. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by avoiding the creation of highly reactive intermediates and suppressing overoxidation.

1.在使用硼氮化物(BN)催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中观察到的高烯烃选择性归因于硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定作用。硼氮化物催化剂中1D边缘活性位点的性质避免了高度反应性的丙基自由基的形成,这是0D单点催化剂的典型特征,同时也抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化,这是2D表面催化剂的典型特征。理解这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更有效的催化剂,用于商业应用,避免产生高度反应性的中间体,并抑制过度氧化。
