How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?

[1] "The exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction to generate propene has the potential to be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "A supported vanadia on silica catalyst (V/SiO2) was used in this work to make direct comparisons with the catalytic performance of BN."
[4] "The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the facile overoxidation of propene to COx."
[5] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts."
[6] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[7] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[8] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[9] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, typical of 0D single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical of 2D surface catalysts. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by improving selectivity to olefins and controlling the reaction kinetics, leading to higher propene productivity and stability.

1.The high olefin selectivity observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions using boron nitride (BN) catalysts is attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. The one-dimensional (1D) nature of the BN edge active sites prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals, which are common in zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, a typical issue with two-dimensional (2D) surface catalysts. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by avoiding the creation of highly reactive intermediates and preventing overoxidation, thus enhancing selectivity and efficiency.

1.在使用硼氮化物(BN)催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中观察到的高烯烃选择性归因于硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定作用。BN边缘活性位点的一维(1D)特性避免了高度反应性的丙基自由基的形成,这是零维(0D)单点催化剂的常见现象,同时也抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化,这是二维(2D)表面催化剂的典型问题。理解这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对于商业应用中设计更高效催化剂的贡献在于,避免了高度反应性中间体的产生,防止了过度氧化,从而提高了选择性和效率。
