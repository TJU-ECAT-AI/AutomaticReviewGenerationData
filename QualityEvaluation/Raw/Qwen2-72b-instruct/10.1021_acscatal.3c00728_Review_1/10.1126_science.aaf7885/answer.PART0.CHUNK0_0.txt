[1] "The exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction to generate propene has the potential to be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "A supported vanadia on silica catalyst (V/SiO2) was used in this work to make direct comparisons with the catalytic performance of BN."
[4] "The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the facile overoxidation of propene to COx."
[5] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts."
[6] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[7] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[8] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[9] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, typical of 0D single-site catalysts, and also suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, typical of 2D surface catalysts. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by improving selectivity to olefins and controlling the reaction kinetics, leading to higher propene productivity and stability.

1.B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1D）对其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能有重大影响。BN的氧终止扶手椅边缘（>BOON<）的1D性质避免了0D单点催化剂中常见的高活性丙基自由基的产生，同时也抑制了2D表面催化剂中吸附物种的过度氧化。这一独特性质通过提高烯烃选择性和控制反应动力学，提高了丙烯生产力和稳定性，从而为商业应用设计更高效的催化剂做出了贡献。
