[1] "The exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction to generate propene has the potential to be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "The observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[4] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1D nature of the edge active sites in boron nitride materials prevents the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, leading to high olefin selectivity. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
