1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are remarkably selective towards propene formation in the ODH of propane. The modification with borate and phosphate is reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures. The protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40kJmol1 higher activation energy of O2 conversion. The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt%, thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active. The propene selectivity increases from 17% to 28% whereas the overall reaction rate decreases from 4.3 to 3.2mmolg1h1, resulting in an improved production of propene of up to 18%. The maximum productivity of propene was found at a B2O3 loading of 0.01wt%. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，硼氧化物改性的碳纳米管(CNTs)在丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)中对丙烯的形成具有显著的选择性。据报道，用硼酸盐和磷酸盐的改性会阻塞作为气体氧气攻击点的燃烧位点，从而在高温下抑制碳框架的燃烧。硼氧化物改性的保护作用对O2活化的影响反映在O2转化的活化能大约高40kJmol1。对于0.003wt%的负载，观察到了硼氧化物的影响，这清楚地表明，通过应用的表征技术检测到的表面功能中，只有微不足道的部分是催化活性的。丙烯的选择性从17%增加到28%，而总反应速率从4.3减少到3.2mmolg1h1，结果是丙烯的产量提高了18%。在0.01wt%的B2O3负载下，发现了丙烯的最大生产力。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，可以为商业应用设计更有效的催化剂做出贡献。
