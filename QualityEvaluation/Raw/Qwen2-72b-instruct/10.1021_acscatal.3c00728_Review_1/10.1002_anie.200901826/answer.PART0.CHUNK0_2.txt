1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention that boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are remarkably selective towards propene formation in the ODH of propane. The modification with borate and phosphate is reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures. The protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40kJmol1 higher activation energy of O2 conversion. The effect of boron oxide was observed for a loading as low as 0.003wt%, thus clearly demonstrating that only a negligible fraction of surface functionalities detected by the applied characterization techniques are catalytically active. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有具体说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。但是，它确实提到硼氧化物改性的碳纳米管(CNTs)在丙烷的ODH中对丙烯的形成具有显著的选择性。据报道，用硼酸盐和磷酸盐的改性会阻塞作为气体氧气攻击点的燃烧位点，从而在高温下抑制碳框架的燃烧。硼氧化物改性的保护作用体现在O2转化的激活能大约高40kJmol1。在低至0.003wt%的硼氧化物负载下观察到了硼氧化物的作用，这清楚地表明，通过应用的表征技术检测到的表面功能中，只有微不足道的部分是催化活性的。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
