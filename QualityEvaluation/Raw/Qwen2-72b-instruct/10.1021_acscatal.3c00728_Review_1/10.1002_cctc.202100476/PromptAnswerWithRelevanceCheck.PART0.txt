1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its fibrous microstructure and varying h-BN loadings, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The uniform dispersion of h-BN on the SiO2 support and the chemical structure of the nanofiber catalysts before and after calcination were investigated. The XRD patterns confirmed the presence of h-BN in the catalysts. The catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with different h-BN loadings was investigated, showing increased propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature and h-BN loading. A controlled experiment using exfoliated h-BN powder as a catalyst demonstrated the superior activity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, attributed to the one-dimensional structure that facilitates active site exposure and higher conversion. The catalyst stability was evaluated, showing stable propane conversion and selectivity of propylene and ethylene. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst achieved a high productivity of olefins, significantly higher than that of bulk h-BN catalysts and most reported boron-based catalysts. This indicates that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibits better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
