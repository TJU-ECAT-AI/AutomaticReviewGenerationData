1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate substance transmission and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed excellent performance in the ODHP reaction, with high propylene productivity. The one-dimensional structure of the nanofiber catalyst, with well-dispersed h-BN, improves catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions by enhancing mass transfer and exposing active sites more easily. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
