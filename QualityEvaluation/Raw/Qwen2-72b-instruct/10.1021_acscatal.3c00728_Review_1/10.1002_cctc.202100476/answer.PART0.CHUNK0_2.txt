1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites, have attracted considerable attention in catalysis. The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted, and the good interaction between nanoparticles and the support ensures the activity, selectivity, and long-term stability of the catalyst. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional structure, facilitates active site exposure, leading to higher conversion rates and better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
