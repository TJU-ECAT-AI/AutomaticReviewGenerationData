[14] "The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion."

[15] "To illustrate the role of the one-dimensional structure of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst on the activity, a controlled experiment was performed by using exfoliated h-BN powder as catalyst."

[16] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

1.The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, have attracted attention due to their ability to facilitate the transmission of substances and expose highly active sites. The electrospinning method allows for the easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of nanofibers, ensuring good interaction between nanoparticles and the support, which further enhances activity, selectivity, and long-term stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional fibrous structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN, exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with a remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst and the effect of h-BN loading were investigated, showing that the average diameter of the nanofibers increased with h-BN loading. The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping confirmed the uniform dispersion of h-BN on the SiO2 support. The chemical structure and XRD patterns of the nanofiber catalysts were analyzed, revealing the presence of h-BN and its effect on the amorphous structure of SiO2. The catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with different h-BN loadings was investigated, showing that propane conversion increased with reaction temperature and h-BN loading. A controlled experiment using exfoliated h-BN powder as a catalyst demonstrated the superior activity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, attributed to the one-dimensional structure facilitating active site exposure. The catalyst stability was evaluated, showing that propane conversion and selectivity stabilized over time, with no change in catalyst weight, indicating superior stability. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst achieved a high productivity of olefins, significantly higher than that of bulk h-BN catalysts and most reported boron-based catalysts, due to enhanced mass transfer allowing active sites to be easily exposed.
