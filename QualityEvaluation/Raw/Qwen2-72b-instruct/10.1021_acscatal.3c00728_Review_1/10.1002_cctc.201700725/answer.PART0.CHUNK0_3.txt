1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge B atoms in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on boron nitride nanosheets. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, and BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane. These sites serve as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, and the dehydrogenation circle is completed over these BO sites by the assistance of O2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。然而，它确实强调了在硼氮化物纳米片上乙烷氧化脱氢中边缘B原子的重要性。边缘B原子参与O2的活化，通过乙烷的帮助，在BN的边缘形成BO(H)活性位点。这些位点作为乙烷氧化脱氢的活性位点，通过O2的辅助，脱氢循环在这些BO位点上完成。理解这些位点，特别是1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
