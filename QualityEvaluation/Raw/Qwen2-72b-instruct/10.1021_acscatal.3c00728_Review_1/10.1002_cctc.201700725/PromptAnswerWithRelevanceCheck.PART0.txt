1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge active sites in boron nitride (BN) materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The edge B atoms of BN nanosheets are involved in O2 activation, and BO(H) active sites are formed at these edges, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these edge active sites could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
