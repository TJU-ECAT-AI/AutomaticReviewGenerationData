1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge B atoms in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on boron nitride nanosheets. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, and BO(H) active sites are formed at the BN edges by the aid of ethane. These sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实强调了在硼氮化物纳米片上乙烷氧化脱氢中边缘B原子的重要性。边缘B原子参与O2活化，BN边缘在乙烷的帮助下形成BO(H)活性位点。这些位点可以在O2的帮助下从乙烷中提取一个氢原子。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
