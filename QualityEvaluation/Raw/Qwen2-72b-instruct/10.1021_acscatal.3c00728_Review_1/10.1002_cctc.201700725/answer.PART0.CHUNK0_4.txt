1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does highlight the importance of edge active sites in boron nitride (BN) materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The edge B atoms of BN nanosheets are involved in O2 activation, and BO(H) active sites are formed at the edges by the aid of ethane. These sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2, leading to the production of ethylene. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these edge active sites could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度(1-D, 2-D, 3-D)如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的具体信息。但是，它确实强调了BN材料中边缘活性位点在乙烷氧化脱氢中的重要性。BN纳米片的边缘B原子参与O2的活化，BO(H)活性位点在乙烷的帮助下在边缘形成。这些位点可以在O2的协助下从乙烷中提取一个氢原子，从而产生乙烯。理解这些边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制可能有助于设计更有效的催化剂，用于商业应用。
