1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support, which can be seen as related to tandem catalysis. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that by combining multiple reaction steps on a single catalyst, the overall process can be simplified, potentially leading to higher energy efficiency and better process optimization. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is not mentioned in the context of coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.

1.纳米尺度上的串联催化概念在提供的文献中没有直接涉及。但是，文献确实讨论了双金属催化剂的使用以及在单一载体上结合不同的催化功能，这可以被视为与串联催化相关。对于能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响没有明确说明，但可以推断，通过在单一催化剂上结合多个反应步骤，可以简化整个过程，可能带来更高的能源效率和更好的过程优化。In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂没有在催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧的耦合中提及。
