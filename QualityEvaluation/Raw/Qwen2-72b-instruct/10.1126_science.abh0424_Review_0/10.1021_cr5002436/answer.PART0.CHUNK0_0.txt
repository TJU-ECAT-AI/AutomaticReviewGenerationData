1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The synergistic effect of these bimetallic catalysts can be seen as a form of tandem catalysis, where the two metals work together to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is not specifically mentioned, but the literature does highlight the importance of designing catalysts with specific properties to control side reactions and optimize the dehydrogenation process. The use of such catalysts can lead to higher energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts and increasing the yield of the desired olefins.

1.纳米尺度上的串联催化概念在提供的文献中没有直接涉及。但是，文献确实讨论了用于轻烷烃脱氢的双金属催化剂，如PtSn。这些双金属催化剂的协同效应可以被视为一种串联催化，其中两种金属协同工作以增强催化活性和选择性。In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧没有特别提及，但文献确实强调了设计具有特定性质的催化剂以控制副反应和优化脱氢过程的重要性。使用此类催化剂可以通过减少不需要的副产品的形成和增加所需烯烃的产量来提高能源效率和过程优化。
