1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support, which can be considered a form of tandem catalysis. For example, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst combines the dehydrogenation activity of In2O3 with the hydrogen combustion activity of Pt, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization by coupling two reaction steps on a single catalyst. This approach can lead to more efficient use of reactants and energy, as well as better control over product selectivity and yield.

1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The synergistic effect of these bimetallic catalysts can be seen as a form of tandem catalysis, where the two metals work together to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is not specifically mentioned, but the literature does highlight the importance of designing catalysts with specific properties to control side reactions and optimize the dehydrogenation process. The use of such catalysts can lead to higher energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts and increasing the yield of the desired olefins.

1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Al2O3, where the Pt and Sn components work in tandem to optimize the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The Pt component catalyzes the dehydrogenation reaction, while the Sn component suppresses side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization, and facilitates the redispersion of Pt after regeneration. This tandem action at the nanoscale can improve energy efficiency and process optimization by increasing selectivity to the desired olefin product and reducing the need for catalyst regeneration. Similarly, the use of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be optimized by the addition of alkali metal promoters, which stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance and selectivity. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is not specifically discussed in the literature, but the principles of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale can be applied to understand how the In2O3 and Pt components work together to optimize the overall process.
