Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and staged O2 introduction for selective H2 removal
Abstract
Small Pt clusters within Na-[Fe]ZSM5-protected channels catalyze C3H8 and C2H6 dehydrogenation with unprecedented turnover rates and catalyst stability. Alkene selectivities are greater than 97% at near-equilibrium alkane conversions. Mild oxidative treatments fully restored initial catalytic rates and selectivities. Exchange sites in Na-[Fe]ZSM5 lead to well-dispersed Pt precursors and catalytic Pt clusters, which reside within ZSM5 channels that inhibit the formation of large unreactive organic residues. The weak acidity of residual OH groups in [Fe]ZSM5 minimizes β-scission and oligomerization reactions, which lead to loss of alkene selectivity and to unreactive organic residues. Thermodynamic constraints were removed by selective combustion of H2 using O2 coreactants. More than 90% of the O2 introduced was used to form H2O from H2, even when hydrocarbons were the predominant available reactants. Equivalent O2 amounts cofed with C3H8 reactants led instead to ∼5% selectivity for H2 combustion. Hydrocarbon combustion was the predominant reaction and the cofed O2 was depleted before H2 could be formed and dehydrogenation approached equilibrium. Alkene yield enhancements of ∼1.6 above equilibrium were achieved by selective H2 removal using O2 staging. These yield enhancements exceed those achieved with previously reported three-stage reactor systems. The O2 staging approach reported here requires only one reactor and one catalytic composition; thus, it decreases significantly process complexity and cost. H2 removal by selective combustion using O2 requires precise control of O2 introduction and availability in order to avoid H2 depletion and high CO selectivities, which can lead to unreactive deposits and to catalyst deactivation during alkane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
The selective conversion of light alkanes to alkenes provides an attractive route to useful chemicals 
[1]
. Several alkane dehydrogenation processes 
[2]
, 
[3]
, 
[4]
, 
[5]
, 
[6]
 use supported Cr oxide catalysts. Recently developed dehydrogenation processes are based on supported Pt catalysts 
[2]
, 
[3]
, 
[4]
, 
[5]
, 
[6]
. Both Pt and Cr catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent oxidative regenerations, which increase process complexity and capital and operating costs. Alkene yields are often limited by thermodynamics and the resulting low conversions introduce significant recycle and separation costs.

Dehydrogenation catalysts must increase the rate of desired reactions while minimizing side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, as well as the formation of unreactive carbon residues. Pt/Al2O3 is active in dehydrogenation reactions 
[1]
, 
[7]
, but deactivates rapidly via formation of unsaturated organic residues. Pt clusters supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 
[7]
, 
[8]
, 
[9]
, L-zeolite 
[10]
, and MgAl2O4 
[11]
 and modified with Sn give lower cracking, isomerization, and coke formation rates 
[1]
, 
[12]
, 
[13]
. Sn and Pt appear to mix as small bimetallic clusters 
[14]
, which are better dispersed and more stable than Pt/γ-Al2O3 
[7]
, but C3H8 dehydrogenation rates (30 kPa, 792 K) still decrease rapidly during reaction.

High H2 concentrations limit alkene product yields by increasing the rate of the reverse reactions. In contrast, alkene yields are not thermodynamically limited in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, because H-atoms formed in CH bond activation steps are directly removed as H2O. Alkene yields in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are limited, however, by parallel and sequential oxidation reactions to form CO and CO2 
[15]
, 
[16]
, 
[17]
, 
[18]
, 
[19]
, 
[20]
, 
[21]
. Thermodynamic constraints in alkane dehydrogenation can be removed by continuously removing H2 using membranes 
[22]
, 
[23]
 or selective reactions with coreactants, such as O2 
[24]
, 
[25]
. The latter approach differs mechanistically from oxidative dehydrogenation, because H2 reacts with O2 after it desorbs, possibly on sites different from those used in dehydrogenation steps.

Here, we report a novel alkane dehydrogenation catalyst prepared by exchange of small amounts of Pt (0.1 wt% Pt) onto Na-[Fe]ZSM5 
[26]
. These materials give high C3H6 selectivity (>97%), very high reaction rates, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability. Deactivation rate constants are more than 10 times smaller than on previously reported Pt–Sn catalysts 
[7]
. Staged introduction of O2 coreactants during C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation led to selective combustion of H2 products and to the substantial removal of thermodynamic constraints.

2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization
Na-[Fe]ZSM5 was prepared using methods previously described 
[27]
. [Fe]ZSM5 was treated in flowing dry air (
) at 723 K for 15 h to remove organic templates used in its synthesis. This sample was exchanged three times with a NaNO3 solution (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%, 0.5 liter/g-zeolite of a 2 g/liter NaNO3 solution) at 353 K for 15 h and then filtered and washed with deionized water (2 liter/g ZSM5) to obtain Na-[Fe]ZSM5. Na-[Fe]ZSM5 was treated in flowing dry air (
) at 723 K for 15 h in order to remove residual nitrates. Pt cations were introduced by ion exchange with 0.001 M Pt(NH4)4(NO3)2 (Johnson Matthey/Aesar) for 12 h at 353 K. Exchanged samples were filtered, washed with deionized water, and treated in flowing dry air (
) at 723 K for 12 h. Si, Fe, and Pt contents were measured by atomic emission methods; they were 0.10 wt%. Pt and 0.44 wt% Fe{(Si/Fe)at=200}. Al was present in trace amounts (0.03 wt%). The fractional Pt dispersion was 0.95; it was obtained from the uptake of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen at 293 K, after samples were dried in He (
) at 573 K for 1 h and reduced at 573 K in H2 (
) for 2 h.

2.2. Catalytic reaction rates and selectivities
Reaction rates and selectivities were measured using a packed-bed with plug-flow hydrodynamics and a gradientless recirculating reactor operated in either batch or semibatch mode 
[28]
. In plug-flow mode, rate data were obtained at 793 K, 25 kPa C3H8/He (Praxair, certified mixture), and 4.1–78.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocities. Catalysts (0.03 g) were treated in 40% H2/He (Airgas, UHP, 
) at 773 K before rate measurements.

In recirculating mode, rates were measured for C3H8 (5 or 20 kPa, Praxair) at 723 K and for C2H6 (20 kPa, Scott Specialty Gases, Inc.) at 773 K using the following protocols:

(i)
Pure alkane reactants.

(ii)
Staged feed mode: Alkanes were introduced at the start of each experiment and O2 (Scott Specialty Gases, 99.999%) was added continuously using a 60-m quartz capillary (HP, 0.25-mm diameter). O2 introduction rates (0.053–0.28 mol/(g-atom Pt s)) were chosen based on average H2 formation rates during alkane reactions (without O2); they were controlled by varying upstream capillary pressures; the O2 staging protocols used are described in 
Table 1
.

Table 1. O2 staging protocols during alkane dehydrogenation reactions on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 in a gradientless batch reactor

(a) 20 kPa C3H8 at 723 K	Contact time (ks)	0–0.3	0.3–2.4	2.4–6.6

O2 introduction rate (mol/(g-atom Pt s))	0	0.053	–
(c) 20 kPa C2H6 at 773 K	Contact time (ks)	0–0.3	0.3–0.7	0.7–4.3
O2 introduction rate (mol/(g-atom Pt s))	0	0.28	0.14
(iii)
Cofeed mode: C3H8 (20 kPa, Praxair, CP) and O2 (4 kPa) (Scott Specialty Gases, Inc., 99.999%) were concurrently added at the start of experiment.


O2 staging intensities are defined as O2 introduction rates divided by the corresponding rates required to consume all H2 formed during an equivalent O2-free alkane dehydrogenation experiment, if O2 molecules were introduced at a uniform rate during staged O2 experiments. A staging intensity of unity corresponds to O2 addition rates of 0.16 mol/(g-atom Pt s) for 20 kPa C3H8 reactants at 723 K, 0.050 mol/g-atom Pt s) for 5 kPa C3H8 at 723 K, and 0.14 mol/(g-atom Pt s) for 20 kPa C2H6 at 773 K. These O2 introduction rates would lead to the ultimate consumption of all H2 produced during each experiment, when O2 is used only to form H2O and when the amounts of alkenes and H2 produced are similar in O2-free and staged O2 experiments. Both assumptions represent approximations, but staging intensities remain a useful descriptive measure of O2 introduction rates.

Reactants were introduced into the recirculating reactor volume (520 cm3) after evacuation to <0.1 Pa. A graphite gear pump was used to circulate reactor contents at >2 cm3/s in order to ensure gradientless operation (<1% alkane conversion per pass). Catalysts were treated in 40% H2/He (Airgas, UHP, 
) at 773 K for 1 h before reaction. During the initial stages of reaction (0.5–1.0 h) alkene selectivities increased because of selective deactivation of acid sites that formed C1 and C2 products. Therefore, samples were exposed to C3H8 at 773 K and 18.6 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity for 2 h in continuous flow mode before batch or semibatch mode experiments in order to ensure steady-state catalytic rates and selectivities. Reactant and product concentrations were measured by on-line gas chromatography (Hewlett Packard, Model 5890) using capillary (HP-1 methyl silicone column, 50 m, 320 μm) and packed (Supelco, 1000 Carboxen) columns and flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. Samples were collected using a valve located within the recirculation loop.

Plug-flow reactor rates are reported as moles of reactant consumed or product formed per g-atom Pt-s. Product concentrations in recirculating modes are given as site yields [(moles of reactant converted to a given product)/(g-atom Pt)]; the slope of such plots gives reaction rates in terms similar to those used for flow reactor data. Hydrocarbon selectivities are reported on a carbon basis as the percentage of the converted reactant appearing as a given reaction product. Oxygen selectivities are also reported for O2 introduction experiments; they are defined as the percentage of the O2 introduced that is used for H2 combustion to form H2O or for hydrocarbon combustion to form COx (CO and CO2) and the stoichiometric amount of H2O.

Lund and co-workers 
[29]
 previously described a mathematical analogy between H2 removal during dehydrogenation reactions in batch and flow membrane reactors. A similar analysis supports a rigorous mathematical analogy between semibatch reactors with continuous O2 feed and plug-flow reactors with multiple axial injection points (or O2-permeable walls) 
[30]
. Thus, the continuous O2 introduction experiments described here provide a rigorous description of the effects of O2 introduction along tubular dehydrogenation reactors.

The influence of reverse reactions on measured alkane dehydrogenation rates must be taken into account, especially as the reaction approaches equilibrium, in order to determine kinetically relevant forward reaction rates. The approach to equilibrium (η) depends on thermodynamic data and on the prevalent pressures of reactants and products:
(1)
The equilibrium constant KEQ was obtained from literature data 
[31]
. The value of (1−η) represents the fractional distance from equilibrium. Net reaction rates can then be rigorously expressed as
(2)
from which forward rates can be obtained:
(3)

The effects of contact time of C3H8 dehydrogenation rates were described using the set of reactions shown in 
Scheme 1
. Rate and selectivity data were used to estimate each rate constant assuming pseudo-first-order kinetics for forward reactions and thermodynamic relations for all reverse rate constants. The linear set of differential equations was solved using known methods 
[32]
; a regression analysis was used to minimize deviations between model predictions and experimental data.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 in a packed-bed plug-flow reactor
C3H8 dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were measured on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst at 793 K, 25 kPa C3H8, and 4.1–78.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity in a plug-flow reactor (
Table 2
). The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 under these conditions is ∼36%. This catalyst led to near-equilibrium C3H6 yields (35%) with 97% C3H6 selectivity, and a net C3H6 formation turnover rate of 1.4 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) at 4.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity. These net rates are similar to those reported (1.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) at 792 K and slightly lower space velocities (3.5 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)) on 0.35 wt% Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3; these previously reported rates, however, decreased rapidly with time on stream 
[7]
. Measured C3H6 formation rates on 0.1 wt%. Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 decreased with increasing residence time (
Table 2
, 
Fig. 1
), as the dehydrogenation reaction approached equilibrium. The effects of residence time on forward reaction rates, obtained from the measured net rates using 
Eq. (3)
, are much weaker (
Fig. 1
); they merely reflect C3H8 depletion by reaction and the observed first-order dependence of forward dehydrogenation rates on C3H8 pressure.

C3H6 selectivities decreased slightly with increasing residence time, because hydrogenolysis and cracking remained far from equilibrium as dehydrogenation reactions approached equilibrium with increasing residence time. Even at C3H8 conversions near equilibrium (∼35%), C3H6 selectivities were very high (97%), as also found on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 (95–98%) 
[7]
. C2H4/C2H6 ratios were higher than thermodynamic values and decreased with increasing residence time (
Table 2
); these data indicate that C2H6 forms via hydrogenation of C2H4 formed in primary cracking reactions. Direct formation of C2H6 via hydrogenolysis of C3H8 was not detected, consistent with the structure sensitivity of these reactions and the low turnover rates reported on highly dispersed Pt clusters 
[33]
. Only traces of C6–C8 aromatics (<1% selectivity) were detected, suggesting that residual acid sites (formed during reduction of exchanged Pt cations) are relatively inactive in oligomerization and cyclization reactions, because of their weak acidity in [Fe]ZSM5 or their rapid deactivation during the early stages of reaction (
Table 2
). In contrast, such chain growth and cyclization reactions are very fast during C3H8 reactions on H-[Al]ZSM5 and cation-exchanged H-[Al]ZSM5 
[34]
, 
[35]
.

C3H8 dehydrogenation rates were measured after H2 treatment for 3 h on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 793 K and 18.6 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity for 160 h in a packed-bed flow reactor (
Fig. 2
). C3H6 selectivities increased sharply during initial contact with reactants (∼100 ks) and then gradually at longer times (98.3 to 99.8%), until other products became nearly undetectable (
Fig. 2
); these findings appear to reflect the selective deactivation of acid sites responsible for cracking reactions. Concurrently, net dehydrogenation rates decreased from 5.9 to 2.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) over ∼160 h, corresponding to a decrease in forward reaction rate from 16.7 to 3.0 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) (
Fig. 2
). Shorter H2 treatments (1 h) before reaction led to incomplete reduction of Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and to a gradual initial increase in dehydrogenation rates as reduction continued during initial contact with C3H8 reactants.

Eq. (3)
 from the net rates on the 0.35 wt%. Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 at 30 kPa C3H8, 3.5 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s), and 792 K reported in 
[7]
.

Deactivation rates were much lower on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 793 K than on 0.35 wt% Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3, on which net C3H6 formation rate decreased by a factor of about 2 in ∼10 h at 792 K 
[7]
. In order to measure deactivation rate constants rigorously, forward reaction rates were estimated on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 using the data reported here and on 0.35 wt% Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 using reported net rates 
[7]
 and 
Eq. (3)
. Deactivation rate constants decreased rapidly during the early stages of reaction on both catalysts (
Fig. 2
), apparently because alkene and acid site concentrations decreased as deactivation occurred. First-order deactivation constants then reached constant values (
Fig. 2
) of 0.008 h−1 on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (80–600 ks) and 0.11 h−1 on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 (6–18 ks). These rate constants correspond to mean lives (τ; defined as the time required for the rate to reach e−1 of its initial value) of ∼125 h on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 and ∼9 h on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3. The isomorphic substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ in ZSM5 leads to weaker acidity 
[36]
, while the presence of small Pt clusters within protected 10-ring channels leads, in turn, to low hydrogenolysis turnover rates and to constrained environments that preclude transition states required to form large organic structures. These combined effects led to lower rates of oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization and to an apparent decrease in the rate of formation of unreactive organic residues responsible for deactivation on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM5 catalysts.

After C3H8 reactions for 160 h, Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 was treated in a flowing 40% H2 in He (
) mixture at 773 K for 2 h. This treatment did not recover or even influence dehydrogenation rates, indicating that organic residues responsible for deactivation do not react with H2 at reaction temperatures. Treatment in 1% O2/He (
) at 723 K for 2 h and re-reduction of the catalyst in a flowing 40% H2 in He (
) mixture at 773 K for 2 h, however, led to initial forward C3H8 dehydrogenation rates (16.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)), very similar to those on fresh catalysts (16.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s)). Deactivation rate constants (0.009 h−1) and C3H6 selectivities (99.6% after 50 h) were nearly identical to those on fresh catalysts (0.008 h−1, 99.4%). We conclude that oxidative treatments remove organic residues without any sintering or migration of Pt clusters. The deposition of organic residues is responsible for the slow deactivation observed during C3H8 dehydrogenation on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5; such residues can be fully removed, however, using mild oxidative treatments.

3.2. Comparison of Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 with previously reported alkane dehydrogenation catalysts
Pt and Pt–Sn species on nonacidic supports, such as MgAl2O4, lead to lower cracking and oligomerization rates and to slower deactivation than similar active structures supported on γ-Al2O3 or SiO2 
[11]
, 
[37]
. C3H8 dehydrogenation on 0.5 wt% Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 at 823 K, 39 kPa, and a space velocity of 9 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) led to 93–97% C3H6 selectivity and 11–12% C3H8 conversion 
[11]
. Deactivation rate constants obtained from forward reaction rates (0.05 h−1) were lower than on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3(0.11 h−1) 
[7]
, but much greater than reported here on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (0.008 h−1). Pt–Ga/MgAl2O4 shows greater rates, selectivity, and stability than Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 
[38]
. C3H8 reactions on 0.6 wt% Pt–Ga/MgAl2O4 at 878 K, 78 kPa, and 0.80 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity led to ∼30% conversion and 97–98% C3H6 selectivity, but deactivation rate constants (∼0.05 h−1) were also much higher than on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5.

Pt clusters on silicalite (pure silica ZSM5) also catalyze alkane dehydrogenation with high selectivity 
[39]
, but reaction rates are much lower than on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, apparently because the absence of exchange sites in silicalite leads to low dispersion of Pt precursors and crystallites. Deactivation rates are much lower than on Pt/Al2O3 and the addition of Zn increases rates, selectivity, and stability 
[40]
. C3H8 reactions on 0.5 wt% Pt/Zn/silicalite at 828 K and 0.7 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity led to 25–27% C3H8 conversion with 99% C3H6 selectivity; deactivation rate constants (∼0.01 h−1) are slightly higher than reported here on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, which gives higher C3H6 yields (35%) at higher space velocities (4.1 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) and lower temperatures (793 K) than these state-of-the-art Pt-based silicalite materials.

3.3. Effects of H2 removal by staged O2 introduction in a gradientless batch reactor
Thermodynamic constraints imposed by increasing H2 concentrations as alkane conversion increases prevent the use of these active and stable catalysts at even lower temperatures or higher conversions. In principle, these constraints can be removed by reactions that consume H2 as it forms. In practice, this requires that coreactants interact selectively with H2, without significant depletion of hydrocarbon reactants or products. For example, H2 combustion with O2 effectively removes H2, but the combustion of the predominant alkanes and alkenes must be much slower than the desired combustion of H2. H2 combustion selectivity should be favored when O2 is not available before H2 is formed or after H2 is depleted. The concurrent introduction of O2 and alkanes in the reactant stream can lead to significant hydrocarbon combustion before H2 becomes available from dehydrogenation reactions. Here, we explore the kinetic and thermodynamic consequences of staging the introduction of O2 coreactants as alkane conversion proceeds and H2 becomes available for reaction with O2.

Previous studies of O2 staging during C3H8 dehydrocyclodimerization reactions on cation-exchanged H-[Al]ZSM5 
[41]
 led to significant increases in aromatic yields over those achieved with pure C3H8 reactants. Staging intensities above stoichiometric values led to lower O2 reactant efficiencies without significant additional improvements in aromatic yields beyond those obtained at staging intensities near unity 
[41]
. Therefore, O2 introduction rates corresponding to overall staging intensities near unity were chosen initially for C3H8 and C2H6 reactions on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5. O2 introduction rates that vary with time, so as to more closely match the higher initial H2 formation rates and their ultimate decrease as conversion increases, ultimately led to more precise matching of O2 introduction and H2 formation rates and they were used in all experiments reported here. For C3H8 dehydrogenation, O2 introduction protocols that maintain an overall staging intensity of unity were implemented by initially using pure C3H8 for 0.3 ks in the batch recirculating reactors; O2 was then added at 0.23 mol/(g-atom Pt s) between 0.3 and 2.4 ks and finally at 0.14 mol/(g-atom Pt s) from 2.4 to 6.6 ks (
Table 1a
).

Fig. 3
 shows site yields for C3H6, C1–C2, and carbon oxide (COx) product yields during C3H8 dehydrogenation at 723 K and 20 kPa C3H8 in a gradientless batch reactor. Equilibrium C3H6 yields were quickly reached and C3H6 (
Fig. 3a
) and H2 (
Fig. 4a
) site yields reached constant values (∼103 mol/g-atom Pt) after 2.4 ks. C3H6 formation rates decreased with increasing contact time (
Fig. 3a
), because H2 accumulates as conversion increases. H2 increases the rate of reverse reactions and can also inhibit forward dehydrogenation rates.

Higher C3H6 yields were achieved when O2 was introduced gradually during reaction (
Fig. 3a
). Maximum C3H6 site yields increased from ∼103 mol C3H6/g-atom Pt (18% yield) to ∼1.7×103 mol C3H6/g-atom Pt (29% yield) when O2 was introduced at overall staging efficiencies of unity on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5. C3H6 formation rates decreased with increasing contact time during staging experiments (
Fig. 3a
), as H2 was nearly depleted via reactions with O2 (
Fig. 4a
). This reflects higher deactivation rates as H2 concentrations decrease and catalysts are exposed to higher concentrations of CO and alkenes without the concurrent presence of H2. Such conditions favor larger and less reactive unsaturated products and the formation of adsorbed carbon species via CO disproportionation reactions. These deactivation processes will be discussed in more detail in a later section. Cracking (C1–C2) rates were not influenced by the presence of O2 coreactants or by the removal of H2 (
Fig. 4b
), because cracking reactions remained far from equilibrium under all reaction conditions.

C2H4/C2H6 molar ratios were higher than equilibrium values at all contact times with pure C3H8 reactants and during O2 staging (
Table 3
), indicating that C2H4 is formed in primary cracking reactions of C3H8; C2H6 is formed via secondary hydrogenation of C2H4 and not via direct hydrogenolysis of C3H8 on Pt clusters. C2H4/C2H6 ratios decreased with increasing contact time for O2-free reactants, but increased during O2 staging, because C2H4 hydrogenation reactions depend on H2 concentrations. H2 concentrations decreased with contact time in staging experiments but increased during reactions of pure C3H8 reactants (
Table 3
). For both pure C3H8 reactants and staged O2 introduction experiments, the reaction equilibrium parameter η for C2H4 hydrogenation approached unity with increasing contact time (
Table 3
).

The percentage of the converted O2 used for H2 combustion reflects the relative reactivity and availability of H2, alkanes, and alkenes for reactions with O2. 
Fig. 4b
 shows added and residual amounts of O2 during C3H8 reactions on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 at 723 K. Residual O2 concentrations are very low (<0.1 μmol/cm3) throughout the entire conversion and contact time range. 
Fig. 5
 shows that 89–93% of the added O2 is used to combust H2, indicating that H2 removal by O2 is very selective when O2 coreactants are staged in a manner that ensures that H2 is available as O2 coreactants enter the reacting mixture. These H2 combustion selectivities are remarkable in view of the predominant presence of hydrocarbons in the prevalent reacting mixtures.

H2 combustion selectivities (% O-base) in cofeed and staged modes during C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions in a gradientless batch reactor [723 K, 20 kPa C3H8, cofeed: 4 kPa O2 or O2 staging protocol: (1) 0–0.3 ks without O2, (2) 0.3–2.4 ks 0.23 mol/(g-atom Pt s), (3) 2.4–6.6 ks 0.14 mol/(g-atom Pt s), balance He, 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5].

In order to determine the extent to which homogeneous reactions contribute to combustion pathways, the reaction products and unreacted C3H8 remaining after C3H8 reactions on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (17% conversion; 3.6 ks, 723 K) were isolated, mixed with 1 kPa O2, and reacted in an empty reactor at 723 K (0.7 cm3 heated volume). COx formation and H2 combustion rates were compared at similar H2 and O2 concentrations with those measured during catalytic dehydrogenation reactions using the O2 introduction protocol described in 
Table 1a
. Catalytic COx formation and H2 combustion rates were much higher than homogeneous rates (
Table 4
), indicating that observed alkene and H2 combustion rates during staged and cofeed O2 experiments reflect surface-catalyzed reactions. Homogeneous first-order combustion rate constants were about 15 times greater for C3H6 than for C3H8; taken together with the low initial COx selectivity in catalytic staged experiments and its increase with contact time, these data suggest that COx formed during staging catalytic experiments arise predominately from combustion reactions of alkenes formed in dehydrogenation reactions.

O2 staging experiments were also carried out at lower initial C3H8 pressures (5 kPa) and overall O2 staging intensities of unity (
Table 5
). The O2 staging protocol is shown in 
Table 1b
. Higher maximum C3H6 yields were achieved with O2 staging at 5 kPa (40.5%) than at 20 kPa (28.8%), but the ratios of these C3H6 yields to the corresponding equilibrium yields were lower at 5 kPa C3H8 (1.26) than at 20 kPa (1.58). 
Fig. 6
 shows that H2 combustion selectivities were very similar for these two reactant pressures (e.g., 89% at 20 kPa and 87% at 5 kPa and 30% conversion).

Table 1
 [20 kPa C2H6 and 5, 20 kPa C3H8, 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, gradientless batch reactor].

C2H6 dehydrogenation (20 kPa) was also studied at 773 K on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 using the O2 staging protocol shown in 
Table 1c
. A higher temperature was chosen than that for C3H8 reactants because alkane reactivities and equilibrium alkene yields decrease with decreasing alkane chain size. C2H6 dehydrogenation data are shown in 
Fig. 7
 and 
Table 5
. Equilibrium C2H4 yields were quickly reached (∼2 ks) with O2-free reactants at 773 K. O2 staging led to significantly higher yields (1.1×103 mol C2H4/g-atom Pt, 19% C2H4 yield) than with O2-free reactants (0.68×103 mol C2H4/g-atom Pt, 12% C2H4 yield) (
Fig. 7a
). The ratio of the experimental to equilibrium C2H4 yields with O2 staging was 1.58 (
Table 5
). H2 combustion selectivities at similar alkane conversion levels were lower for C2H6 at 773 K than for C3H8 at 723 K (
Fig. 6
). This is not unexpected because H2 combustion typically shows lower activation energies than hydrocarbon combustion reactions in homogeneous 
[42]
 and catalytic 
[43]
 systems. Thus, the higher reaction temperatures used in C2H6 dehydrogenation reactions favor combustion of the predominant hydrocarbon species over competing reactions of less abundant H2 molecules.

3.4. Comparison of O2 staging with cofeed strategies
C3H8 dehydrogenation rates and selectivities during staged O2 introduction were compared with those measured when equivalent amounts of O2 were introduced concurrently with C3H8 reactants. O2 was introduced with C3H8 (20 kPa) either initially (4 kPa) or continuously (
Table 1a
; staging intensity of unity). In cofeed experiments, residual O2 concentrations were initially very high, but O2 was consumed rapidly in hydrocarbon combustion reactions to form COx and H2O (
Fig. 4b
). O2 became undetectable after ∼0.6 ks contact times, at which point C3H6 yields were still low (2.5%) and far from equilibrium; in cofeed experiments, O2 was only available, and rapidly consumed in unselective hydrocarbon combustion reactions, when C3H8 conversions were low and H2 was not yet available. As a result, O2 was consumed unselectively and it became unavailable to remove H2 as dehydrogenation reactions approached equilibrium. 
Fig. 3a
 also shows that C3H6 formation rates were much lower during cofeed experiments than in staged O2 or O2-free operating modes; this reflects deactivation events favored at the high CO concentrations and low H2 concentrations prevalent during the early stages of C3H8 dehydrogenation with O2 cofeed, as discussed below.

Fig. 3c
 shows COx site yields for stoichiometric staging and cofeed experiments. In cofeed mode, COx site yields initially increased rapidly with increasing contact time until O2 was depleted and COx could no longer form. COx formation rates and site yields were much higher with C3H8–O2 reactants than at the lower O2 concentrations prevalent during staged O2 introduction. H2 combustion selectivities were much lower (5–8%) in cofeed experiments than during stoichiometric O2 staging (90%) as shown in 
Fig. 5
. The low H2 combustion selectivities in cofeed experiments reflect the substantial absence of H2 at short contact times, during which O2 is abundant, and the depletion of O2 via unselective reactions before dehydrogenation approaches equilibrium at longer contact times (
Fig. 4b
).

3.5. Catalyst deactivation during C3H8 dehydrogenation with O2 introduction
When H2 is removed selectively via reactions with O2, alkene yields are no longer constrained by thermodynamics; as a result, they should increase monotonically with contact time. Near-stoichiometric O2 introduction rates, however, led to asymptotic alkene yields as contact time increased (
Fig. 3a
, 
Fig. 7a
). These data do not reflect any effects of reverse reactions, because H2 was continuously removed as contact time increased via reactions with O2 and its concentration remained very low. It is possible that H2O or CO, formed in combustion reactions, inhibit or poison active sites, or that low H2 concentrations prevalent during staging experiments favor unsaturated carbonaceous residues that block access to active sites. These possibilities were examined by comparing measured time yields with those predicted from thermodynamically consistent kinetic models of C3H6 dehydrogenation reactions.

On Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, C3H8 reactions include primary dehydrogenation to form C3H6, primary cracking reactions to form CH4 and C2H4 (
Scheme 1
), and secondary hydrogenation of C2H4 to form C2H6. Initial COx carbon selectivities (extrapolated to zero reactant conversion) are very low (<0.1%), suggesting that COx forms predominately via combustion of C3H6 and not directly from C3H8. Rate constants for each nonoxidative step were estimated from reaction rates and selectivities for pure C3H8 reactants. 
Fig. 8a
 shows experimental and predicted concentrations of C3H6 and C1–C2 products as a function of contact time. These parameters were then used to describe the results obtained during O2 staging, for which COx formation rate constants (k3) were estimated from COx formation rates. Data and model predictions are shown in 
Fig. 8b
 for 20 kPa C3H8 and the staging protocol in 
Table 1a
. C3H6 yields during O2 staging were accurately described at short contact times (<2 ks), but the kinetic model predicted higher C3H6 yields than experimentally observed as contact time and C3H8 conversion increased. Measured C3H6 yields reached limiting values as conversion increases, while the model, which rigorously accounts for all thermodynamic effects, predicts a monotonic increase in C3H6 yields. This apparent decrease in forward C3H8 dehydrogenation rates with increasing contact time reflects a loss of catalytic sites, which does not occur with pure C3H8 reactants in batch reactors (
Fig. 8a
) or in long-term flow experiments (
Fig. 2
). Therefore, O2, its reaction products H2O and CO, or the concomitant high alkene/H2 ratios prevalent for reactions of C3H8–O2 mixtures led to deactivation or to kinetic inhibition of active sites during C3H8 dehydrogenation on Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5.

The extent of this deactivation or kinetic inhibition was described using a site accessibility factor (Φ), defined as the ratio of the experimental forward rate to that predicted by the kinetic model at each contact time. Values of Φ are shown in 
Fig. 9
 for C3H8 reactions at 723 K and an O2 staging efficiency of unity; they decrease from their initial value of unity to ∼0.20 at 6.6 ks during experiments, but remain near unity at all contact times for pure C3H8 reactants.

Site accessibility factors for forward C3H6 formation rate on 0.1 wt% Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 [flow reactor: 723 K, 18.6 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s), 20 kPa C3H8, balance He; batch reactor: 723 K, 20 kPa C3H8, O2 staging protocol: (1) 0–0.3 ks without O2, (2) 0.3–2.4 ks 0.23 mol/(g-atom Pt s), (3) 2.4–6.6 ks 0.14 mol/(g-atom Pt s), balance He; catalyst regeneration: 723 K, dry air, 2 h].

Rate measurements in a flow reactor (723 K; 18.6 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity) before and after semi-batch O2 staging experiments gave similar values of Φ (
Fig. 9
). These similar values indicate that loss of activity was not caused by kinetic inhibition of C3H8 dehydrogenation rates by H2O or COx combustion products, but by irreversible titration of active sites. Treatment in dry air at 723 K for 2 h restored initial C3H8 dehydrogenation rates, suggesting that site blockage was caused by carbon deposition via CO disproportionation or alkene oligomerization and aromatization reactions. These reactions are favored as catalysts are exposed to high alkene and CO concentrations without the concurrent presence of H2. The recovery of catalytic rates by oxidative treatments indicates that neither Pt sintering nor loss of zeolite crystallinity are responsible for the observed deactivation.

The effect of CO on deactivation rates was also probed by adding CO (0.025 kPa) to C3H8 reactants (20 kPa; 18.6 mol C3H8/(g-atom Pt s) space velocity) in a flow reactor at 793 K. Deactivation rate constants increased from 0.008 h−1 with pure C3H8 reactants to 0.06 h−1 when CO was added, suggesting that CO disproportionation reactions are involved in deactivation processes observed during cofeed experiments and, to a lesser extent, during O2 staging. These experiments, however, overestimate the effects of CO in staged O2 experiments because the catalyst bed is exposed to the entering reactant stream before any H2 can be formed in dehydrogenation reactions. Also, staged O2 addition led to higher C6+ selectivity (0.19% vs 0.075%; at ∼17% C3H8 conversion), suggesting that lower H2 concentrations prevalent during O2 staging favored oligomerization and aromatization reactions, which can also lead to unreactive unsaturated deposits.

Thus, precise control of O2 introduction rates and local H2 concentrations is required in order to overcome thermodynamic barriers in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, because of the need to avoid site blocking favored by high alkene/H2 ratios and CO concentrations prevalent during O2 staging. Optimum performance typically requires overall O2 staging intensities slightly below stoichiometric values and O2 introduction rates that vary with reactor position in tubular flow reactors or with contact time in semibatch reactors.

3.6. Comparison of O2 staging with catalytic H2 combustion
A previous study reported C3H8 dehydrogenation reactions coupled with H2 combustion in a three-stage process designed to increase C3H6 yields above equilibrium values 
[25]
. In this scheme, the first and third stages contained 0.7 wt% Pt–Sn[AL]ZSM5 (2 g) and the intermediate stage contained 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 (0.1 g), which provided lattice oxygen atoms for selective combustion of H2 formed in the first stage. Air was introduced into the middle stage in order to replenish lattice oxygen atoms as they reacted with H2 to form H2O. C3H8 rates and selectivities were compared with those achieved when the middle stage was bypassed (
Table 5
). The three-stage process gave 30% C3H6 yields with 99% C3H6 selectivity for an O2/C3H8 ratio of 0.06. Higher O2/C3H8 ratios (0.12) gave slightly higher C3H6 yields (33%), but lower selectivities (96%). These two O2/C3H8 ratios gave C3H6 yields about 1.2–1.3 greater than the equilibrium values attainable without H2 removal. These yield enhancements (1.2–1.3) are lower than those reported here at significantly lower temperatures using staged O2 introduction (1.58) and a single-stage Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst. Both this three-stage cyclic process 
[25]
 and our single-stage system gave low COx selectivities (<5%) and high O2 reactant efficiencies. Staging strategies, however, avoid the cyclic operation required in multistage systems, while using a single catalysts for selective combustion of H2 and dehydrogenation of alkanes; these features markedly decrease process complexity and costs. Staged O2 introduction can be implemented using multiple injectors in large-scale packed-bed or fluid-bed reactors. It can also be achieved using ceramic membranes as reactor walls, which can additionally separate pure O2 from ambient air.

4. Conclusions
High C3H8 dehydrogenation rates with high alkene selectivities and yields and unprecedented catalyst stability were achieved using Pt clusters residing within shape-selective channels in Na-[Fe]ZSM5. These materials provide anchoring sites for Pt exchange, which lead to well-dispersed clusters during subsequent reduction, and much weaker acid sites than [Al]ZSM5 materials. Deactivation rate constants (∼0.008 h−1) were much lower than on previously reported dehydrogenation catalysts and initial reaction rates and selectivity were recovered using mild oxidative treatments after 160 h on stream. Staged O2 introduction led to the combustion of H2 with ∼90% selectivity on these catalysts, even when hydrocarbons were predominant components in reacting mixtures. Alkene yields higher than equilibrium by a factor of ∼1.6 were achieved for C2H6 and C3H8 dehydrogenation at 773 and 723 K, respectively. These enhancement factors are significantly higher than previously reported with a more complex three-stage selective H2 combustion scheme. Cofeeding alkane–O2 reactant mixtures led to the rapid combustion of hydrocarbons and to the depletion of O2 before H2 is formed and dehydrogenation reactions approach equilibrium. High O2 concentrations lead to CO formation and to H2 depletion, both of which favor the formation of deactivating deposits. Thus, precise control of O2 introduction location and rate is required in order to ensure that O2 reactants become available as H2 is formed in dehydrogenation reactions.
