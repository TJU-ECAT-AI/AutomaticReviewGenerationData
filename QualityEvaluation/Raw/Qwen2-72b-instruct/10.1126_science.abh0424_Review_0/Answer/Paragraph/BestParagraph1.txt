The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is introduced as a powerful approach to address the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes \[10.1038/nchem.1018\]. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, providing precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The nanoscale tandem catalyst particle translates macroscale engineering strategies into a single particle for propane to propylene conversion, overcoming limitations of physical or temporal separation of dehydrogenation and combustion \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The nanoscale overcoating geometry of tandem catalysis offers opportunities for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is an example of how tandem catalysis can be used to optimize processes by coupling endothermic and exothermic reactions to improve overall energy efficiency \[10.1016/j.joule.2018.10.027\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, open up new avenues for the design of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts for multiple-step chemical reactions. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced catalysts that integrate multiple reaction steps, such as the selective production of propanal from methanol and ethylene \[10.1038/nchem.1018\]. The use of bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support can lead to more efficient use of reactants and energy, as well as better control over product selectivity and yield \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, can be seen as a form of tandem catalysis, where the two metals work together to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The use of such catalysts can lead to higher energy efficiency and process optimization by reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts and increasing the yield of the desired olefins \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The literature highlights the importance of careful catalyst design to minimize side reactions and maximize the desired product yield, which is a key goal of tandem catalysis \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale can potentially fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market by facilitating the on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane \[10.1126/science.abh0424\].
