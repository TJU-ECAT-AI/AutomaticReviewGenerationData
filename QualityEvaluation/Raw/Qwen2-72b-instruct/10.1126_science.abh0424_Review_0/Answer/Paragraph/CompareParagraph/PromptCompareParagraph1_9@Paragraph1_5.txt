Tandem catalysis at nanoscale
Chemical engineering processes are typically governed by multiple unit operations. To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations. A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries (1). On page 1257 of this issue, Yan et al. (2) present a tandem catalyst with porous overcoating structures, In2O3-Pt/Al2O3, for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.
To control the reaction sequence and selectivity under the coexistence of reactants, intermediates, and products, the design of tandem catalysts plays a crucial role in mediating the multiple reactions under the same condition (3). In principle, a tandem catalyst is composed of different types of catalytic sites, and a predetermined sequence of reactions occurs at each corresponding catalytic site. The key to manipulating the process of tandem catalysis is to coordinate the transport of reactive intermediates among catalytic sites (4, 5). Random physical mixtures of catalysts cannot effectively mediate the reaction sequence. Therefore, the proximity (6, 7) and hierarchy (8) of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst must be carefully constructed to regulate the transport of key intermediates.
Tandem catalysis with porous overcoating structurePropane dehydrogenation makes propylene, which is an important feedstock for polymers. The porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes the selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The relative location of the alumina-supported platinum and the indium oxide ceramic is important for tandem catalysis.GRAPHIC: V. ALTOUNIAN/SCIENCE BASED ON C. PEI AND J. GONG
The research on the tandem coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation to selective H2 combustion bridges the fundamental philosophy to the industrial application. The on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane is a highly desired process to fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market (9, 10). The catalytic propane dehydrogenation process as an endothermic reaction is restricted by the thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as sintering and coking under high temperatures (11, 12). Instant removal of H2 through selective combustion could force the catalytic dehydrogenation to move forward and break the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction (13). However, to avoid the combustion of carbon species, the catalytic dehydrogenation and selective H2 combustion must be properly regulated in sequence by the tandem catalyst.

The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is pivotal in addressing the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes, as it provides precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, translating macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for propane to propylene conversion \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. This tandem catalyst design overcomes the limitations of physical or temporal separation of dehydrogenation and combustion, leading to rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The nanoscale overcoating geometry of tandem catalysis offers opportunities for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst allows for the coupling of two reaction steps in a single catalytic system, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing the need for intermediate separation steps and reducing the overall reaction temperature \[10.1126/science.abh0424\]. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts, such as the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, can lead to higher selectivity and stability, reducing the need for regeneration and thus saving energy \[10.1021/cr5002436\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, open up new avenues for the design of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts. Future research might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of tandem catalytic processes, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation and H2 combustion. The exploration of innovative bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts with optimized hierarchical structures could lead to breakthroughs in energy efficiency and process optimization. Additionally, the integration of advanced computational methods for catalyst design and the development of in situ characterization techniques to monitor catalytic processes at the nanoscale could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of tandem catalysis, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts. The potential for these catalysts to address the supply-demand gap in the alkene market and contribute to more sustainable and economically viable processes for olefin production underscores the importance of continued research in this field.
