                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in tandem catalysis, particularly the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, open up new avenues for the design of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts. Future research might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can further optimize the process by improving selectivity and stability, reducing the need for regeneration, and saving energy. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, in tandem catalysis could be explored to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity. Additionally, the use of advanced materials and fabrication techniques could lead to the creation of more efficient tandem catalysts with improved control over the proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites, thus regulating the transport of intermediates more effectively. The potential for integrating tandem catalysis with other process engineering concepts, such as reactor cascades, membrane reactors, and chemical looping, could also be investigated to address the limitations of current processes. The ultimate goal is to achieve higher energy efficiency and better process optimization, potentially filling the supply-demand gap in the alkene market.
