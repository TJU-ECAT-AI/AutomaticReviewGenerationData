                    The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is introduced as a powerful approach to address the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes, enabling sequential reactions under a single condition to minimize energy consumption and economic cost \[10.1126/science.abh0424\]. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, translating macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle for propane to propylene conversion \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites within the tandem catalyst are crucial for regulating the transport of intermediates, facilitating the on-purpose production of propylene and breaking the thermodynamic limitation of nonoxidative catalytic reactions by instantly removing H2 through selective combustion \[10.1126/science.abh0424\]. The porous overcoating structure of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species, promoting selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward \[10.1126/science.abh0424\]. This tandem catalysis offers opportunities for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering \[10.1126/science.abd4441\]. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale involves the use of bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support, leading to more efficient use of reactants and energy, as well as better control over product selectivity and yield \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst combines the dehydrogenation activity of In2O3 with the hydrogen combustion activity of Pt, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization by coupling two reaction steps on a single catalyst \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, can be seen as a form of tandem catalysis, where the two metals work together to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The use of bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support can simplify the overall process, potentially leading to higher energy efficiency and better process optimization \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in tandem catalysis at the nanoscale, as exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, open up new avenues for the design of high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts. The precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates achieved through tandem catalysis can lead to the development of catalysts that are capable of performing multiple reaction steps in a single catalytic system, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization. Future research efforts might focus on the exploration of novel bimetallic catalysts and the combination of different catalytic functionalities on a single support, aiming to further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of tandem catalytic systems. The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, presents an opportunity to optimize the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, improving selectivity and stability of the catalyst, and potentially increasing the yield of desired products while reducing the need for catalyst regeneration. The literature highlights the importance of careful catalyst design to minimize side reactions and maximize the desired product yield, which is a key goal of tandem catalysis. The development of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which can potentially improve energy efficiency and process optimization by integrating multiple reaction steps, represents a promising direction for future research. The integrated approach of coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, as demonstrated by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, could lead to a more sustainable and economically viable process for olefin production, potentially filling the supply-demand gap in the alkene market.
