          The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the development of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which can potentially improve energy efficiency and process optimization by integrating multiple reaction steps. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is mentioned for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, which could represent a form of tandem catalysis. This approach could lead to more efficient use of resources and energy by simultaneously converting propane to propylene and utilizing the generated hydrogen in a separate reaction, thus potentially enhancing overall process efficiency. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is also mentioned in the context of coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, which could enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by utilizing the heat generated from H2 combustion to drive the endothermic propane dehydrogenation reaction. This integrated approach could lead to a more sustainable and economically viable process for olefin production.
