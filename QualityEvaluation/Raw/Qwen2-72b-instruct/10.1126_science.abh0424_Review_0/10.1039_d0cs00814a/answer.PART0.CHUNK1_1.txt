1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the development of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which can potentially improve energy efficiency and process optimization by integrating multiple reaction steps. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is mentioned for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, which could represent a form of tandem catalysis. This approach could lead to more efficient use of resources and energy by simultaneously converting propane to propylene and utilizing the generated hydrogen in a separate reaction, thus potentially enhancing overall process efficiency.

1.纳米尺度上的串联催化概念在提供的文献中没有直接提及。但是，文献确实讨论了丙烷脱氢的先进催化剂的开发，这可能通过整合多个反应步骤来提高能源效率和过程优化。例如，文献中提到了In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，这可能代表了一种串联催化的形式。这种方法可以通过同时将丙烷转化为丙烯并利用生成的氢气进行单独反应，从而更有效地利用资源和能源，因此可能提高整体过程效率。
