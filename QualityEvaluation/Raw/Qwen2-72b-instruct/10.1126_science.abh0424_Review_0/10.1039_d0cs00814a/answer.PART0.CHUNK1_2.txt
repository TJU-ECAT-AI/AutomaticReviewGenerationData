1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the development of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which could potentially be integrated into tandem catalytic processes for improved energy efficiency and process optimization. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is not specifically mentioned, but the literature does highlight the importance of designing catalysts with optimal active sites, dehydrogenation pathways, and deactivation mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
