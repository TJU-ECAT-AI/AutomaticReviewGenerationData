1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the development of advanced catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which could potentially be applied in tandem catalysis processes to improve energy efficiency and process optimization. For instance, the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst mentioned could couple catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, potentially leading to higher overall efficiency by utilizing the heat generated from H2 combustion to drive the endothermic propane dehydrogenation reaction.
