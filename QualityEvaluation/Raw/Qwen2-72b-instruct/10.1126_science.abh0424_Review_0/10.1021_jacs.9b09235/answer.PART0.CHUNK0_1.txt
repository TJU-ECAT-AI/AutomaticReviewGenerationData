1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not addressed in the provided literature. The literature focuses on the development of dual-functional MoVO mixed oxides for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization, as well as the specific example of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, are not discussed.
