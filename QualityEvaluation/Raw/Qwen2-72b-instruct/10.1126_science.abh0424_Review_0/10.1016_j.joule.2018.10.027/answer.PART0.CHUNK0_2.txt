1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, tandem catalysis involves the integration of multiple catalytic sites or materials to perform sequential reactions in a single reactor, which can enhance energy efficiency and process optimization by minimizing intermediate product separation steps and improving overall reaction selectivity and yield. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion is not discussed in the literature, but such a catalyst could potentially enable the direct conversion of propane to acrylic acid or other products by combining the dehydrogenation of propane with the combustion of the resulting hydrogen, thereby increasing energy efficiency and reducing byproduct formation.

1.在纳米尺度上的串联催化概念在提供的文献中没有直接涉及。然而，串联催化涉及在单个反应器中整合多个催化位点或材料以执行连续反应，这可以通过最小化中间产物分离步骤和提高总体反应选择性和产量来增强能源效率和过程优化。文献中没有讨论In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于耦合催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧，但这种催化剂可能能够通过结合丙烷的脱氢与产生的氢的燃烧，直接将丙烷转化为丙烯酸或其他产品，从而提高能源效率并减少副产物的形成。
