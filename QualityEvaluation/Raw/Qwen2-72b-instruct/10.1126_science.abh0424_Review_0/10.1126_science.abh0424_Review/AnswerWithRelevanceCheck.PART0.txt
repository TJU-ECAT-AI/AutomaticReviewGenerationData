          The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under a single condition, which can minimize energy consumption and economic cost. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, where the proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites are crucial for regulating the transport of intermediates. This tandem catalysis not only facilitates the on-purpose production of propylene but also breaks the thermodynamic limitation of nonoxidative catalytic reactions by instantly removing H2 through selective combustion. The porous overcoating structure of the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst regulates the transport of hydrogen species, promoting selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. This tandem catalysis has implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the chemical industry, potentially filling the supply-demand gap in the alkene market.
