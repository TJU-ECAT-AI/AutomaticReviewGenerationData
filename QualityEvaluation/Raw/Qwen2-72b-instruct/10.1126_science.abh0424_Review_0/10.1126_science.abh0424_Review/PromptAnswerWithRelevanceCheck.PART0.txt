[1] "Tandem catalysis at nanoscale Chemical engineering processes are typically governed by multiple unit operations. To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations."
[2] "A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries."
[3] "On page 1257 of this issue, Yan et al. (2) present a tandem catalyst with porous overcoating structures, In2O3-Pt/Al2O3, for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion."
[4] "The porous overcoating structure regulates the transport of hydrogen species and promotes the selective H2 combustion, which consequently drives catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward."
[5] "The on-purpose production of propylene directly from propane is a highly desired process to fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market."
[6] "Instant removal of H2 through selective combustion could force the catalytic dehydrogenation to move forward and break the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction."

1.Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under a single condition, which can minimize energy consumption and economic cost. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, where the porous overcoating structure regulates hydrogen transport and promotes selective H2 combustion, driving the dehydrogenation forward. This tandem catalysis has potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the production of propylene, a key alkene market product, by breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions.
