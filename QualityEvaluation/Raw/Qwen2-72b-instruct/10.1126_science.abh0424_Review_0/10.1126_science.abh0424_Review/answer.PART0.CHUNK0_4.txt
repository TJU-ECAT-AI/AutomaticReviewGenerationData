1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under a single condition, which can lead to more efficient and cost-effective processes. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, potentially breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions and driving the reaction forward by instantly removing H2 through selective combustion. This tandem catalysis has implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the chemical industry.
