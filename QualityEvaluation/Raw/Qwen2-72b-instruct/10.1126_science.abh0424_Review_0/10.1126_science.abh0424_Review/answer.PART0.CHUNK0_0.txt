1.Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under a single condition, which can minimize energy consumption and economic cost. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, where the porous overcoating structure regulates hydrogen transport and promotes selective H2 combustion, driving the dehydrogenation forward. This tandem catalysis has potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization in the production of propylene, a key alkene market product, by breaking the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative catalytic reactions.
