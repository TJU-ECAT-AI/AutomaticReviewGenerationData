1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under one condition, which can minimize energy consumption and economic cost. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies this by coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion, where the proximity and hierarchy of catalytic sites are crucial for regulating the transport of key intermediates. This tandem catalysis not only facilitates the on-purpose production of propylene but also breaks the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction by instantly removing H2 through selective combustion.

1.纳米尺度上的串联催化概念通过在单一条件下实现连续反应，解决了化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，这可以最小化能耗和经济成本。In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂通过将催化丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合，展示了这一点，其中催化位点的接近性和层次结构对于调节关键中间体的传输至关重要。这种串联催化不仅促进了目的性生产丙烯，还通过即时去除H2的选择性燃烧打破了非氧化催化反应的热力学限制。
