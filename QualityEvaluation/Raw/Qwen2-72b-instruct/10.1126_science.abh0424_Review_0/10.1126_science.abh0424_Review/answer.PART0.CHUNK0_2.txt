1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by enabling sequential reactions under a single condition, which can effectively minimize energy consumption and economic cost. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 tandem catalyst, with its porous overcoating structure, facilitates the coupling of catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. This design regulates the transport of hydrogen species, promoting selective H2 combustion, which in turn drives the catalytic propane dehydrogenation forward. The direct production of propylene from propane using this tandem catalyst has the potential to fill the supply-demand gap in the alkene market. By instantly removing H2 through selective combustion, the tandem catalyst breaks the thermodynamic limitation of the nonoxidative catalytic reaction, allowing for more efficient and optimized chemical processes.
