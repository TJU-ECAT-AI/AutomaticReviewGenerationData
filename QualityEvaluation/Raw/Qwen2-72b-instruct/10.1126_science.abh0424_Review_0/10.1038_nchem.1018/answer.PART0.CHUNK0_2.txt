1.The literature does not provide information on how the concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes, nor does it discuss the potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization. The literature focuses on the use of a nanocrystal bilayer structure formed by assembling platinum and cerium oxide nanocube monolayers on a silica substrate for tandem catalysis of sequential reactions, specifically the production of propanal from methanol and ethylene. The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is introduced as a powerful approach towards designing high-performance, multifunctional nanostructured catalysts for multiple-step chemical reactions.

1.文献没有提供关于纳米尺度上串联催化概念如何解决化学工程过程中整合多个反应步骤的挑战，以及对能源效率和过程优化的潜在影响的信息。文献主要关注在硅基底上组装铂和氧化铈纳米立方体单层形成的纳米晶体双层结构，用于串联催化连续反应，特别是从甲醇和乙烯生产丙醛。纳米尺度上的串联催化概念被引入为设计高性能、多功能纳米结构催化剂以进行多步化学反应的强大方法。
