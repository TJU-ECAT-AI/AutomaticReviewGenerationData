1.Tandem catalysis integrates multiple reactions, promising to enhance chemical processing by addressing the challenge of precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion at the nanoscale. By translating macroscale engineering strategies into a single nanoscale tandem catalyst particle, this design allows for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This approach overcomes limitations typically addressed through physical or temporal separation of dehydrogenation and combustion, such as in reactor cascades, membrane reactors, and chemical looping. The result is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with high per-pass yields that exceed the PDH equilibrium. This nanoscale overcoating geometry in tandem catalysis offers a validated opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions, potentially leading to significant improvements in energy efficiency and process optimization.

1.串联催化将多个反应集成在一起，承诺通过解决对反应中间体的精确时空控制的挑战来增强化学加工。这在In2O3-Pt/Al2O3催化剂中得到了体现，该催化剂在纳米尺度上将丙烷脱氢与选择性H2燃烧耦合。通过将宏规模工程策略转化为单一的纳米尺度串联催化剂粒子，这种设计允许选择性催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯。这种方法克服了通常通过脱氢和燃烧的物理或时间分离来解决的限制，例如在反应器级联、膜反应器和化学循环中。结果是丙烷的快速和稳定的氧化脱氢，具有超过PDH平衡的高每通道产量。这种纳米尺度涂层几何形状在串联催化中的应用为在重大挑战反应中实现高度选择性的催化性能提供了一个经过验证的机会，这可能导致能源效率和过程优化的显著改进。
