1.Tandem catalysis, by integrating multiple reactions, has the potential to enhance chemical processing efficiency. However, achieving precise control over reactive intermediates in space and time has been a challenge. The In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exemplifies the translation of macroscale engineering strategies into a nanoscale tandem catalyst for propane to propylene conversion. This development addresses the limitations of traditional process engineering concepts like reactor cascades, membrane reactors, and chemical looping, which can be difficult to implement. The tandem catalyst enables rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with high yields, exceeding the equilibrium limit of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. This nanoscale overcoating geometry in tandem catalysis offers a validated opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in complex reactions, potentially leading to significant improvements in energy efficiency and process optimization.
