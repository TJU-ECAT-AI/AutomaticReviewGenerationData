This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The nanoscale tandem catalyst particle translates macroscale engineering strategies into a single particle for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity and selectivity for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions.
