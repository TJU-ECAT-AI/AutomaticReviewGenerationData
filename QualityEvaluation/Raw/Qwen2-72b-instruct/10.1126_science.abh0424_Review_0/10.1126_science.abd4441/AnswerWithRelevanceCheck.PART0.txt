          Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by providing precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The nanoscale tandem catalyst particle translates macroscale engineering strategies into a single particle for propane to propylene conversion. This tandem catalyst design for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene overcomes the limitations of physical or temporal separation of dehydrogenation and combustion, leading to rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium. The nanoscale overcoating geometry of tandem catalysis offers opportunities for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization in chemical engineering.
