1.Tandem catalysis at the nanoscale addresses the challenges of integrating multiple reaction steps in chemical engineering processes by providing precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates. This is exemplified by the In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which couples catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion. The nanoscale tandem catalyst particle translates macroscale engineering strategies into a single particle for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This tandem catalyst design shows that overcoats can stabilize metal nanoparticles and tightly couple reactions on the nanoscale to balance activity and selectivity for biomimetic, direct transfer of reactive intermediates between two different catalyst functions. The potential implications for energy efficiency and process optimization include rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium, which validates tandem catalysis as an opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in grand challenge reactions.
