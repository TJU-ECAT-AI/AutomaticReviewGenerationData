1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does describe a single-stage catalytic system that integrates dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion using staged O2 introduction. This approach significantly simplifies the process compared to previously reported three-stage systems, potentially improving energy efficiency and process optimization.

1.The concept of tandem catalysis at the nanoscale is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the use of a single catalyst, Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, for both the dehydrogenation of alkanes and the selective combustion of hydrogen using staged O2 introduction. This approach simplifies the process by eliminating the need for multiple reactors and catalysts, which can improve energy efficiency and process optimization. The use of a single catalyst for multiple reaction steps is a form of tandem catalysis, where the proximity of active sites for different reactions can enhance overall process efficiency and selectivity.
