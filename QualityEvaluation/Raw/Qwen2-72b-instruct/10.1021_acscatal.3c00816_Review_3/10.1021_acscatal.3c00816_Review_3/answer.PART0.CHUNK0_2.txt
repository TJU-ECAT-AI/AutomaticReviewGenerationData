[1] "To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."
[2] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

1.Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy that combines precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, allowing complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170 C, or 2 minutes at 190 C. This ultrafast crystallization rate enables the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

1.于等人开发了一种超快速沸石结晶策略，该策略结合了前体年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，使ZSM-5沸石在170 C下5分钟内或190 C下2分钟内完全结晶。这种超快速结晶速率使PtSn簇能够完全封装在ZSM-5沸石中。优化的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂显示出65%的初始丙烷转化率，显著高于浸渍的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。
