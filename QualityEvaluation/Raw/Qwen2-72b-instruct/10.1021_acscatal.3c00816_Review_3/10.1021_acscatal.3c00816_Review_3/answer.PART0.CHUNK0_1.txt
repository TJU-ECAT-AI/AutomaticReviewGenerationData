[1] "To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."
[2] "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace."
[3] "In comparison, the Sn species were fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage. Ultravioletvisible light diffuse reflectance (UVvis DR) spectra reveal that the Sn species initially transform into amorphous SnO2, which subsequently transform into the Td Sn species within the zeolite framework and help improve the Pt dispersion."
[4] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm."
[5] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

1.Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, which significantly accelerates the crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy enables complete crystallization within 5 minutes at 170°C, and further reduces the time to 2 minutes at 190°C. The ultrafast crystallization rate facilitates the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolites. As the zeolite crystallinity increases, the Pt loadings in the silica matrix also increase, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. The Sn species are fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage, transforming into amorphous SnO2 and then into Td Sn species within the zeolite framework, which improves the dispersion of Pt. By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt% and increasing the Sn loading from 0 to 1.2 wt%, the size of the PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

1.于等人通过结合前体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，开发了一种超快速沸石结晶策略，这大大加速了ZSM-5沸石的结晶。该策略使170°C下5分钟内实现完全结晶，进一步将时间缩短至190°C下的2分钟。超快速结晶速率促进了PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石内的完全封装。随着沸石结晶度的增加，硅基质中的Pt负载量也增加，表明形成了Pt纳米簇。Sn物种在初始合成阶段完全嫁接到硅基质中，最初转化为无定形SnO2，随后转化为沸石框架内的Td Sn物种，有助于提高Pt的分散性。通过将Pt负载固定在0.32 wt%，并将Sn负载从0增加到1.2 wt%，PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm减小到1 nm。优化的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出65%的初始丙烷转化率，远高于浸渍的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。
