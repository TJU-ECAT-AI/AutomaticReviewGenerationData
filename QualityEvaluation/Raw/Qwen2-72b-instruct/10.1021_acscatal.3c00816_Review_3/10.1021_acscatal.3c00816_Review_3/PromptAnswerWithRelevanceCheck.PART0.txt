How does the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, and what are its effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion?

[1] "To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."
[2] "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace."
[3] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

1.Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, which significantly reduces the crystallization time of ZSM-5 zeolites to 5 minutes at 170 C and 2 minutes at 190 C. This strategy allows for the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the zeolites due to the ultrafast crystallization rate. The Pt loadings in the silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates an initial propane conversion of 65%, which is notably higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

1.于等人通过结合前体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，开发了一种超快速沸石结晶策略，这将ZSM-5沸石的结晶时间显著缩短至170 C时的5分钟和190 C时的2分钟。这一策略由于超快速的结晶速率，使得PtSn簇能够完全被封装在沸石中。随着沸石结晶度的增加，硅基质中的Pt负载量增加，这表明了Pt纳米簇的形成。优化的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出65%的初始丙烷转化率，这明显高于浸渍的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。

1.Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, which significantly accelerates the crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy enables complete crystallization within 5 minutes at 170°C, and further reduces the time to 2 minutes at 190°C. The ultrafast crystallization rate facilitates the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolites. As the zeolite crystallinity increases, the Pt loadings in the silica matrix also increase, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. The Sn species are fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage, transforming into amorphous SnO2 and then into Td Sn species within the zeolite framework, which improves the dispersion of Pt. By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt% and increasing the Sn loading from 0 to 1.2 wt%, the size of the PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.
