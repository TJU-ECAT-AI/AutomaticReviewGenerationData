          [1] "To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."
          [2] "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace."
          [3] "In comparison, the Sn species were fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage. Ultravioletvisible light diffuse reflectance (UVvis DR) spectra reveal that the Sn species initially transform into amorphous SnO2, which subsequently transform into the Td Sn species within the zeolite framework and help improve the Pt dispersion."
          [4] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm."
          [5] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

          Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, which allows complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170 C, or 2 minutes at 190 C. This ultrafast crystallization rate enables the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The Pt loadings in the silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. The Sn species transform into amorphous SnO2 initially and then into Td Sn species within the zeolite framework, which improves Pt dispersion. By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

          于等人通过结合前体年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，开发了一种超快速沸石结晶策略，使ZSM-5沸石在170 C下5分钟内或190 C下2分钟内完全结晶。这种超快速结晶速率使得PtSn簇能够完全封装在ZSM-5沸石中。随着沸石结晶度的增加，二氧化硅基质中的Pt负载量增加，表明形成了Pt纳米簇。相比之下，Sn物种在初始合成阶段完全嫁接到二氧化硅基质中。紫外可见光漫反射（UVvis DR）光谱显示，Sn物种最初转化为无定形SnO2，随后转化为沸石框架内的Td Sn物种，有助于提高Pt的分散性。当固定Pt负载量为0.32 wt %，并将Sn负载量从0增加到1.2 wt %时，PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm减小到1 nm。优化的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出65%的初始丙烷转化率，远高于浸渍的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。
