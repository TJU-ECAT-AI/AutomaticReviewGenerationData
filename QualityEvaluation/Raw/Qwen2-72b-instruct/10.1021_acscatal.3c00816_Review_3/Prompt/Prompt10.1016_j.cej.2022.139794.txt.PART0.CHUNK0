Potassium-promoted PtIn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 zeolite for efficient propane dehydrogenation Highlights • A stable PDH catalyst PtInK@S-1 is prepared by hydrothermal method for the first time. • PtInK@S-1 affords an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1 for PDH. • The highly dispersed Pt sites are responsible for the high specific activity for PDH. • The In species significantly enhances the catalytic activity and PDH selectivity. • The K+ has improved the stability of the catalyst and promoted the dispersion of Pt.
Abstract Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been a promising method to satisfy the increasing demand for propylene, but Pt-based catalysts always suffer from sintering and coke formation. Developing stable and efficient catalysts for PDH is of great significance for the industry. Herein, the paper reports that a catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite works as an efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. The catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene and an extremely high propylene productivity of 20.33mol with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.75h1. No obvious deactivation occurs after 48h on stream, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation. The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst with excellent activity and stability is potential for industrial application.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] . Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production. The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts [6] , which have been widely applied for industrial PDH processes. However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts [7] . The Pt-based catalysts tend to sinter and are inevitably deactivated due to carbon deposition at such a high temperature. Meanwhile, large ensembles of Pt species are active in structure-sensitive side reactions, including catalytic cracking and deep dehydrogenation [8] . Alloying active metal Pt with metal additives has been a conventional approach to enhance the catalytic performance and prolong the catalyst lifetime. Common metal additives, including Ga [9] , Sn [10] ,[11] , Zn [12] ,[13] , In [14] , Cu [15] ,[16] , Ge [17] , have been applied to dilute large Pt ensembles in order to prevent side reactions and improve propene selectivity. The introduction of metal additives results in the electronic transfer from additives to Pt, and an increase in the electron density of Pt promotes propylene desorption. Nevertheless, isolated Pt sites or Pt clusters still suffer from sintering during the PDH conversions at high temperatures on account of the increase in surface free energy and the absence of strong metal-support interactions. Developing catalysts with high stability under harsh conditions is of a great challenge but necessary.
Zeolites, with ordered pore structures, high surface area and high thermal stability, are suitable to be carriers for anchoring clusters [18] ,[19] . Conventional impregnation methods for supporting metal species on zeolites usually produce large size particles with poor dispersion. Recently, encapsulating subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites has been considered an effective method to inhibit sintering and enhance the stability of the catalysts. Corma et al. encapsulated subnanometric Pt and Pt-Sn clusters in the channel of S-1 with a highly stable ability for PDH [20] . Some OH of S-1 was replaced by -O-K+ species and the -O-K+ species could restrict the movement of Pt and Pt-Sn clusters, demonstrating that K+ played a significant role in improving the stability of the catalysts. Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600 [12] . However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc. Exploring and constructing zeolites containing In species are desirable for potential catalytic applications. Also, indium species have been reported as an additive to enhance the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation and reduce the acidity of catalysts, which can efficiently dilute large Pt ensembles and restrict side reactions. Zheng Wang et al reported that Pt-In bimetallic nanoparticles supported on SBA-15 were applied to the propane dehydrogenation where Indium species restrained coke formation and improved propene selectivity [21] . Christina W. Li et al. utilized colloidal methods to synthesize PtIn and PtGa nanoparticles with controlled bimetallic composition supported on SiO2 for nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation [9] . The In-rich PtIn2 catalyst on SiO2 support exhibits the highest reaction rate for the EDH reaction at 600  owing to the geometric modification by indium atoms. These investigations encourage us to design a Pt-In catalyst with efficient and stable performance for PDH and study the influence of indium addition on the catalytic activity for PDH. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is especially suitable for introducing indium into zeolite to alloy with Pt, which can form chelates with many metals to inhibit them from precipitating under alkaline conditions [19] ,[20] . We combine the confinement of zeolites and the modification of indium to construct a more efficient catalyst for practical industrial application.
In the present work, we describe a catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1. S-1 with the MFI topological structure has no acidity and is beneficial for inhibiting the carbon deposition during PDH, featuring a channel of 5.6×5.1Å (a little larger than propane, 4.7Å), which is conducive to the activation of propane [22] ,[23] . 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 exhibits outstanding activity, high selectivity and super stability for PDH. The catalyst still maintains near 40% propane conversion after 48h on stream with a deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. The additive indium improves the propylene selectivity by modifying the platinum electronic structure, and the introduction of K+ into zeolite can enhance the stability by restricting the movement of Pt. Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1 have a good prospect for industrial application for propane dehydrogenation.

Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites were synthesized at 170C for 3days. The molar composition of the initial gel was TEOS: TPAOH: H2O=1: 0.4: 35 [12] .
Typically, 7.5g of DI water were added into 6.5g of TPAOH solution (25wt%). After stirring for 30min, 4.5mL of TEOS was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at 800rpm. Then the gel was transferred to the oven and crystallized at 170  for 3days under a static condition. The solid was centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times, and then dried 70  in the oven overnight, followed by calcination at 550  for 6h to remove the template.

2.3. Catalyst characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα (γ=1.5406Å) radiation in the 2θ range of 5-50 with a scan speed of 10 min1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM images were acquired via high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) on a Tecnai G2 F30 microscope and FEI Titan Themis 60300. All catalysts were reduced in 20vol% H2/N2 at 550  for 1h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.8eV. The surface area and pore volume were analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460M nitrogen adsorption instrument after the samples were degassed at 350C for 8h under vacuum. The content of Pt, In and K was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 720ES instrument.
Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were carried out on a NETZSCH STA499 F3 in air at a heating rate of 10Cmin1 from room temperature to 800C.
H2-TPR measurement was conducted on an Autosorb-iQ analyzer (Quanta chrome Instruments, equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs)). 0.2g catalyst was treated in He (50mLmin1) at 550C for 1h. The temperature was increased from 50 to 800C with a heating rate of 10Cmin1 in 20vol% H2/Ar (30mLmin1). H2 pulse chemisorption measurement was conducted on an AutoChemII2920 analyzer (Micromeritics) equipped with TCDs. 0.1g catalyst was pretreated in an Ar atmosphere (50mLmin1) at 550C for 1h. When the temperature dropped to 50C, the gas flow was switched back to a 10vol% H2/Ar (50mLmin1) atmosphere at room temperature and the pulse measurement was started. The signal was collected by TCD.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was conducted on a Thermo Scientific NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000400cm1 by using coaddition of 64 scans. 10mg catalyst mixed with dried KBr powder was pressed into a disc with a diameter of 1cm and transferred to the sample holder and recorded by FTIR at room temperature.
FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption on the catalysts was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer furnished with an (in situ) cell. Typically, 10mg of catalyst mixed with KBr was carefully transferred into the in-situ cell and was pretreated at 400C for 4h under a vacuum of 10-2 Pa and then cooled down to room temperature. The catalysts were saturated with pyridine vapor and then evacuated at 20, 200, and 300C for 30min. Spectra were measured at an evacuation temperature in the range of 17001400cm1 by using coaddition with 64 scans. The amount of the Lewis acid sites in the samples was determined from the characteristic band at ca. 1450cm1.
In situ CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (in situ CO-DRIFT) were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 instrument equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector. Typically, 100mg of catalyst was carefully transferred into the in-situ cell and reduced by 20vol% H2/N2 (30mLmin1) at 550C for 1h. Subsequently, the catalyst was exposed to Ar until it cooled down to room temperature and the background spectrum was collected. Afterward, the catalyst contacted with a flow of CO for 60min followed by purging Ar until the background spectrum had no change. The data were collected at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30min to get the spectrum.
Temperature-programmed experiments were all carried out with a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. For C3H8-TPSR tests, 100mg of the catalyst was reduced in 550  for 1h in a stream of 20vol% H2/N2 (35mLmin1) with a heating rate of 10  min1 to 550  and then cooled down to 50 , and then transferred to a stream of 25vol% C3H8/N2 (25mLmin1) with a heating rate of 5  min1 to 650 . The output products were measured via the mass spectrometer (MS) instantaneously. For C3H6-TPD experiments, 100mg of the catalyst was reduced in the flowing of 10vol% H2/Ar at 550  for 1h. Then, the catalyst was cooled down to 100 . Subsequently, the adsorption of C3H6 was achieved by introducing 25vol% C3H6/N2 (30mLmin1) for 30min, and then the system was purged with He for 60min. After that, the temperature was raised to 900  in He atmosphere at 10  min1 and the signal was collected by mass spectrometer.
The data of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were collected at room temperature in the fluorescent mode with a Lytle detector at beamline BL14W1 and BL15U1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, China).
2.4. Catalytic testing
The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular fixed-bed reactor with a 7mm inner diameter at atmospheric pressure. Before the dehydrogenation reaction, 0.1g of catalyst (2040 mesh) mixed with 0.9g of quartz sand was reduced at 550C under a 20vol% H2/N2 atmosphere with 30mLmin1 for 1h, and then fed with propane. Typically, the reaction gas contained 25vol% propane and a balance gas of N2 (total flow rate of 25mLmin1), which gave a WHSV of 6.75h1. The product gas was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (PANNA A60) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Al2O3 Plot column). The analysis condition of the gas chromatograph: Oven temperature (100 ); Sample inlet temperature (180 ); Detector temperature (250 ); N2 gas flow (63mLmin1); H2 gas flow (60mLmin1); Air gas flow (300mLmin1). The catalytic performance test was also performed at different WHSVs: WHSV=13.5h1 (0.05g of catalyst mixed with 0.95g quartz sand, C3H8/N2=6.75/18.25mLmin1); WHSV=27h1 (0.025g of catalyst mixed with 0.975g quartz sand, C3H8/N2=6.75/18.25mLmin1); The C3H8 conversion, the selectivity of C3H6, and carbon balance were calculated by the following equations [24] :(1) (2) (3) The turnover frequency (TOF) and propylene formation rate were, calculated by Eq4 and 5, respectively:(4) (5) Where , X, and Y are the relative amount of the product i, the conversion of C3H8, and the selectivity of C3H6, respectively. is the outlet flow rate of the product i. is the inlet flow rate of ;,, Dis. and represent the weight of the catalysts, the weight percent of supported Pt in the catalyst, the dispersion of Pt and the Pt atomic weight, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization
3.1.1. Structural and morphology information
The synthesis process of Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1 is illustrated in Fig. 1 a. The catalysts were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method and the metal species were encapsulated in S-1 during the crystallization process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cs-corrected high-angle annular darkfield scanning (HAADF-STEM) images of the catalysts were shown in Fig. 1 b-e and Fig. S1 . Metal nanoclusters were uniformly dispersed inner part of S-1 crystals (250nm) with an average size of around 1.5nm, and scarce clusters or particles were observed outside of S-1. The clusters are larger than the size of the channels, which attributed that clusters could migrate along the channels during the calcination. Some observed nanoclusters which appeared larger than the MFI channels are located within the channels of MFI and don't block up the channels ( Fig. 1 d) [25] . The corresponding EDS mapping images ( Fig. 1 f) indicated that Pt and In species were evenly dispersed in S-1. We have discovered some Pt-In alloys in TEM images ( Fig. S2 ), which had a lattice spacing of 0.244nm corresponding to the crystal plane (2 0 0) of Pt3In2.Download: Download high-res image (1MB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1.

(f) Elemental mappings for Si, O, Pt, and In of 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 catalyst.The XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 a and Fig. S3 . Typical characteristic diffraction lines at 7.96, 8.82 and 23.27 of the MFI topology (PDF#440496) were observed in all samples. No noticeable characteristic peaks at 39.76 and 46.24 corresponding to Pt species (PDF#040802) and 21.50, 30.58 and 35.47 ascribed to In2O3 species (PDF#060416) were detected, indicating that no large nanoclusters existed in the synthesized catalysts [26] . The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms suggested a well-preserved microporous structure of MFI ( Fig. 2 b and Table S1 ). Compared with S-1, the BET surface area and pore volume of zeolites had little change, and enough microporous volumes (>0.1cm3/g) with sufficient microporous areas (>268m2/g) could guarantee the interaction between propane and catalysts. To analyze the chemical environment of indium species in zeolite, the evolution of the silanol groups was monitored by infrared spectroscopy ( Fig. 2 c). The peaks at 37003750cm1 ascribed to Si-OH decreased significantly after the introduction of Pt or In species into S-1, demonstrating that the In and Pt species were stabilized by the Si-OH groups [27] ,[28] . Generally, reducing the indium species embedding into the framework of S-1 is more difficult than In2O3 under the same condition. For 0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. 2 d), two reduction peaks located at around 350  and 725  are assigned to the reduction of In2O3 and the In species embedding into the MFI zeolite framework, respectively [24] ,[29] . Most Pt species in 0.5PtK@S-1 can be reduced under 500 , and the peak at around 570  is attributed to the Pt species stabilized by oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework. For 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1, a broad peak before 600  is attributed to the reduction of Pt species, and a new peak is located at around 800  in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1, which might be ascribed to the interaction between platinum and indium [24] .Download: Download high-res image (494KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2.

(d) H2-TPR profiles of 0.5PtK@S-1, 0.5InK@S-1 and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 catalysts after calcination at 550  for 6h.In order to further confirm the metal species encapsulated in S-1, probe reaction of selective reductions of nitrobenzene (4.6×6.47Å) and 1,3-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene (7.2×6.6Å) were performed ( Fig. S4 and S5 ) [22] . As seen, nitrobenzene could well enter the channels of S-1 (5.6×5.1Å) and react with Pt species confined in S-1, the size of 1,3-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene is larger than that of the channel of S-1, which could not get in touch with Pt species. 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 exhibited an excellent catalytic activity on nitrobenzene, but it showed an awful catalytic activity for 1,3-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene under the same reaction conditions. These results suggested that most metal species were encapsulated in S-1 rather than on the surface of the S-1.The electronic environment of Pt and In species in zeolite is very crucial for PDH progress. To further understand the detailed structural information, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ CO adsorbed Fourier-transform infrared (in situ CO-FTIR) and XPS measurements were performed. Based on EXAFS analysis ( Fig. 3 a), the oxidation state and metal state of Pt species existed in 0.5PtK@S-1 and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1, which attributed that Pt clusters in zeolite tend to be oxidized in air and/or be stabilized by bonding with oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework. In R space ( Fig. 3 b), Pt foil exhibits a typical first shell PtPt pair at about 2.55Å, while PtO bond in PtO2 is located at 1.67Å, no obvious peaks assigned to Pt-Pt bonds were found in 0.5PtK@S-1 and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1, confirming that the Pt species in S-1 were in high dispersion [30] ,[31] . The fitting results of the Pt L3-edge of EXAFS spectra of various catalysts were listed in Table S2 , Fig. S6 and Fig. S7 . After the introduction of indium, the average coordination number (CN) of Pt-Pt bonds decrease from 6.4 to 4, demonstrating that the metal additives diluted Pt ensembles [32] . The above results suggested that Pt species were made up of atomically dispersed Pt with some nanoclusters. The XANES and EXAFS measurements of the prepared catalysts were conducted under atmosphere conditions and Pt clusters might be partially oxidized in air. The present state of Pt species in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 was further confirmed by in situ CO-DRIFTS under the reduction atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 3 c, the stable bands at 2102, 2030 and 2012cm1 represented the adsorption bands ascribed to Pt species after Ar purging. The peak at 2102cm1 was ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed on Ptδ+ single-atom sites [33] ,[34] , and the unique band centered at 2012cm1 and 2030cm1 could be assigned to the linearly bonded of CO on Pt species ensembling in In species [35] . For comparison, in situ CO-DRIFT spectra of 0.3Pt0.3InK/S-1 prepared by the impregnation method was shown in Fig. S8 , and the peak at 2045cm1 was attributed to the Pt particles. The results demonstrated that the Pt species encapsulated in S-1 were in high dispersion. XPS experiments were conducted to analyze the state of Pt and In species. The binding energy of Pt species in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. 3 d) was 71.0eV and 75.7eV, which were ascribed to Pt0 and Pt4+, respectively. The binding energy of Pt0 was lower than that (71.2eV) of 0.5PtK@S-1 ( Fig. S9 ), which confirmed the interaction between Pt with In species. The above results indicated that Pt species encapsulated in S-1 could not be reduced fully in H2 or tended to be oxidized in air. The binding energy of In species in 0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. 3 e) was 444.8eV and 445.6eV, which was ascribed to In2O3 and In3+ species in S-1, respectively [29] . The increase of the binding energy of In3+ species in 0.5InK@S-1 was attributed to the electron transfer from indium species to the S-1 framework, demonstrating that the In species embedded into the MFI zeolite framework. After introducing Pt into the S-1, the metallic state of indium formed and the binding energy of In3+ in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 was 445.3eV ( Fig. 3 f), which was 0.3eV lower than that in 0.5InK@S-1. The decrease of the binding energy of In 3d is attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt species. The above results revealed that part of the indium species has been incorporated into the framework of S-1 and the electronic transfer between Pt and In existed.Download: Download high-res image (527KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 3.

3.2. Catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation
The catalytic performances of these catalysts for PDH were investigated at 550C without H2 atmosphere at the WHSV of 6.75h1. As displayed in Fig. 4 a, b and Table S3 &S4, 0.5PtK@S-1 exhibited little catalytic activity and the propane conversion decreased from 27.29% to 0.56% after 6h on stream, affording a deactivation constant as fast as 0.7h1. The introduction of indium species resulted in a distinct increase in propylene selectivity and catalytic stability, and the best performance was achieved as the mass fraction of indium species was increased to 0.5%. Further increasing the indium species, the propane conversion increased slightly. 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 gave an initial propane conversion of 43.7% with a propene selectivity of 97.1%, and the catalytic performance kept unchanged after 20h on stream. We found that potassium had a vital influence on the stability of the catalyst, which was then investigated in depth ( Fig. S10 ). In the absence of potassium, 0.5Pt0.5In@S-1 catalyst had a terrible performance for PDH, with propane conversion decreasing from 32.8% to 25.2% after 6h of operation. Although the catalytic activity was improved with increasing the content of indium species, the catalyst without potassium was unstable. The average size of the particles encapsulated in S-1 decreased from 4nm to 1.5nm when the potassium was added ( Fig. S11 ). Apparently, the introduction of potassium into the synthesis gel further reduced the size of the Pt species and improved the activity and stability of the catalyst, which was attributed to the fact that potassium might reduce some voids in the channel and restrict the movement of Pt species at high temperatures. For comparison, the commercial catalyst PtSnK/Al2O3 was also evaluated under the same condition with 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. S12 ) [8] . The propane conversion decreased from 28.9% to 6.9% after 15h on stream. For 0.3Pt0.3InK/S-1 prepared by the impregnation method, the propane conversion dropped rapidly from 40.2% to 36.1% after 20h of reaction, affording a deactivation constant of 0.0087h1 ( Fig. S13 ). Moreover, PDH experiments were also tested over 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 at 550C under different WHSVs ( Fig. 4 c). The higher WHSV shortened the contact time between propane and the catalyst, contributing to a decrease in catalytic activity. Propane conversion decreased from 43.7% to 28.1% with an increase in the WHSV from 6.75 to 27h1, and the catalyst still achieved a propane conversion of 25.1% with 98.9% selectivity of propene at a high WHSV of 27h1, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent performance under the high WHSVs. With an increase in the reaction temperature from 500  to 600  ( Fig. S14 ), the propane conversion increased from 26.7% to 61.2%, and the propylene selectivity decreased from 97.7% to 96.6%. Higher temperatures enhance the yield of propylene, but this is accompanied by a decrease in the stability of the catalyst [36] . In order to further confirm the stability of the catalysts, a long-term stability test and the recycling stability test were conducted. During the long-term stability test ( Fig. 4 d), the catalyst showed an excellent performance with a propane conversion of 41.8% and 95.7% selectivity of propylene, and the propane conversion maintained at 39.2% with a propylene selectivity of 99.5% after 48h on stream (WHSV=6.75h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. In the recycling stability test ( Fig. 4 e), the propane conversion decreased slightly and finally remained at 37.0% after three cycles of regeneration. Compared with other catalysts reported in the references, the catalyst in this work had a considerable advantage ( Fig. 4 f and Table S6 ). PDH experiments were also carried out over 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 under industrial conditions, and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 achieved an initial propane conversion of 35.2% with 81.3% selectivity of propene. The propane conversion remained essentially the same, while propylene selectivity was significantly improved to 95.6% after 20h of reaction, showing that the catalyst has an unexceptionable prospect for industrial application ( Fig. S15 ).

3.3. The discussion on the improved catalytic activity and stability
C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR) and temperature-programmed desorption analysis of propene (C3H6-TPD) experiences were conducted to investigate the excellent activity and stability of the catalyst. The activation temperature of the initial CH cleavage was about 172  on 0.5PtK@S-1 and 250  on 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. 5 a), respectively, suggesting that Pt species might be the active component and indium species functioned as the promoter. The introduction of indium species restricted the cracking and deep dehydrogenation reactions, which could give rise to the formation of CH4. C3H6-TPD helped understand the interaction of propylene with active sites ( Fig. 5 b). The desorption temperature of propylene on 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 was 335.7 , which was lower than that (359.5 ) on 0.5PtK@S-1. A relatively weak interaction between propylene and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 was exhibited, and no desorption peaks were detected when the temperature was higher than 400 . The increased electron donation from In to Pt species could promote the desorption of propene on the electron-rich Pt species [36] .

(c) NH3-TPD profiles of the prepared catalysts. (d) TG curves of the spent catalysts after reaction.The acidity of zeolite is of great importance for PDH and excessive acidity will bring about the carbon deposition on the catalysts, which eventually lead to the deactivation of catalysts·NH3-TPD experiments ( Fig. 5 c) were conducted to analyze the acidity of catalysts and NH3 desorption peaks at the temperatures (>400 , 200400  and<200 ) could be divided into the strong, medium and weak acid sites. Clearly, no strong acid sites existed in the catalysts due to the low acidity of S-1, and the introduction of In species in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 resulted in a significant decrease in the peak intensity at 200250  compared with 0.5PtK@S-1. Indium could reduce the acidity of the catalyst significantly owing to the electronic transfer between Pt and In. Furthermore, TG analysis was used to evaluate the coke amount of the spent catalysts ( Fig. 5 d). 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 had a slight weight loss of 0.9% after 48h on stream, which was less than that (2.4%) on PtSnK/Al2O3 after 20h on stream. On account of the low acidity and the electronic transfer between Pt and In species, 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 had excellent resistance to carbon deposition. Pyridine as a probe molecule could distinguish Brnsted acid sites (1637 and 1540cm1) and Lewis acid sites (1620 and 1450cm1) in the FTIR spectrum ( Fig. 6 a, b). The bands at 1610cm1 and 1490cm1 ascribed to Lewis acid sites indicated that part of In species embedded into the MFI zeolite framework, and the band at 1445cm1 are assigned to the interaction of pyridine with H atoms of the SiOH groups in the silanol nests [23] ,[28] . The quantified acidity value of 0.5InK@S-1 was 28.81μmol/g at 200C and 15.88μmol/g at 300C. Compared with 0.5InK@S-1, the quantified acidity value of 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 decreased to 10.82μmol/g at 200  and 6.33μmol/g at 300 , which were attributed to the coverage of Pt species on the In sites in the framework of S-1 and silanol nests. The indium sites in the framework and silanol nests played a great role in anchoring Pt species and preventing the active sites from sintering [27] .Download: Download high-res image (206KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 6. (a, b) Pyridine IR spectra of 0.5PtK@S-1 and 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 at 200C and 300C.The spent catalysts had been characterized to investigate the chemical state of Pt and In species before and after the reaction. Most metal species were still well encapsulated in S-1 and no obvious agglomeration was observed in the spent 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 after 20h on stream, which confirmed the high stability of 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 ( Fig. S16 ). XPS experiments were conducted for the spent catalysts after 20h on stream ( Fig. 7 ). The binding energy of Pt species in 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 increased from 71.0eV to 71. 7eV and the binding energy of indium species increased, which was attributed to the slight aggregation of Pt-In particles. The little change in the binding energy of the spent catalyst reflected the high stability for PDH, which was ascribed to the confinement of zeolite and the modification of In to Pt species.Download: Download high-res image (299KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 7. (a, b) XPS spectra of Pt 4f and In 3d of the spent 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 after 20h on stream, respectively.Based on the above findings, the excellent activity and stability of the catalyst are attributed to the confinement of S-1, the modification of indium species and the regulation of K+. First, the high dispersion of Pt species in S-1 has been demonstrated in Cs-corrected STEM-HAADF, XANES, EXAFS and in situ CO-DRIFT. The probe reaction has demonstrated that the Pt-In clusters are well encapsulated in S-1 rather than on the outside of S-1, and no obvious agglomeration is observed after 20h on stream owing to the confinement of S-1. Second, based on XPS, C3H6-TPD, TPSR and TG analysis, the introduction of indium species into S-1 can modify the geometric and electronic features of Pt species, and increase the electron donation from indium species to Pt species, which is beneficial to prevent the electron-rich propene and coke precursors, thus the propene selectivity and the stability are enhanced. Third, K+ occupies the channels of S-1 and restricts the migration of Pt species along the channels. Taken together, the catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In clusters encapsulated in S-1 exhibits an outstanding performance for PDH and is promising for the further application in industrial processes.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully design a catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1. S-1 zeolite with ordered pore structures significantly reduces the size of Pt-In clusters and improves the anti-sintering ability. 0.5Pt0.5InK@S-1 exhibits a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene, and achieves an extremely high propylene production rate (20.33mol ) with a WHSV of 6.75h1. No obvious deactivation is observed after 48h on stream, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. The synergistic effect of the confinement of zeolites and the modification of indium greatly enhances the catalytic activity of catalysts, which is potential for practical industrial applications.
