[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[2] "The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 showed excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "The fabrication of such metal-nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites, however, is not straightforward. Due to high surface free energy of the metal species, they tend to agglomerate and precipitate very fast, in particular, under harsh conditions of zeolite synthesis (e.g., strong alkalinity and high temperature); whereas the crystallization of zeolites typically takes a much longer time."
[4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
[5] "The high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."

1.The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This strategy leads to the ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant, as the resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibits excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, demonstrating the success of the ultrafast encapsulation method.

1.由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速沸石的结晶来解决直接合成金属封装过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，使其与纳米团簇的快速形成同步。这种策略导致金属纳米团簇在几分钟内就地封装到沸石中。对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn团簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的，因为得到的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯中表现出优异的稳定性和活性。即使在高温下多次反应和再生循环后，催化剂的高活性和选择性仍能保持，证明了超快速封装方法的成功。
