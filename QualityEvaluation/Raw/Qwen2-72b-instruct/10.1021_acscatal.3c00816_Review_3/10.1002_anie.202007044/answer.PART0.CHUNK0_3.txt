[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[2] "The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 showed excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
[4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
[5] "Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."

1.The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This enables an ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 shows excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with ultrasmall Pt clusters formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization. The catalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity in the industrially important reaction for propene production, and the high activity and selectivity can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures.

1.由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速沸石的结晶以与纳米团簇的快速形成同步，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这使得金属纳米团簇在几分钟内就能在沸石中实现超快速原位封装。对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn团簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的。所得的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯中表现出优异的稳定性和活性，超小的Pt团簇在高硅ZSM-5沸石结晶的同时形成并同时被封装。催化剂在工业上重要的丙烯生产反应中表现出高活性和选择性，即使在高温下多次反应和再生循环后，高活性和选择性仍能保持。
