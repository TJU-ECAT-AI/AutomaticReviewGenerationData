[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[2] "The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 showed excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
[4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
[5] "Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."

1.The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This strategy enables the ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 shows excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with high conversion and selectivity maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures. This demonstrates the success of the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization.

1.由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速沸石的结晶以与纳米团簇的快速形成同步，解决了直接合成金属封装过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这种策略使金属纳米团簇在几分钟内就能在原位封装到沸石中。对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn团簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的。所得的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯方面表现出优异的稳定性和活性，即使在高温下多次反应和再生循环后，仍能保持高转化率和选择性。这证明了在沸石结晶过程中金属团簇的超快速封装的成功。
