The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This strategy leads to the ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibits excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with exceptional selectivity and stability even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures. The role of Sn in modulating the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor affects the size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters, leading to improved catalytic performance in propane conversion.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing the in situ encapsulation of PtSn clusters with approximately 1 nm size inside high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure. This results in a Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst with superior catalytic stability, as evidenced by its propane conversion remaining at 45% after 24 hours in the PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

Yu et al. developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor, which allows complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170 C, or 2 minutes at 190 C. This ultrafast crystallization rate enables the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The Pt loadings in the silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. The Sn species transform into amorphous SnO2 initially and then into Td Sn species within the zeolite framework, which improves Pt dispersion. By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.
