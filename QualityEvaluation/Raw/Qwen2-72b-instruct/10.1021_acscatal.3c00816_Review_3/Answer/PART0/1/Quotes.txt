          [4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
          [5] "Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."
          [6] "The fabrication of such metal-nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites, however, is not straightforward.

          [2] "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace."
