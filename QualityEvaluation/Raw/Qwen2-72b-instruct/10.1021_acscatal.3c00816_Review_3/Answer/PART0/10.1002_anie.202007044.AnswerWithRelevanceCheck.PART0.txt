          [1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
          [2] "The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 showed excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
          [3] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
          [4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
          [5] "Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success."
          [6] "The fabrication of such metal-nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites, however, is not straightforward. Due to high surface free energy of the metal species, they tend to agglomerate and precipitate very fast, in particular, under harsh conditions of zeolite synthesis (e.g., strong alkalinity and high temperature); whereas the crystallization of zeolites typically takes a much longer time."
          [7] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
          [8] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

          The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This strategy leads to the ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibits excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with exceptional selectivity and stability even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures. The role of Sn in modulating the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor affects the size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters, leading to improved catalytic performance in propane conversion.

          由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速沸石的结晶以与纳米团簇的快速形成同步，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种策略导致金属纳米团簇在几分钟内就地封装到沸石中。对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn团簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的。所得的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5在丙烷脱氢转化为丙烯中表现出优异的稳定性和活性，具有优异的选择性和稳定性，即使在高温下多次反应和再生循环后也是如此。Sn在调节Pt前体与沸石前体之间的相互作用方面的作用影响了Pt纳米团簇的大小和分散，从而提高了丙烷转化的催化性能。
