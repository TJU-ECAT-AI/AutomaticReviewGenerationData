The development of an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to address the time-scale mismatch challenges in metal site encapsulation, particularly for PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy enables the rapid and precise incorporation of metal clusters into the zeolite framework, significantly enhancing the catalyst's structure and performance. By overcoming the traditional limitations of slow crystallization processes, this method ensures that the metal clusters are uniformly dispersed and stabilized within the zeolite pores, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The ultrafast crystallization technique not only accelerates the synthesis of metal-encapsulated zeolites but also opens new avenues for the design of advanced catalysts with tailored properties, promising enhanced efficiency in various chemical transformations. This innovation represents a significant leap in the field of catalysis, offering a versatile tool for the optimization of industrial processes.
