[1] "Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure.93 In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C."

1.The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing the in situ encapsulation of PtSn clusters with approximately 1 nm size inside high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure. This results in a Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst with superior catalytic stability, as evidenced by its propane conversion remaining at 45% after 24 hours in the PDH reaction at 600 degrees Celsius.

1.由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过允许PtSn簇（约1纳米大小）通过快速的一步合成程序在高硅ZSM-5沸石内原位封装，解决了金属封装直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这导致Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂具有优越的催化稳定性，因为在600摄氏度的PDH反应中24小时后，其丙烷转化率仍保持在45%。
