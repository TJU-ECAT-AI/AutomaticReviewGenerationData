Abstract
Ni-based catalysts using siliceous materials as the supports have suffered from two challenging issues of sintering and carbon deposition for dry reforming of methane (DRM), resulted from a weak metal-support interaction. Given these, a novel metal–acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is tailored from the evolution of hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates that are formed by subtly controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes in the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The developed Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst renders almost equivalent CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1) and superb long-term stability during 100 h with no activity loss at 750 °C with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat−1·h−1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation. Such superior catalytic behavior benefits from the synergy between highly uniform Ni nanoparticles (3–5 nm) confined in the micropores of zeolite and substantially formed Lewis acid sites due to coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites located at the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate, as revealed by detailed characterizations. Meanwhile, it further discloses that a benign balance between formation and elimination of “process carbon” species is responsible for improving the carbon resistance of catalyst during the DRM reaction. The present design broadens a new insight for the development of new Ni-based catalysts with simultaneous coking- and sintering-resistant for the DRM application.

1. Introduction
The emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as notorious greenhouse gases has been a severe environmental issue that contributes significantly to the global warming and climate change. Given this, dry reforming of methane (DRM, CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 + 2CO, ΔH0 298 K= +247 kJ/mol) as a prospective benign process provides an effective way to transform them into valuable syngas that can be further converted into the assorted chemicals through adjustable H2/CO ratio

. However, two inescapable challenges of sintering and carbon deposition causing the gradual deactivation of catalysts need to be faced at high operating temperatures.
To overcome the above issues, Ni-based catalysts with multifarious structures have been designed and prepared by the spatial confinement effect and/or metal-support interaction. In popular, the assorted catalysts with core–shell

[18]
,
[19]
, etc., have been widely fabricated by Ni nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated/embedded into various supports. Such catalysts perform a superior anti-sintering ability of Ni NPs than supported catalysts. For instance, Kawi's group
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
have developed a series of core–shell catalysts (e.g., Ni-Yolk@Ni@SiO2, Ni@SiO2 and silica@Ni@silica, etc.) that exhibited a better DRM performance than that of Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Unsatisfactorily, the coke deposition has not been effectively mitigated during the DRM reaction, especially at a low temperature and a high-space-velocity. A fact has been identified that although the core–shell structure plays a beneficial role in the sintering resistance of Ni active phases, the shell layer tends to preferentially select the defect sites (e.g., unsaturated sites, the surface vertices, edges and steps) adsorbed to the active phase

[13]

[14]

[22]

[25]

[26]
, hindering the contact between the reactants and the active phase so as to reduce the catalytic efficiency of Ni. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of core–shell layer also affects the mass transfer of reactants, intermediates and products, resulting in more complex hydrocarbon reconstruction behaviors of carbon species intermediates
[10]

[27]

[29]
, such as the accumulation of Cα into Cβ, thus accelerating the carbon deposition rate.
Facing the above scenario, some significant efforts have been devoted to reduce the formation and/or accelerate the consumption of carbon species during the DRM reaction. At present, one strategy is that the carbon deposition can be mitigated appropriately by adjusting the size of Ni NPs
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
. For instance, Zhang et al.
[30]
have prepared Ni@SiO2 catalysts with different Ni particle sizes (ca. 1.4, 1.9 and 2.6 nm). The advantage is that the smaller the Ni NPs size, the less carbon deposition. Other scholars utilize the nature of supports or the introduction of additives (e.g., alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, etc.) to accelerate CO2 dissociation by building lattice oxygen (or surface oxygen) vacancies
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
, which also can be beneficial to eliminate carbon deposition. Given all of these, a novel attempt has been proposed in recent years that the electronic structure of surface Ni species (e.g., nickel phyllosilicate intermediates) can be tuned via a metal-support interaction
[34]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
, which might be conductive to reduce the carbon deposition.
As mentioned above, some researchers' sight begins to turn to zeolitic supports, which are mainly due to its regular channels, high (hydro)thermal stability and defect structure. More importantly, the zeolite has been a better candidate to confine the Ni NPs and also has a good CO2 affinity. Both of them might natively establish a beneficial micro-environment for the DRM reaction. In view of all these, pure silica zeolites (e.g., MFI
[42]
,
[43]
, MEL
[41]
,
[44]
and MWW
[45]
, etc.) as the appropriate supports can be employed to achieve the nickel phyllosilicate intermediates in synthesis and confinement of Ni NPs in composite structures with a better shell, which are designed to solve the problems of carbon deposition, metal Ni sintering and utilization. For instance, Sun et al.
[44]
have precisely controlled the size of Ni NPs in the silicalite-2 (S-2) zeolite through the metastable Ni-O···Si interficial structure. The results have found that the Ni NPs in the Ni@S-2 catalyst with a low Ni loading (0.3 wt%) showed an excellent catalytic stability with no carbon deposition. Considering the DRM reaction, a higher Ni loading is crucial to ensure a higher mass-specific reaction rate. However, the Ni NPs migrate to the external surface of zeolite as the increase in Ni loadings, accompanied with the formation of carbon species that is difficult to be eliminated during the DRM reaction
[42]
,
[43]
,
[46]
,
[47]
. Therefore, designing functionalized Ni species active phases in Ni-based zeolite catalyst will be imperative in building a benign balance between the formation and the consumption of “process carbon” species during the DRM reaction at low temperatures. Recently, Kong et al.
[48]
have designed a metal–acid bifunctional NiSi-PS catalyst that performed a superior low-temperature hydrogenolysis.
To meet the above situation, dual spatial confinement effect caused by a strong physical–chemical interaction among the active phase, the surface and the channel of support will be taken as a new breakthrough point. Different [Ni-O-Si-] stable polymerization structures (namely, nickel phyllosilicates) will be tailored by the interaction of Ni species with support in the high energy position of the siliceous zeolites, which ought to be employed to achieve the fabrication of bifunctional Ni species active phases, so that it will perform the abilities of sintering- and carbon-resistance. As expected, the catalytic activity and stability of the target catalyst will be improved.
Herein, we have precisely controlled the synthesis of Ni precursor complexes with different coordination states by adjusting the ratio of Ni2+ cations to organic ligands. Subsequently, smaller-sized Ni NPs (3–5 nm) embedded Ni phyllosilicate as a metal–acid bifunctional zeolite catalyst is tailored (cf.
Scheme 1
). The encapsulated Ni NPs in the micropore of silicalite-1 zeolite exhibits a highly anti-sintering and the ability to activate CH4. Meanwhile, the Ni phyllosilicate intermediates as the Lewis acid sites can adsorb and dissociate the CO2 to generate the active hydroxyls (oxygen) species that are beneficial for the elimination of “process carbon” species. Such a Ni-based catalyst with bifunctional Ni species active phases can build a benign balance between the formation and the elimination of “process carbon” species to improve the stability of DRM reaction at low temperatures.

Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, ≥ 98 %), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt% in H2O), ethylenediamine (En, ≥ 99 %) and pyridine (Py, ≥ 99.9 %) were supplied by Aladdin Chemical Reagent ltd.. Ni(NO3)·6H2O (>98 %) was purchased by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent ltd., China.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
2.2.1. Synthesis of [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor complexes
In this work, the [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively) were employed as the precursor complexes to enable the controllable fabrication of bifunctional Ni species active phases in zeolite crystal. Specifically, the Ni precursors with different coordination states were prepared by adding Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in the En aqueous solution under stirring at room temperature until complete dissolution. The molar ratio of Ni to En was 0.04, 0.09, 0.18 and 0.44, respectively.
2.2.2. Synthesis of Ni@S-1 bifunctional catalyst
The synthesis gel was prepared with a molar composition of TEOS: TPAOH: H2O: [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+=1: 0.4: 35: 1. Typically, 13.0 g TPAOH was added into 15 mL de-ionized water. After stirring for 0.5 h, 8.32 g TEOS was added into the above mixture. After stirring for another 6 h, TEOS was hydrolyzed completely. Afterwards, the prepared [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor was slowly dropped into the above solution and stirred for another 2 h. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and dynamically crystallized at 170 °C for 4 days. The resulting white solid was filtrated and washed with de-ionized water until pH of 7, dried at 80 °C for overnight, and then calcined in air at 550 °C for 8 h. The final samples were named as Nim@S-1, where m expressed the molar ratio of Ni to En. The corresponding Ni loadings were shown in

2.2.3. Synthesis of Ni/S-1 catalyst
S-1 zeolite was synthesized with a molar ratio of 1.0 TEOS: 0.4 TPAOH: 35 H2O. A specific procedure could be seen in our previous work
[49]
. The Ni/S-1 sample was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. As a typical case, the prepared [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ was dissolved in 10 mL de-ionized water and made 2 g S-1 disperse into the above solution. After rotation evaporation at 50 °C for 3 h, the sample was calcined at 550 °C for 8 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a D/MAXRB XRD instrument (Rigaku, Japan) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. Data were collected with a diffraction angle (2θ) ranged from 5 to 90°.
Ni loadings in the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, iCAP-6300, Thermo). Prior to the measurement, the sample was treated by the HF solution, and the dissolved mixtures were diluted to satisfy concentration detection range of the instrument.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were conducted at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Prior to the experiment, the sample was pre-treated at 350 °C in a vacuum for 6 h. The specific surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Titan G2 TF30 with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF) images were performed on a FISCHIONE electron microscopy.
Ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyzes were conducted on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Binding energy values of all the samples were calibrated based on a C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. Before the measurement, the sample was reduced at 750 °C and then was sealed in a quartz tube with an Ar protection.Liquid UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV–vis DR) spectra were obtained on a UV-1800PC spectrophotometer. Solid UV–vis DR spectra were collected on a TU-1901 spectrophotometer in the diffuse reflectance mode equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as the standard for solid samples.
Raman spectra were recorded on a HORIBA Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer equipped with an Ar+ excitation source (λ = 325 nm) at room temperature.
In situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of hydroxyls, CO adsorption and pyridine adsorption on the catalyst samples were measured on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectroscopy, respectively. The specific FTIR operational procedures could refer to our previous studies

.
H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst sample (ca. 50 mg) was pre-treated under an Ar flow rate of 20 mL·min−1 at 500 °C for 1 h, cooling to room temperature, and then a 10 % H2/Ar (30 mL·min−1) was introduced. H2-TPR profile was conducted from 40 to 850 °C with a heating rate of 10 oC·min−1.
H2 chemisorption was performed on a H2-Chem analyzer by H2 pulse experiments to measure Ni dispersion. Prior to measurement, the sample (ca. 100 mg) was H2 pre-treated at 750 °C for 1 h, followed by degassing treatment at the same temperature for 1 h to eliminate chemisorbed H2 and water. The isotherms were measured at room temperature. Estimated dispersion was based on spherical geometry and an adsorption stoichiometry of Ni/H = 1.
Differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA) was performed on a STA449F3 Jupiter instrument. The variation in the weight of spent sample (ca. 20 mg) was monitored by increasing the system temperature in air from 50 to 800 °C.
CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument to investigate the basic sites on the catalysts. The sample (ca. 100 mg) was taken into a U-tube and reduced at 750 °C for 1 h under a 10 % H2/Ar (30 mL·min−1) and then cooled to room temperature under He (30 mL·min−1). After that, CO2 (20 mL·min−1) was dosed into the system until adsorption saturation and then was purged with He (30 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Finally, the system temperature increased from 30 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 oC·min−1, and the CO2-TPD curve was recorded with a TCD detector.
In situ FTIR experiments were carried out on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectroscopy. Firstly, the sample (ca. 10–15 mg) was reduced at 750 °C for 0.5 h under a 10 % H2/Ar and then cooled to 50 °C. Subsequently, in situ FTIR experiments were conducted by in succession introducing the feed gas (CH4: CO2: N2 = 1: 1: 1, 25 mL·min−1) at a heating rate of 10 oC·min−1 from 50 to 700 °C. Each spectrum was recorded at an interval 50 °C.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The DRM reaction was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor. The reaction tube with a length of 45 cm, an outer diameter of 10 mm and an inner diameter of 6 mm was used. Prior to the reaction, all the catalysts (ca. 20 mg, 40 to 60 mesh) were reduced at 750 ℃ for 1 h with a 10 % H2 balanced with Ar (30 mL·min−1). Subsequently, the mixed gases consisted of CH4: CO2: N2 = 1: 1: 1 at a certain flow was passed into the reactor, and the DRM were conducted at different temperatures. Stability tests were performed as a function of time-on-stream at 650 and 750 °C, respectively. The reactants and products were on-line analyzed on a Fuli 9790II gas chromatography (GC) in combination with TCD and FID detectors, for the purpose of CH4, CO2, CO, and H2 on-line analysis. Samples were collected via an automated six-way valve containing a sample loop until at least three consecutive measurements were in the range of approximately 2 % error. Liquid products (i.e., H2O) generated from the reaction were removed from the outlet stream by a water trap cooled by an ice bath. The gas flow rate in the outlet of the reactor was measured using a bubble-flow meter in order to the CH4 conversion (

), CO2 conversion (

) and the H2/CO molar ratio (equation

), which were calculated as follows:

where F displayed the flow rate in the inlet (superscript “in”) and outlet (superscript “out”) of the reactor (mL·min−1), and the subscript was given the relevant gaseous reactants or products detected by GC.
2.5. Kinetic studies
Kinetic experiments were performed to determine the reaction rate, apparent activation energy and turnover frequency (TOF) of the DRM reaction. Specifically, differential reactors loaded with less amount of catalyst, a high WHSV (ignoring the pressure drop) and a low reaction temperature were employed to control the conversions lower than 15 % in order to eliminate the thermal and diffusion limitations (see
supplementary material
).

where mcat, wNi and MNi represented the weight of catalyst, the content of supported Ni in the catalyst and the Ni atomic weight, respectively. TOF value with respect to CH4 conversion rate (s−1) was calculated by using the results obtained from the reaction rate (r) and amount of exposed Ni atoms.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical environments of Ni precursors in solutions and catalysts
In this work, the coordination environments of Ni precursors in the solutions are modulated by changing the ratio of Ni2+ cations to the chelating ligand En, so that it can effectively tend to synthesize specific [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor complexes. During in situ crystallization, the precursors can be captured by the Si(OH)4 tetrahedra generated by the hydrolysis of TEOS, and it is beneficial to construct the functionalized Ni species in the S-1 after calcination and reduction.
Fig. 1
A shows the UV–vis DR spectra of the Ni precursors in the solutions. No obvious bands can be seen when the En ligands are dissolved in water solution. If only Ni2+ cations are added, two bands appear at 302 and 395 nm, which may be due to the π-π* transition of nitrate ions and the free Ni2+ cations in the solution, respectively. When the Ni2+ cations and En are blended, three new broad bands at 350, 543 and 888 nm are detected, which can be attributed to three spin-permissive d-d transitions of octahedral Ni2+ cations 3A2g → 3T2g(λ1), 3A2g → 3T1g(F)(λ2) and 3A2g → 3T1g(P)(λ3), respectively
[51]
,
[52]
. Though the [Ni(en)x(H2O)6-2x]2+ (x = 1, 2) shows a C2v symmetry, the lack of band splitting suggests that the average environment rule can be applied to these complexes. Thus, it can be suggested that the Ni precursors in the solutions ought to be mainly composed of [Ni(En)2(H2O)2]2+ and [Ni(En)3]2+ complexes. With the increasing of Ni/En ratio in the solution, the area ratio (A888/A543) of the bands at 888 and 543 nm also increases (cf.
Fig. 1
A, inset), while no obvious blue or red shift can be observed. The result means that the relative proportion of [Ni(En)2(H2O)2]2+ and [Ni(En)3]2+ in the solution is subtly controlled, rather than the change in the bonding between the ligand and the Ni2+ cations.

(C) Possible location and interaction of [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor complexes in the Ni@S-1 zeolite.
To further illustrate the effect of Ni precursor complexes on the fabrication of Ni species active phases, the catalyst samples before and after calcination are subjected to the FTIR spectroscopy (cf.
Fig. 1
B). For the uncalcined S-1, four obvious infrared absorption bands at 455, 555, 808 and 1063 cm−1 are observed, all of which belong to the symmetric or asymmetric stretching vibration of Si-O-Si structure in MFI zeolite
[40]
,
[42]
. After calcination, all the above characteristic bands do not shift significantly, indicating that the presence of TPAOH does not cause the change in the MFI framework. However, the skeletal vibration bands on the Ni0.04@S-1 and Ni0.44@S-1 samples are obvious offset in the presence of [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ complexes. The band belonged to the Si-O-Si structure located in the five- or six-membered rings shifts from 545 to 555 cm−1, representing the formation of Ni species in the zeolitic channels
[41]
,
[43]
, which might be related to the [Ni(En)3]2+ complexes. Noteworthily, the position of such IR band in the samples is consistent with S-1 sample, suggesting that the above formed Ni species may be weakly embedded into the MFI framework. However, the band at 1063 cm−1 ascribed to the Si-O-Si structure shifts to the high frequency band at 1106 cm−1 due to the presence of [Ni(En)2(H2O)2]2+ complexes, meaning the formation of Ni-O-Si structure. During in situ synthesis, the H2O ligand of this complex is more likely to be replaced by the surface [Si-O−] group to form the [Ni(En)2(SiO)2] structure by grafting reaction (cf.
Fig. 1
C), so that the water-containing ligand can no longer react with other Ni complexes or Si-containing species.
3.2. Structural characterizations of catalysts
Fig. S1
provides the XRD patterns of all synthesized catalysts. Typical characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to the MFI structure can be observed. Additionally, no diffraction peaks related to NiO can be detected for the Ni@S-1 samples, which ought to be anticipated owing to the highly dispersion of Ni species. With respect to the Ni0.44/S-1 catalyst, a new diffraction peak appears at 2θ = 43.1° ascribed to the [2 0 0] crystal plane of NiO
[11]
,
[30]
,
[53]
, meaning the formation of large aggregated Ni clusters on the catalyst.
Fig. S2
a depicts the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the catalysts. It can be seen that all the samples show typical I-type isotherms, confirming the presence of micropores
[40]
,
[42]
,
[43]
. As shown in
Table 1
, a slight decline in the micropore area and micropore volume of Ni@S-1 catalysts can be found, suggesting that the Ni species ought to be embedded into the layered wall of micropores. While, such changes do not influence the distributions of micropore and mesopore size (cf.
Fig. S2
b and S2c), further reflecting the highly dispersion of Ni species. Noteworthily, the mesopore volume of Ni0.18@S-1 and Ni0.44@S-1 are enlarged slightly, which might reduce the steric hindrance and facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants and products. For the Ni0.44/S-1, the specific surface area decreases obviously, while no change in the pore volume can be found, suggesting that the Ni clusters might be mainly distributed onto the external surface.

The morphologies and Ni NPs size distributions of reduced catalysts are determined by STEM-HAADF (cf.
Fig. 2
). It can be seen that the average size of Ni NPs is about 3–4 nm when the Ni loading is less than 1 wt% (Ni/En ≤ 0.09). Even if the Ni loading is up to 5 wt% (Ni/En = 0.44), the average size of Ni NPs is only up to around 5 nm. The corresponding Ni dispersion of all the Ni@S-1 catalysts can reach above 20 % (cf.
Table 1
), measured by H2 chemisorption. It is not only ascribed to the channel confinement of S-1 zeolite, but also is inseparable from the interaction between the [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor complexes and the support. The result further confirms the embedded structure of Ni@S-1 catalysts. With respect to the Ni0.44/S-1, the size of Ni NPs prepared by the impregnation method is obviously irregular from 4 to 40 nm. The average size is about 23.4 nm and the Ni dispersion is only 4.6 %, which is significantly lower than other samples. The results indicate that the Ni species dispersed on the external surface of support S-1 may aggregate into larger Ni NPs, which may be due to the weak interaction between the Ni species and the support.
3.3. Chemical speciations of Ni species active phases in Ni@S-1 catalysts
To determine the local environments of Ni species active phases in synthetic zeolites, detail characterizations have been employed.
Fig. 3
a gives the FTIR difference spectra with CO adsorption on the samples after H2 reduction at 750 °C (derived from
Fig. S3
). Two absorption bands at 2045 and 1880 cm−1 in the Ni@S-1 catalysts are detected, which can be ascribed to the linear-adsorbed CO on the framework Niδ+ species active sites and bridging-adsorbed CO on the Ni NPs, respectively
[49]
,
[53]
. Besides, a slight increase in the intensities of bands at 2045 and 1880 cm−1 can be found, and a linear relationship is built between the A1880/A2045 and the Ni/En ratio (cf.
Fig. 3
a, inset). It is suggested that two functionalized Ni species active phases in the Ni@S-1 samples may be fabricated and controlled effectively, which benefits from the tailored Ni precursor complexes. However, the intensities of two bands in the Ni0.44/S-1 become stronger obviously, accompanied with the appearance of a broad band at 2004 cm−1, which might be attributable to the uneven Ni NPs distributions located on the outer surface of S-1, which is consistent with the TEM observation.

To further confirm the above fact, the chemical speciations of Ni species active phases in the calcined catalysts are analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in
Fig. 3
b, none of absorption bands can be observed in the S-1. After the introduction of Ni species, an obvious band appears at 229 nm, which belongs to the charge transfer of O2− → Ni2+, corresponding to the tetrahedral Niδ+ species
[49]
. Besides that, three characteristic bands at 402, 650 and 740 nm ascribed to octahedral Niδ+ species are also observed. The strong bands at 402 and 740 nm are assigned to the spin-allowed electron transfer transitions 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(P) and 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F), respectively. The band at 650 nm is associated with the spin-allowed transitions in octahedral Niδ+ species
[54]
,
[55]
. It implies the types of functionalized Ni species precursors after the calcination. For the Ni0.44/S-1, the band at about 310 nm belonged to the O2− (2p) → Ni2+ (3d) charge transfer of octahedral Niδ+ in the NiO clusters appears
[56]
, indicating that large NiO species are formed on the sample, which is consistent with the TEM observation.
The existence form of Ni species is further analyzed by hydroxyl vibration infrared spectroscopy. As shown in
Fig. 3
c, four infrared absorption bands at 3740, 3725, 3693 and 3496 cm−1 in the S-1 are observed, which can be attributed to the terminal silanols at external surface, geminal silanols in the internal cavities, vicinal silanols in the internal pores, and silanol nest interacted by H-bonding, respectively
[49]
,
[57]
. Compared with the S-1, a new band at 3625 cm−1 is observed in the Ni@S-1 samples, and the corresponding intensity increases with the Ni/En ratio (cf.
Fig. 3
c and S4), which can be assigned to the hydroxylated Ni species
[41]
,
[44]
,
[58]
,
[59]
. Meanwhile, almost no changes in the infrared absorption bands at 3740, 3725 and 3693 cm−1 are found, meaning that the interaction between three Si-OH groups and Ni species is not outstanding. However, the intensity of band at 3496 cm−1 is strengthened significantly, which may be the interaction between Ni species and free Si(OH)4 groups during in situ synthesis, forming the hydroxylated Ni species that occupy the position of partial Si-OH groups, and further inducing the more silanol nests. Besides, the hydroxylated Ni species might be present in zeolitic channels and perform an interaction with silanol nests. To verify the idea, the hydroxyl vibration infrared spectra of reduced Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst are performed in
Figs. S4 and S5
. The band at 3625 cm−1 in the sample disappears completely after H2 reduction at 750 °C, accompanied with a significant decline in the intensity of band at 3496 cm−1, indicating that the silanol nests decrease accordingly due to the reduction of octahedral hydroxylated Ni species, which is in line with the above conjecture. With regard to the Ni0.44/S-1 sample, the intensities of all the bands associated with the Si-OH groups are weakened observably, mainly due to the occupation of large Ni clusters on the surface of the S-1.
To clarify the interaction between Ni species and support, Raman spectra of all the catalyst samples are shown in
Fig. 3
d. Four absorption bands at 296, 378, 451 and 808 cm−1 are detected, which belong to Si-O-Si structures in the MFI framework
[49]
,
[60]
,
[61]
. It is worth noting that the intensities of bands decrease with the increasing of Ni/En ratio. It may be because the formation of Ni clusters in the zeolitic channels partially attenuates the Si-O-Si signals of MFI channels. The phenomenon also has been proved by Li et al.
[62]
. Meanwhile, similar intensities of the bands belonged to the topological structure of MFI zeolite in the Ni0.18@S-1 and Ni0.44@S-1 can be found. This proves that the formed Ni clusters are embedded in the zeolitic channels. This phenomenon also can be seen in the Ni0.04@S-1 and Ni0.09@S-1 samples. Additionally, two new absorption bands at 610 and 702 cm−1 appear due to the formation of Ni-O-Si structures
[49]
, while the signals are also masked due to the presence of Ni clusters in the zeolitic channels at high Ni loadings. For the Ni0.44/S-1 sample, the signal bands of this structure cannot be observed due to large Ni clusters distributed on the outer surface. It confirms the differentiation of Ni species in the two catalysts. Noteworthily, the octahedral hydroxylated Ni species ought to be embedded into the S-1 zeolite by the Ni-O-Si structure, which can well stabilize the Ni NPs to inhibit the sintering.
To sum up, two functionalized Ni species active phases in the Ni@S-1 catalysts are fabricated, namely highly dispersed Ni NPs with 3–5 nm and uncertain Niδ+ species anchored in the zeolite. To further clarify the above connotation, the skeletal vibration FTIR spectra are shown in
Figure S6
. The characteristic vibrational bands at 1000–1100 cm−1 are associated with the five- and six-membered ring of Si-O-Si in MFI structure. For the S-1 and Ni0.44/S-1, a skeletal vibration band at 1063 cm−1 associated with the Si-O-Si structure is found, possibly meaning that the Ni species are weakly interacted with surface of S-1 zeolite. After the introduction of Ni species during in situ synthesis, the above band shifts to high frequency (1106 cm−1) in all the Ni@S-1 samples, further confirming the formation of Ni-O-Si structure
[43]
. It is worth noting that a new vibration band appears at 670 cm−1, belonging to the δOH vibration of phyllosilicate structure
[58]
,
[59]
,
[63]
. Meanwhile, the band at 960 cm−1 belonged to the Si-OH group is degraded, indicating that the Niδ+ species in the zeolitic framework react with the Si-OH on the zeolite to form Ni phyllosilicate. Furthermore, the hydroxylated Ni species detected by hydroxyl vibration infrared spectroscopy represent this Ni phyllosilicate species (cf.
Fig. 3
c). Both the Ni-O-Si skeletal vibration band at 1106 cm−1 and the δOH vibration band of silicate at 670 cm−1 are not reflected in Ni0.44/S-1, suggesting that the Ni phyllosilicate might not be formed on the Ni0.44/S-1 by initial wet impregnation method, rather than the larger Ni cluster.
XPS technique is employed to further prove the chemical speciations and evolution of hydroxylated Ni phyllosilicate (HNP). For the calcined samples, three signal peaks at 854.5, 856.2 and 858.4 eV attributed to NiO in the Ni0.44/S-1 sample can be observed (cf.
Fig. 4
a and
Table S1
). While, only two signal peaks at 856.7 and 858.8 eV in the Ni@S-1 samples can be found, which ought to be attributed to 1:1 hydroxylated Ni phyllosilicate (HNP-1) and 2:1 hydroxylated Ni phyllosilicate (HNP-2), respectively
[20]
,
[41]
,
[44]
,
[64]
,
[65]
. Besides, it also has been reported that the binding energy difference (ΔNi-Si) between Ni2p and Si2p can be used as another indicator to verify the formation of HNP
[66]
. It can be seen from
Table 2
that the ΔNi-Si values in the Ni@S-1 samples are between 752.9 eV and 753.1 eV, confirming the formation of HNP-1. Similarly, the ΔNi-Si values in the Ni@S-1 samples are between 755.1 eV and 755.3 eV, confirming the formation of HNP-2. Besides, the O 1 s signal peaks of the catalysts can indirectly prove the existence of nickel silicate (cf.
Fig. S7
). Two O1s signal peaks at 532.5 and 533.4 eV are observed, which can be assigned to O in the S-1 and O in the HNP, respectively
[44]
,
[67]
,
[68]
. After the samples reduced by H2, a signal peak belonged to NP-1 is observed (cf.
Fig. 4
b), simultaneously accompanied with the appearance of a new signal peak at 853.2 eV belonged to the Ni0, showing that the HNP-1 are easier to be reduced to Ni NPs and NP-1 species. While, the intensity of signal peak corresponding to NP-2 does not change basically, or even increases to some extent. Besides, the signal peak slightly shifts to a higher binding energy. It may be because the Ni species coordinated by HNP-2 mainly exists in the form of [Si-O-Ni] stable polymerization structures and only the hydroxyls might be reduced to form the oxygen vacancies. Partial [Si-O-Ni] structure is generated during the reduction process of HNP-1 and polymerizes with it, which also can be proved by a linear relationship between the α(Ni0)/α(NP-2) and the A1880/A2045 derived from CO-FTIR (cf.
Fig. S8
). Meanwhile, XPS results also prove that a strong interaction is formed between the NP-2 and the support. For the Ni0.44/S-1, it can be seen from the relative ratio of various Ni species that the formation of Ni0 NPs mainly comes from NiO on the surface of support. The intensities of other signal peaks also decrease significantly, indicating that it is difficult to form a strong interaction with the support.

The reduction abilities of Ni species in the catalysts are further studied by H2-TPR, as shown in
Fig. 4
c. The reduction peaks of Ni@S-1 samples are concentrated between 600 and 750 °C, corresponding to the reduction of strongly bonded Ni species in the phyllosilicate lattice. The high reduction temperatures prove that there is a strong interaction between Ni species and support. The reduction peaks are mainly associated with the HNP species
[20]
,
[43]
,
[44]
,
[63]
,
[69]
,
[70]
. It is reported that the peak concentrated at about 635 °C can be attributed to HNP-1, and the peak concentrated at about 700 °C can be attributed to HNP-2. Thus, the HNP-1 is easier to be reduced than the HNP-2, resulting in the formation of small-sized Ni NPs and Ni phyllosilicate intermediates in the zeolitic micropores (cf.
Fig. 4
d), which is consistent with TEM and XPS results. For the Ni0.44/S-1, the low reduction temperature proves that it is difficult to establish a strong interaction between Ni species and support by impregnation method. The peak at 328 °C represents the reduction of large NiO crystals on the outer surface, and the peak at 355 °C represents the reduction of NiO with a weak interaction. Additionally, a small reduction peak at 430 °C also appears. This may be because the Ni2+ cations are grafted to the silanols on the surface of the S-1 to form a moderate interaction, causing a high reduction temperature. The reduction abilities of Ni species also can explain why a weak signal peak of Ni2+ still can be found after the reduction of Ni0.44/S-1 catalyst.
According to the above results, the formation of Ni phyllosilicate species is confirmed, which is related to the [Si-O-Ni] structure. Therefore, the acidity of catalysts should be considered. In situ FTIR spectra with pyridine adsorption of the samples after calcination are shown in
Fig. 5
. At 150 °C, only the band at 1446 cm−1 can be observed on the S-1 sample, representing the hydrogen-bonded pyridine generated by the interaction between Si-OH group and pyridine
[49]
,
[57]
. With the introduction of Ni species, a new band at 1452 cm−1 can be detected, which belongs to the stretching vibration of pyridine ring coordinated with the Lewis acid sites
[49]
. The acid amounts are calculated according to the formula reported by Emeis
[71]
, and the results are shown in
Table 3
. The total acid amount of all the Ni@S-1 samples increase slightly with the increase of Ni loadings: Ni0.04@S-1 (7.35 μmol·g−1) < Ni0.09@S-1 (9.28 μmol·g−1) < Ni0.18@S-1 (11.31 μmol·g−1) < Ni0.44@S-1 (14.09 μmol·g−1). Even if the Ni loading increases from 0.5 % to 5 %, the actual total acid amount does not increase much, suggesting that only the HNP-2 may act as the Lewis acid sites, rather than the HNP-1. In this case, it is also conducted the pyridine infrared test on the reduced Ni0.44@S-1, and the results are shown in
Fig. S9
and
Table S2
. The results show that the acid amount of reduced Ni0.44@S-1 does not change before and after H2 reduction. Besides, XPS characterization also confirms the above hypothesis. According to the results of Py-FTIR, XPS and H2-TPR, only the NP-2 in the reduced Ni@S-1 catalysts can act as the Lewis acid sites, performing a strong interaction with the support (cf.
Fig. 4
d). The HNP-1 does not adsorb pyridine, while it can be easily reduced to Ni NPs at H2 atmosphere. Meanwhile, no adsorption band at 1540 cm−1 associated with Brønsted acid sites can be found for all tested catalysts. When the desorption temperature reaches at 400 °C, the band at 1446 cm−1 in the S-1 disappears completely, indicating that the acidity of Si-OH group is relatively weak. Meanwhile, the intensity of band at 1452 cm−1 is slightly weakened, suggesting that the NP-2 species perform an outstanding stability. It is worth noting that total acid amount is only 5.08 μmol·g−1 in the Ni0.44/S-1, indicating that most of Ni species exist on the surface in the form of NiO particles that can be easier reduced to the Ni NPs.

3.4. Catalytic performance
According to the above results, the metal–acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 catalysts that consist of highly dispersed Ni NPs with 3–5 nm and the NP-2 intermediates are successfully constructed in the S-1 zeolite by regulating the coordination environments of Ni precursors. The Ni NPs active phases ought to be conducive to the activation of CH4 molecules. The NP-2 species as the Lewis acid sites might be beneficial for the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules. To achieve a delicate equilibrium relationship between the CH4 activation and the CO2 consumption, the relative proportions of two functionalized Ni species active phases in catalysts are calculated (cf.
Table 2
). The corresponding DRM behaviors are explored in detail.
As shown in
Fig. 6
, catalytic performance of all the catalysts for the DRM reaction are conducted under the reaction conditions of 750 °C and WHSV = 100 L·gcat−1·h−1. Noteworthily, high CH4 conversion of 85.1 % and CO2 conversion of 88.7 % over the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst can be achieved (cf.
Fig. S10
), which are close to the thermodynamic equilibrium (black dash lines). After reaction 100 h, very low deactivation rates (CH4: 0.0008 h−1 and CO2: 0.0010 h−1) can be found, which are superior to the reported literatures (cf. Tables 4 and S3), and the H2/CO ratio basically keeps at about 1 in the whole reaction process, meaning that the formation and consumption of “process carbon” species almost reach a near-equilibrium. Such a catalytic equilibrium significantly improves the stability of catalyst. While, it still suffers from a slight deactivation phenomenon. It might be because the CO2 conversion is slightly higher than that of CH4, rather than the Ni sintering (cf.
Fig. S11
a). By contrast, other Ni@S-1 catalysts with different ratios of α(Ni0)/α(NP-2) show an obvious slow deactivation. Initial CO2 conversion (69.6 %) over the Ni0.04@S-1 is much higher than that of CH4 (59.5 %), and the ratio of H2/CO is only about 0.8. After 50 h, the CO2 and CH4 deactivation rates reach 0.0108 and 0.0062 h−1, respectively. This may be associated with the active sites of CH4 activation are much less than those of CO2 consumption [α(Ni0)/α(NP-2) = 0.3]. At this time, the “process carbon” generated after CH4 activation might not meet the CO2 consumption, or excessive precursors caused by CO2 adsorbed at the active sites might lead to the occurrence of competitive adsorption/activation with CH4 molecules. When the ratio of α(Ni0)/α(NP-2) is close to 0.8, the deactivation rate of CH4 is slightly higher than that of CO2 (0.0080 h−1 vs 0.0078 h−1). The phenomenon is also reflected on the Ni0.18@S-1. It might be suggested that excess “process carbon” are generated by CH4 decomposed over the Ni NPs and cannot be timely consumed by CO2. At this time, carbon deposition might cover the active sites on the catalyst, resulting in the deactivation. To sum up, a bifunctional zeolite catalyst with an appropriate proportion [α(Ni0)/α(NP-2) = 2.0] can perform an excellent activity and carbon resistance in DRM reaction.

(a) CH4 conversion; (b) CO2 conversion; (c) H2/CO molar ratio; (d) CH4 and CO2 deactivation rates. Reaction conditions: 50 mg of catalyst, WHSV = 100 L·gcat−1·h−1, CH4: CO2: N2 = 1: 1: 1, 750 °C, pressure = 1 atm. The black dash lines represent the equilibrium conversions of CH4 and CO2 at 750 °C calculated by HSC Chemistry 6.0 soft.
For the Ni0.44/S-1, CH4 and CO2 can maintain high conversions at the beginning of the reaction due to the existence of larger Ni NPs. To some extent, it is beneficial to eliminate the carbon deposition generated by excessive activated CH4 molecules at a high reaction temperature. Thus, the catalyst maintains a low deactivation rate in 50 h (cf.
Fig. 6
d). However, as the reaction proceeds, excessive carbon deposition will not be consumed in time, and then attach to the active sites of catalyst, resulting in the rapid deactivation after 50 h. Meanwhile, too high temperature will also make the sintering of Ni NPs due to the weak interaction between the active phase and the support. It can be seen from the TEM after reaction that the Ni NPs aggregate into larger clusters and migrate outside the support during the reaction (cf.
Fig. S11
b), resulting in irreversible deactivation. Therefore, the deactivation rate of Ni0.44/S-1 (CH4: 0.0062 h−1 and CO2: 0.0072 h−1) is apparently higher than that of Ni0.44@S-1.
To further prove the carbon resistance of above two catalysts, the stability tests at 650 °C are carried out (cf.
Fig. S12
). The conversions of CH4 and CO2 over the Ni0.44@S-1 keep very stable in 50 h, further indicating that the catalyst exhibits an excellent carbon resistance. However, the Ni0.44/S-1 catalyst is deactivated from the beginning and the deactivation rate is very fast (CH4: 0.0185 h−1 and CO2: 0.0139 h−1). This may be because the catalyst cannot consume excessive “process carbon” during the reaction at a lower temperature, resulting in a large number of coke deposition. This also proves that unsuited Ni species active phases cannot meet the improvement in the carbon resistance of catalyst. Therefore, constructing bifunctional Ni species with different coordination forms to induce synergistic catalysis is an important strategy to achieve high activity and stability of DRM reaction at lower temperatures.
Due to the excellent carbon resistance of Ni0.44@S-1, additional kinetic tests are carried out (cf.
Fig. S13
) according to preliminary experiments and mathematical calculations, proving that internal and external diffusion factors can be eliminated under this condition. In addition, the apparent activation energies (Eapp) of all the samples in the DRM reaction are calculated by fitting Arrhenius plot based on the low conversions of CH4 and CO2 (less than 15 %). The results are shown in
Fig. 7
and
Table 4
. The apparent activation energies of all the catalysts for the CH4 activation are as follows: Ni0.04@S-1 (129.6 kJ/mol) > Ni0.09@S-1 (127.4 kJ/mol) > Ni0.18@S-1 (101.5 kJ/mol) > Ni0.44@S-1 (74.1 kJ/mol), and the apparent activation energies for the CO2 activation are as follows: Ni0.04@S-1 (109.2 kJ/mol) > Ni0.09@S-1 (100.8 kJ/mol) > Ni0.18@S-1 (75.7 kJ/mol) > Ni0.44@S-1 (61.1 kJ/mol). Noteworthily, the apparent activation energies of CH4 on the samples are higher than those of CO2, indicating that the activation of CH4 is a rate-determining step. Thus, more Ni NPs active phases are needed to be activated to meet the CO2 consumption. As shown in
Table 4
, the difference values in the activation energies between CH4 and CO2 over the Ni0.04@S-1, Ni0.09@S-1 and Ni0.18@S-1 catalysts keep at above 20 kJ/mol, but the value over the Ni0.44@S-1 is only about 13.0 kJ/mol. The results indicate that the activations of CH4 and CO2 molecules need to be built on the appropriate synergistic active phases, which can explain high stabilities of Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst. For the Ni0.44/S-1, both the apparent activation energies of CH4 and CO2 are higher than that of Ni0.44@S-1 (cf.
Fig. S14
). The result further shows the significance in the construction of bifunctional Ni species active phases in the DRM reaction performance.

In addition, the TOF value based on CH4 conversion over the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst is also much higher than the reported values (i.e., 0.07–2.1 s−1) over the Ni-based catalysts using the siliceous supports (cf.
Table S3
).
3.5. Analysis of catalyst deactivation: Sintering and carbon deposition
As mentioned above, metal sintering and carbon deposition are generally considered to be the main reasons for the deactivation of Ni-based catalysts in DRM reaction.
Fig. S11
a shows the TEM images of spent catalysts. The results show that the average size of Ni NPs in the Ni0.44@S-1 after reaction 100 h at 750 °C still remains at about 6.1 nm, indicating that the catalyst performs an anti-sintering ability at high temperatures. Due to the physical limitation of the zeolitic channel, the interaction between the Ni NPs and the zeolite is enhanced, so that it is not easy to agglomerate at high temperatures. Moreover, only a small amount of carbon species can be found at the interval between the zeolite surface and the zeolite crystallite, which also proves that the catalyst also exhibits a good carbon resistance. For the spent Ni0.44/S-1, it can see from
Fig. S11
b that the catalyst appears a serious sintering phenomenon after reaction 100 h at 750 °C. Ni NPs aggregate into larger clusters and migrate out of the support, wrapped by a large amount of carbon deposition, indicating that the deactivation of catalyst is not only related to the sintering of Ni active phases, but also is associated with the carbon deposition.
Fig. 8
a and 8b further provide TG and DTG curves of spent catalysts after reaction at 750 °C to measure coke content. It is noteworthy that the weight loss of Ni0.04@S-1 is only 0.5 %, indicating that the catalysts with bifunctional Ni species active phases also have excellent coke resistance. However, the catalyst still shows an obvious deactivation, which ought to be ascribed to the excessive CO2 adsorption by active sites on the catalyst and the competitive adsorption/activation of CH4 molecules. The weight loss of Ni0.44@S-1 is relatively obvious (ca. 7.4 %), but these carbon deposits may be “process carbon” species that have not been consumed during the reaction and remain on the surface of the catalyst due to the termination of reaction. It can be seen from the DTG curve that the weight loss temperature (ca. 605 °C) of Ni0.44@S-1 is obvious lower than that of Ni0.44/S-1 (ca. 674 °C), indicating that more “process carbon” on the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst may be the amorphous carbon species. Relatively speaking, the weight loss of Ni0.44/S-1 is more obvious (ca. 9.5 %), indicating that the carbon deposition on the catalyst is most serious, leading to the decrease of catalytic activity. Photographs of the catalysts before and after the reaction are compared (cf.
Fig. S15
). Ni0.04@S-1 and Ni0.44@S-1 catalysts become gray after the reaction, which may represent the color of Ni0. While, the Ni0.44/S-1 catalyst is blackened completely, which is related to the formation of coke on the surface of catalyst.

Fig. 8. TG (a) and DTG curves (b), and Raman spectra (c) of spent catalysts.
The types of carbon species on the surface of catalysts after reaction are characterized by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in
Fig. 8
c, two signal peaks on the catalysts after reaction are observed, which can be related to the D and G bands, respectively. Among them, the G band at 1595 cm−1 is considered to be the graphitized carbon species
[14]
,
[29]
,
[72]
,
[73]
,
[74]
. The D band at 1348 cm−1 represents a disordered and defective carbon structure (i.e., amorphous carbon). The area ratio of G band to D band (IG/ID) can be used as an indicator of the graphitization degree of carbon species, that is, the higher the value of IG/ID is, the higher the graphitization degree of carbon deposition is. Therefore, the graphitization degree (IG/ID = 1.23) of carbon deposition on the Ni0.44/S-1 catalyst is significantly higher than that on the Ni0.44@S-1 (IG/ID = 0.80) catalyst, which is in line with the TEM images (cf.
Fig. S11
). The low IG/ID value of Ni0.44@S-1 indicates that more carbon species on the catalyst are disordered and defective, meaning that the “process carbon” species on the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst ought to be easier consumed, which is consistent with the TG-DTG results.
3.6. Possible CO2-CH4 reforming reaction mechanism
To sum up, the equilibrium between the formation and consumption of “process carbon” species in the Ni@S-1 zeolites is a crucial step to achieve efficient CO2-CH4 reforming. It is generally accepted that CO2 can be regarded as the Lewis basic due to the lone pairs of electrons on the O atom in the molecule. Thus, the basic sites (or Lewis acid sites) on the catalyst play a crucial role in adsorption and activation of CO2, which might decrease the tendencies of coke deposition. In this regard, CO2-TPD is considered as a useful method in identifying the nature of such sites on a catalyst surface.
Fig. 9
a shows two distinguishable CO2 desorption peaks in the reduced samples. The low desorption peak temperature appeared at around 110 °C corresponds to ‘weakly basic sites’, which ought to be associated with the bicarbonate formed on the Ni-O-Si species
[75]
. Another desorption peak temperature appeared at around 346 °C corresponds to ‘moderately basic sites’, which arises from the monodentate carbonates species formed on the Lewis acid sites with oxygen vacancy in the NP-2 intermediates (cf.
Fig. 4
d). Through previous studies
[76]
,
[77]
, increasing moderate-intensity basic sites allow for the adsorption and activation of CO2 easier. The resulting carbonate species enables easier react with coke precursors (e.g., CHx species). It can be seen that two basic sites are observably increased on the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst. Meanwhile, the two desorption temperatures shift from 121 to 104 °C, and from 346 to 308 °C with the increasing of Ni/En ratio, respectively. Besides, a linear correlativity between the Lewis acid sites and CO2 consumption area (regarding to the moderately basic sites) in the Ni@S-1 can be observed (cf.
Fig. 9
b). The above results indicate that more moderate-strength basic sites on the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst can cause less carbon deposits by reacting with coke precursors, and consequently lead to highly stability during the DRM reaction. For the Ni0.44/S-1, although the two desorption peaks appear at low temperatures of 97 and 255 °C, the amount of two basic sites are very low, which cannot meet the consumption of coke precursors from the decomposition of CH4, which is in line with the above results.

To further get the mechanistic information about the DRM reaction on the Ni@S-1 catalyst, in situ FTIR measurements are conducted to monitor the intermediates formed by CH4 and/or CO2 adsorption.
Fig. 10
gives the results of temperature programmed reaction (from 50 to 700 °C) of CH4 and CO2 on the reduced Ni0.44@S-1 catalysts. At 50 °C (cf.
Fig. 10
, black line), the IR band at 1544 cm−1 is the characteristic of monodentate carbonates
[78]
, and the bands at 1357 and 1306 cm−1 correspond to the deformation vibrations of adsorbed CHx* species and gaseous CH4, respectively
[79]
,
[80]
. With an increase in the system temperature, the intensity of CHx* species increases slowly due to the decomposition of CH4. When the system temperature is up to 200 °C (cf.
Fig. 10
, green line), the IR bands appeared at 1945 and 1841, and 1747 cm−1 are belonged to the bridge adsorbed CO* and formyl (–HCO*) species, respectively
[78]
,
[81]
. At the same time, a slight increase in the intensity of the IR bands arises at 3627/3599 cm−1 and 3738/3704 cm−1 is corresponded to the active OH* groups on the surface
[79]
,
[82]
, which might be formed by the reaction of H* species with carbonates (CO2*+H*→CO*+OH*). With continuously raising the system temperature, two new IR bands at 1690 and 1586 cm−1 are attributed to formate (–HCO2*) species and increase gradually
[79]
,
[80]
,
[83]
. Meanwhile, the bridge adsorbed CO* and formyl species also increase, while the CHx* species (1363 cm−1) and the OH* groups (3627/3599 and 3738/3704 cm−1) decline. The results demonstrate that the surface carbonates are converted to adsorbed CO*, formyl and formate species assisted by the spilled H*. After the depletion of CHx* species, the intensity of OH* groups increases slowly, and the CO*, formyl and formate species do not change significantly, meaning that the adsorption/activation of CH4 and CO2 can reach a dynamic equilibrium. Noteworthily, the intensity of band at 1747 cm−1 over the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst is slightly stronger than that of band at 1586 cm−1, meaning that the formyl species are easier formed. While, the opposite happens with the Ni0.04@S-1 catalyst (cf.
Fig. S16
), meaning that more CO2 molecules over the active sites are formed in the form of formates. The phenomenon can further explain the deactivation reason of Ni0.04@S-1 catalyst.

, a possible CO2-CH4 reforming mechanism on the bifunctional Ni species active phases of Ni@S-1 catalyst might occur as described in
Scheme 2
. The DRM reaction proceeds adsorption and activation of CH4 and CO2 over the metal–acid sites of Ni@S-1 catalysts via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. CH4 can be dissociated and adsorbed as CHx* and H* species on the Ni NPs. Meanwhile, CO2 can be activated on the NP-2 intermediates to form carbonates, and then be dissociated to formyl, formate, CO*, O* and OH* under the induction of H* species. Subsequently, the OH* can assist CHx* species convert into CO* and H*. Meanwhile, the O* can react with COx* to CO*. The new reaction pathways might reveal the essence in the catalytic stability of Ni@S-1 catalysts and imply the significance of bifunctional Ni species active phases, which can cooperatively boost the CO2-CH4 reforming at lower temperatures.

4. Conclusions
As a summary, Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with smaller size (3–5 nm) embedded Ni phyllosilicate as a metal–acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is designed and successfully prepared by controlling the coordination states of Ni precursor complexes in the present work. The Ni NPs physically confined in the micropores of S-1 zeolite performs superior sintering resistance and the outstanding ability to activate CH4 molecules (forming CHx* species). Meanwhile, the 2:1 hydroxylated Ni phyllosilicate species anchored in the zeolitic framework after undergoing H2 reduction are more conducive to the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules. Due to the synergy of two Ni species active phases, the Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst exhibits highly approximate CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1.0) and excellent stability under 750 °C for 100 h with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat−1·h−1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation. Even if the DRM reaction is at a lower temperature of 650 °C, the catalyst still performs high catalytic activity, stability, anti-sintering and carbon resistance. In situ FTIR experiments reveals that such superior catalytic performance mainly benefits from the establishment of a benign balance between the formation and consumption of “process carbon” species during the DRM reaction. The present strategy provides a new way for the design of Ni-based catalysts with simultaneous coking- and sintering-resistant for DRM applications.
