Abstract
Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has already been implemented worldwide in industrial processes to produce value-added propylene. The discovery of earth-abundant and environmentally friendly metal with high activity in C–H cleavage is of great importance. Co species encapsulated within zeolite are highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation. However, exploring a promising Co catalyst remains a nontrivial target. Direct control of the regioselective distribution of Co species in the zeolite framework through altering their crystal morphology gives opportunities to modify the metallic Lewis acidic features, thus providing an active and appealing catalyst. Herein, we achieved the regioselective localization of highly active subnanometric CoO clusters in straight channels of siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets with controllable thickness and aspect ratio. The subnanometric CoO species were identified by different types of spectroscopies, probe measurements, and density functional theory calculations, as the coordination site for the electron-donating propane molecules. The catalyst showed promising catalytic activity for the industrially important PDH with propane conversion of 41.8% and propylene selectivity higher than 95% and was durable during 10 successive regeneration cycles. These findings highlight a green and facile method to synthesize metal-containing zeolitic materials with regioselective metal distribution and also to open up a future perspectives for designing advanced catalysts with integrated advantages of the zeolitic matrix and metal structures.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a significant organic feedstock for the manufacture of numerous valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels. (1−3) Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an “on-purpose” production process, provides a promising approach to meeting the rapidly increasing demands of propylene worldwide, reducing dependence on petroleum-based materials due to the scarcity of fossil fuels and also the increasing availability of abundant shale gas. (3) Pt-based and supported CrOx catalysts are two widely applied commercial catalytic systems in industrial PDH processes. (1,2) The high price of Pt as well as the environmental hostility of Cr6+ largely limit further development and spur the exploration of cheaper substitutes to satisfy the industrial-scale performance. Alternatively, suitable nonprecious-metal catalysts (e.g., Zn, (4−6) Fe, (7,8) Zr, (9,10) and Co (11−16)) are subsequently investigated because they exhibit excellent PDH activity. Among the reported substitutes, Co-containing catalysts have exhibited promising potential for dehydrogenation because of their catalytic capacity and environmentally friendly nature. Typically, heteroatomic zeolites have enriched our previous understanding of supported catalysts and exhibited improved performances. (4,6,8,11,39) However, it is still a quite nontrivial target for a Co-based catalyst to optimize its redox activity.
Lewis acidic sites are reported as active sites for PDH reaction due to their deep affinity with the electronegative intermediates, which originate from the initial heterolytic C–H bond dissociation. (1,6,17) Constructing coordinatively unsaturated sites has been proposed as a hopeful strategy to modify the acidic properties; approaches such as downsizing metallic particles to the atomic-level range and adopting strong metal–support interactions are mostly presented. (4,5,7−12,15) Besides, the channel geometry of zeolite crystals is another parameter influencing the electronic and geometric structures of confined metal species due to the multidimensional interactions between metal entities and the porous matrix, and the acidic features can be modulated by varying the binding sites with the framework. (11,18−20) Herein, we propose that differences in the location of subnanometric CoO at various channel systems could yield biased Lewis acidic features, and the PDH performance could be modulated by selectively enriching or reducing the CoO location in a particular type of channel or pores. It is also established that the siting of subnanometric metal entities within the MFI topology is responsible for the site accessibility, (18) diffusion behavior, (21) and transition-state confinement in numerous reactions, (16,22) as reflected in their reactivity.
The distinctions of channel systems have a profound effect on the interaction between the metal entities and zeolitic framework. The active metal entities within the zeolite-confined environment can be designed rationally, which requires geometric matching guided by structure-directing agents and other synthesis variables. (18,20,23−25) Furthermore, benefiting from innovations in zeolite crystal morphology design, new opportunities to adjust the regioselective distribution of the subnanometric metal species emerge. (20,26−28,32−34) Silicalite-1 zeolite (MFI topology), as the most widely used industrially relevant zeolite, contains straight channels (5.3 × 5.6 Å) running along the b axis and tortuous sinusoidal (5.1 × 5.5 Å) channels along the a axis. (29,30) Decreasing the zeolitic domain size preferentially along the b axis can increase the exposure of straight channels, which could modulate the distribution of introduced components directionally. Yu and co-workers achieved RhxRu1–x bimetallic clusters regioselectively confined in the sinusoidal five-numbered rings of a self-pillared MFI-type zeolite. (26) Corma et al. allowed Pt entities to be inserted into internal channels between layered siliceous MWW through interzeolite transformation. (27) Xie et al. reported that the oriented distribution of components in platelike ZSM-5 catalysts modulated the transfer of the C1 intermediates. (28,34) Therefore, adjusting the spatial distribution of the active metal entities, denoted as Lewis acid sites in the zeolitic matrix, may relate to a reasonable balance of the active centers, which will provide a better catalytic performance.
Herein, we coupled the in situ organometallic complex protection strategy and morphology modification to achieve a regioselective localization of subnanometric CoO clusters of the siliceous MFI nanosheets with modulable thickness. The subnanometric CoO species were identified by different types of spectroscopies, probe measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as the coordination site for the electron-donating propane molecules, which highlights the influence of the channel microenvironment on the coordination and acidic properties of Co species. Our approach is simplified by avoiding the use of expensive porogens and the ion-exchange process. The insights attained not only help to clarify the correlation between CoO siting with its PDH catalytic performance but also aid in the optimization for engineering the regioselective distribution of metal on the design of heterogeneous catalysts.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Control of the Thickness of Nanosheets: Adjustment of the Amount of Urea
Herein, Scheme 1 describes the general route for the synthesis of Co@MFI with tailored morphology. Urea, serving as the modifier, was introduced to the synthesis solution before static hydrothermal crystallization. (31−34) Co protected by chelating ligands enforced its encapsulation into the crystallizing frameworks. (6,23) We explored the influence of the urea dosage on zeolite morphology by using the system 0.4:1.0:35:y tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)/silicon dioxide (SiO2)/water (H2O)/urea, where y was varied between 0 and 0.8. The microscopic images (Figure 1a–e) present a well-defined nanosheet-like structure with uniform size and even dispersion. This confirms the successful synthesis of MFI nanosheets with average thicknesses of 90, 58, 70, and 87 nm, respectively (Figure 1f–j). The aspect ratios of the c to a axis (Lc/La) and the c to b axis (Lc/Lb) are used to describe the morphological characteristics of the [100] and [010] faces, (29,30) on which the pore mouths of the sinusoidal channel (5.1 Å × 5.5 Å) and straight channel (5.3 Å × 5.6 Å) appear superficially. (20,21) A decrease from ∼0.9 to ∼0.08 of the Lc/La ratio can be observed, and the value of Lc/Lb achieves a maximum when y = 0.4 (Figure 1k,l). The dimensions along the c axis remain in the range of 190–210 nm and are not influenced too much by the modifier concentration, which means an increase in the aspect ratio represents a decrease in the thickness. In other words, these results approve that the modifiers selectively influence the anisotropic growth rates of different planes during crystallization. This is in line with a previous conception that modifiers absorbed on the crystal plane could hinder the attachment of subsequent growth units. (31,35) The best result regarding the Lc/Lb aspect ratio was obtained with y = 0.4 (Figure 1c). Compared to the conventional crystal size of 213 × 131 × 196 nm in the absence of urea (Figure 1a), it has a much higher aspect ratio (3.6 vs 1.5) and a thinner thickness (58 vs 131 nm). Summarizing the series of above results, we can propose that the presence of urea markedly inhibits growth along the b axis but facilitates the oriented generation of the ac crystal face, which presents the MFI nanosheet-like structure with a higher aspect ratio and a thinner thickness.

(l) Aspect ratios of the c to a axis and the c to b axis with various dosages of urea. (m) XRD patterns of Co@MFI synthesized with various dosages of urea.
The substantial growth of zeolite was also inspected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Tiny nanometric particles with oval shapes appear in the gel system after 1 h of hydrothermal treatment at 170 °C (Figure S1a). These small colloidal species succeed in agglomerating into individual nanoparticles by consuming nutrients around them (Figure S1b). With prolongation of the crystallization time, more particles appear and evolve into nanosheets with unique appearance features (Figure S1c–e). In the light of the collected results, our interpretation of the preferential growth of a well-developed morphplogy is that the urea would adsorb on the [010] surface. The silicate nutrients, Co species, and TPA+, which are distributed along the ac plane, started to be consumed preferably along their perpendicular orientations.
The Cs-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and high-resolution TEM images of the thinnest sample ( denoted as Co@MFI-P50) also verify that the sheetlike structure is well preserved after Co introduction (Figure 2), and the corresponding STEM–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental mapping results indicate that the Co entities are uniformly dispersed within the MFI-type zeolitic matrix (Figure 2g–j). Inevitably, we also found areas showing intensity profiles similar to those of the aggregated clusters. The crystallographic directions are indicated (Figure 2d–f), given preliminary proof of the spatial information of the Co entities encapsulated with zeolite crystals. By observation of the representative zeolite crystallite along with the [010] projection and also the tilted [010] orientation, the brighter spots suggest that a few of the straight channels are filled by Co species, and the mean size of the Co entities was measured to be about 0.88 nm with a subnanometric scale. Nevertheless, a more detailed identification of the sites of encapsulated Co entities needs further characterization supported by advanced techniques.

We prepared two Co-containing silicalite-1 zeolite nanosheets with average thicknesses of 50 and 90 nm (denoted as Co@MFI-P50 and Co@MFI-P90, respectively) and a conventional nanocrystal (denoted as Co@MFI-B130) and investigated the catalytic function of reduced crystal thickness. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all catalysts exhibit distinctive characteristic peaks of the MFI structure and high crystallinity (Figure S2a). (15,29) Morphology modification and Co introduction do not change the intrinsic crystalline phase, and no impurity or Co3O4 polymorphs are observed for the Co-containing samples. The N2 adsorption–desorption curves reveal that the intrinsic microporosity of the MFI crystals is well preserved (Figure S2b). The slight increase in the pore volume of thinner samples results from the creation of voids or cavities contributed by the stacking between nanosheets (Table S1). (30)
2.2. Catalytic Performance of Co@MFI with Controlled Thickness
With the prepared samples, the PDH catalytic performance was investigated in a 10 h test (Figure 3a). Notably, Co@MFI-P50 exhibits promising activity with a propane conversion of 41.8% and a remarkably enhanced initial propylene formation rate [r(C3H6)] of 12.5 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1 and reaches a maximum of ∼15 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1 under demanding conditions [600 °C, propane weight hourly space velocity (propane WHSV) of 7.5 h–1]. The conventional nanosized Co@MFI-B130 sample shows a lower propane conversion (5 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1) and a lower selectivity (∼90%). The excellent specific activities were further confirmed by evaluating the initial overall turnover frequency (TOF) per Co at 600 °C based on all of the Co atoms (Figure 3b). The TOF value of the Co@MFI-P50 catalyst attains 31.0 h–1, which is several times higher than those of the Co@MFI-P90 (23.9 h–1) and Co@MFI-B130 catalysts (12.6 h–1). Furthermore, the apparent activation energies (Eaapp) for the C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction were measured as a function of the controlled thickness by fitting the reaction rate with the Arrhenius law, as shown in Figure 3c. Eaapp of Co@MFI-P50 is less negative than that of the bulk one, confirming that the propane activation process more easily happens on Co@MFI-P50. The regeneration activity of Co@MFI-P50 was examined in 10 successive PDH runs (Figure 3d). Each regeneration cycle includes PDH reactions for 6 h and coke air oxidation at 500 °C for 6 h. Co@MFI-P50 well maintains its catalytic performance over repeated cycles, with an initial r(C3H6) at the first cycle of 13.3 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1, and decreases to 10.4 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1 during the last regeneration, whereas the selectivity of propylene slightly decreases from 94% to 92%. The above results further state the promising durability and recycling stability of Co@MFI-P50 catalyst in PDH reactions.

Characterizations were also performed on the spent catalysts to determine the coke deposition. TEM profiles of the samples after the reaction (Figure S3a,b) show that the morphology of Co@MFI remains unchanged, and there are no obvious cobalt oxide or metallic Co-related diffraction peaks in the spent catalyst (Figure S3c). However, coke appears obviously over Co@MFI-B130, which is in line with the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)–differential thermal analysis (DTA) graph (Figure S4a,b). The amounts of coke follow the order of Co@MFI-P50 < Co@MFI-P90 < Co@MFI-B130. For all catalysts, double exothermic peaks can be observed, with a dominant peak above 500 °C, indicating that two kinds of coke species combust at different temperatures. The major weight loss at 500 °C is ascribed to thermally unstable carbonaceous residues generated by C–C scissors. (36) For Co@MFI-B130, the weight loss peak moves toward a higher temperature, which represents that the unstable C residues are converted into more condensed coke compounds. A quantitative investigation of the deposited coke according to the ratio of SG band/SD band was also carried out by Raman spectroscopy. The highest intensity of Co@MFI-B130 indicates an increase in thermally stable coke, which is in line with the DTA profiles, as shown in Figure S4d. Thus, we speculate that more coke species are formed, and they could not escape from the tiny channels and be transformed into more stable carbonaceous residues in bulk morphology. Moreover, for crystals with shortened thicknesses, the precursor could easily diffuse out from the shorter straight channels without further contact with the active sites, leading to a better coke tolerance capacity and an obvious advantage on the catalytic activity.
2.3. Structure Analysis of Co@MFI Zeolite Catalysts
Zeolites with varying thicknesses all provided effective confinement to obtain the formation of highly dispersed metal entities. The surface properties of siliceous supports for the creation of encapsulated Co@MFI were demonstrated further by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure 4a). Pure supports have characteristic bands at 3726 cm–1, ascribed to the isolated silanol groups (SiOH). (37) One broad absorption peak characterizing silanol nests, positioned at 3500 cm–1, can be observed, (37,38) and in the case of the nanosheet sample, a much greater peak intensity can be noted. These changes indicate that morphology modification promotes the generation of silanol nests within the crystal framework. Upon Co introduction, the intensity of the silanol nests decreases greatly with the emergence of CoOH characteristic bands at 3622 cm–1, indicating that [CoOH]+ are generated via the consumption of silanol nest species to interact with Co in both samples. (39) The spectra also reveals that the purely siliceous zeolites allow the generation of dispersed Co entities and the silanol nests group plays a crucial role in facilitating the metal introduction.

To obtain additional insight into the influence of anisotropic frameworks with different channel orientations on the local structure of introduced Co species, we investigated the reduction behavior of Co@MFI catalysts (Figure 4b). No H2 consumption was detected up to 730 °C, verifying the absence of Co3+. The distinguished peak can be attributed to the reduction of high-dispersed CoO confined within the zeolitic channels. (39,40) It can be expected that subnanometric CoO presented in a porous environment could be resistant to reduction during reductive reaction conditions. Satellites in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Co 2p with a 6 eV difference from the main peak also confirm the existence of a Co(II) oxidation state (Figure 4c). (41) Thus, we propose that the samples solely possess the Co(II) oxidation state, which is well verified by the consistency of the stoichiometric ratio in CoO and the actual H2 consumption from temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) profiles. The silicate-1 framework with MFI topology structure is evidenced by Raman spectra (centered at 372 cm–1) in Figure 4e. (40) Spectroscopy of the as-prepared catalysts reveals a broad peak positioned around 793 cm–1, which is assigned to the Co–O stretching vibration of a CoO4 tetrahedron (Co2+Td) due to the A1 symmetric stretching mode. (42) The coordination geometry is also confirmed by the spin–orbital coupling triplet peaks at 490, 566, and 650 nm in UV–vis profiles (Figure 4d), which are generally ascribed to the d–d transitions of Co2+ species in a tetrahedral geometry (Co2+Td) environment. Specifically, these characteristic bands can be interpreted with transitions from the ground state 4A2(F) to the excited state 4T1(F) and 4T1(P) levels. (15,42,44) A weak shoulder peak between 700 and 800 nm shown in the UV–vis spectra suggests that some of the Co2+ species display octahedral geometry (Co2+ Oh) in Co@MFI-B130. (43) The species is also represented by a distinguished peak around 670 cm–1 in the Raman spectra. (43) A comparison of the intensities demonstrates that CoO (Co2+Td) in the tetrahedral coordination geometry is dominantly present in Co@MFI-Px with strong interaction with silica.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) spectra in Figure 4f helps in the analysis of acid sites and the NH3 adsorption behavior in catalysts. All catalysts exhibit distinguished desorption peaks in the low-temperature range, ascribed to NH3 adsorbed on weak Lewis acid sites. (39) Intriguingly, an increase in the catalyst acidity was noticed with a decrease in thickness, and the certain acidic sites originated from the introduced Co species. Therefore, it can then be deduced that zeolite-stabilized subnanometeric CoO species act as catalytically active sites for the PDH reaction. The existing variation in the catalytic activity can be ascribed to a change in the acidity, arising from subtle but determined differences in CoO siting and distribution caused by unique morphological features of the MFI zeolite nanosheets.
The siting of CoO species refers to their position in zeolitic channels. Three characteristics accommodating introduced ions or subnanometric clusters have been identified in MFI topology, referred to as α, β, and γ sites. (15,19,44) In more detail, the α type is incorporated at the straight channels of the MFI-type zeolite, the β site is situated in the intersectional cavities, and the γ site is positioned at the sinusoidal channels. Information supported by UV–vis spectroscopy in the visible region showed that the characteristic absorption bands of the framework vibrations are caused by perturbations of the CoO species at different locations. (15,16,19,45,46) The dependence of the integral intensity of the individual Gaussian bands of Co@MFI catalysts was investigated for determination of the location of the CoO species (Figure 5a). We clarified that the α-type Co(II) in MFI is identified by the single band at 15360 cm–1. The spectra of the γ-type site are characterized by doublets at 20000 and 20800 cm–1. The β-type site is represented by a quartet, at 16900, 18000, 18900, and 21500 cm–1. The discrimination of three individual spectral components yields quantitative information on the distribution of the corresponding CoO species in all zeolites. The calculated absorption coefficients are kα = (3.7 ± 1.1) × 10–3, kβ= (2.7 ± 0.7) × 10–3, and kγ= (0.9 ± 0.6) × 10–3, respectively. (15,47) The result reveals that the concentration of γ-type Co(II) is relatively lower (∼6%) in all catalysts, while β-type Co(II) species are predominant without exception (ca. 62–75%), and Co@MFI-B130 has the highest amount of β-type Co(II) with 75.4%. Notably, Co@MFI-P50, with a superior PDH catalytic performance, has the most α-type Co(II) compared to the other two catalysts; in particular, it exhibits nearly 2 times higher concentration than Co@MFI-B130 (31.2% vs 18.4%). The quantitative description enables us to conclude that the catalytic reactivity of subnanometric CoO strongly relies on the confined environment. Such configurations denoted as the α-type, modulated by multidimensional interactions, exhibit higher acidic properties and also greater activation capacity.

This can be further confirmed by following NO-FTIR characterizations. Importantly, after NO is adsorbed at room temperature on the Co@MFI catalysts, two nitrosyl bands with peaks at 1826 and 1897 cm–1 are observed in Co@MFI-P50 (Figure 5b,c), which are generally assigned to cobalt(2+) dinitrosyls [Co2+(NO)2] displaying asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes. (19,48) Similar spectra were reported to be assigned to the Td framework Co(II) on CoAPO-18. (50) The other features (absorption peaks at 1631 and 1700 cm–1) are due to gas-phase NO2 and N2O4 and will not be further discussed. (49) NO bands referring to NO complexes coordinated with Co3+ are not observed in either sample, which should give typical bands around 1930 cm–1. (49,50) Co2+(NO)2 is the dominating adsorbed species located at 1897 cm–1 for both catalysts, but the absorption intensity in Co@MFI-B130 is much weaker, as described in the contour map (Figure 5d,e). NO is a Lewis base, and the existence of an unpaired electron provokes the adsorption of NO as dimers. (19) Namely, the acid sites, denoted as active α-CoO-type sites confined in the straight 10-membered-ring channel, are more inclined to generate dinitrosyl species. This is consistent with the previous conception that the α sites in the framework are more readily coordinate with electron-donating Lewis base molecules. (51)
2.4. Reaction Mechanism
In situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were performed to explore the dynamic evolution of Co@MFI catalysts (Figure 6a,b). A spectral band at 2967 cm–1, ascribed to gaseous propane, is detected in the initial stage at 50 °C. Notably, new strong bands at 1600 and 1690 cm–1 emerge, while the band at 1625 cm–1 disappears at elevated temperatures. Meanwhile, a methyl band at 1370 cm–1 and a methylene band at 1456 cm–1 are also detected during the heating process. (6,52) Therefore, we proposed that the reaction takes place with propane activated and involved from that moment on, and the band at 1625 cm–1 induced by the C–H vibration is connected with Co–C3H8*. These changes are even more pronounced in the contour map in Figure 6c,d. The band at 1370 cm–1 refers to the methyl group in propane, which disappears earlier than the methylene group centered at 1456 cm–1, indicating that the dehydrogenation reaction is activated with breaking of the C–H bonds in the methyl group. The bands assigned to Co–C3H8*, which indicates a crucial intermediate in the dehydrogenation reaction, diminish earlier in Co@MFI-P50, confirming that propane is more likely to be activated over nanosheet catalysts, which is in line with the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) results (Figure 6e,f). For Co@MFI-P50, C3H6 formation starts at 572 °C and peaks at 694 °C (Figure 6e), which are much lower than the corresponding temperatures for Co@MFI-B130 (617 and 707 °C; Figure 6f). The above results further highlight the efficient effects caused by α-CoO-type sites confined in the straight pore system.

A further kinetic examination was employed using low partial pressures of feed gas to identify the reaction orders of hydrogen and propane. Before the measurements, the effect of mass- and heat-transfer limitations under the experimental conditions needs to be eliminated by keeping propane conversion at less than 15% for all of the samples. In Figure 7a,b, ln[r(C3H6)] versus ln(P) plots were presented to identify the apparent reaction orders of H2 and C3H8. Based on the obtained data, the reaction order of C3H8 remains close to 1 regardless of the morphological change, while the reaction order of H2 differs greatly. For the Co@MFI-B130 catalyst, n[H2] is almost 0, while it decreases to −0.12 with a thinner thickness. Reaction with the first dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step exhibits n[H2] close to 0. (6,53) The mechanism of the PDH reaction over different CoO sites in the MFI framework was subsequently investigated through DFT calculations (Figure 7c). First, H• would be captured by an O atom adjacent to the Lewis CoO site to form Co–C3H7*, thus achieving the activation of propane molecules and cleavage of the heterolytic C–H bond. The C–H dissociation reaction has been confirmed to be the rate-determining step of the PDH process based on the kinetic study. From the results shown here, α-type Co(II) exhibits the lowest energy barrier, and the reaction over β-type Co(II) is the most unfavorable. Afterward, β-H elimination reaction occurs on Co–C3H7* species to form the Co–C3H6* species. Finally, the catalytic process is completed by the stepwise desorption of propylene and hydrogen. In summary, by establishment of the correlation between the location of CoO and the catalytic performance, it was demonstrated that the activation of C–H is more likely to occur over α-type Co(II) compared to the β site or γ type.

3. Conclusion
In this study, the urea addition treatment results in a nanosheet-like structure with smaller dimensions along the straight channel, allowing tuning of the regioselective distribution of the active subnanometric CoO species. The preferential locations in the α-type, which are identified as more ready coordination of electron-donating propane molecules, make them essential to regulate the PDH efficiency. The catalyst exhibits an appealing catalytic performance with an enhanced propylene formation rate of 15 mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1 and a propylene selectivity higher than 95%. This study promotes the concept of regulation of the Lewis acidic property by adjusting the distribution of metal clusters and also opens up a fascinating perspective for combining innovations in anisotropic zeolite crystals and the encapsulation of active sites. More importantly, the accurate detection and direct visualization of the exact location of subnanometric metal entities still need further development. The emerging technologies providing images of the microenvironment of metal entities encapsulated in the zeolitic framework at the atomic scale would advance our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.

Co@MFI nanosheets were synthesized from a gel with a molar composition of 1.0:0.4:35:y:0.04 SiO2/TPAOH/H2O/urea/Co(acac)2. In a typical experiment with molar composition 1.0:0.4:35:0.4:0.04 SiO2/TPAOH/H2O/urea/Co(acac)2. A total of 13.01 g of TPAOH, 0.5 g of Co(acac)2, and 15.45 g of H2O were mixed at room temperature under stirring. Then, 0.96 g of urea was added to the mixture and vigorously stirred for another 2 h. Finally, 8.32 g of TEOS was dropped into the synthesis gel under stirring for 6 h. The obtained gel was heated at 170 °C for 72 h under static conditions. The collected solid products were then dried overnight at 100 °C, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C·min–1. The zeolite sample was denoted as Co@MFI-Px, where x was the thickness according to the SEM images. Reference materials including conventional silicalite-1 crystals and Co@MFI samples without unique morphology via the same crystallization approach are detailed in the Supporting Information.
4.2. Catalytic Activity Evaluation
PDH reactions were conducted at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.1 g of granular catalyst (40–60 mesh) was loaded into the reactor and heated to 600 °C under a 40% H2/N2 atmosphere. The reaction was launched by feeding pure C3H8 into the reactor at a total flow rate of 10 mL·min–1 after temperature stabilization. The WHSV of propane was 7.5 h–1 for the reaction. A cyclic stability test was performed at 600 °C using 0.08 g of catalyst and the same conditions as those mentioned above. Each regeneration includes reactions for 6 h and coke oxidation at 500 °C for 6 h. The reaction product was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-9890B). The C balance was >95% for all of the experiments conducted.
The propane conversion (Conv.) and propylene selectivity (Sele.) were calculated using eqs 1 and 2, respectively, where F is the corresponding flow rate and n is the number of moles of hydrocarbons.

The space-time yield of propylene r(C3H6) (mmolC3H6·gCo–1·min–1) was defined as the number of moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Co per min using eq 3. Here, [FC3H8]in and mCo are the flow rate of the feeding C3H8 and the mass of total Co species in the catalysts based on the mass of catalyst usage and inductively coupled plasma results.

To extract Eapp, the reaction was carried out at different temperatures, and the conversion of propane was also regulated to 15%. The catalytic activation energy (Ea) in the PDH reaction was calculated by the Arrhenius plot based on eq 5, where Aapp is the apparent preexponential factor. Therefore, Eapp can be identified by fitting the slope of the Arrhenius plot using the equation.
