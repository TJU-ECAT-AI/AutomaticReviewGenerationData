[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6 While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt.7 In fact, heating Pt/Al2O3 under oxidizing conditions leads to sintering of Pt, forming large Pt particles.8 To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored.9"
[2] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."
[3] "The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine."
[4] "The CeO2 support is unique because trapping sites allow the size of the PtSn clusters to remain small even when used at such high temperatures."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. Carbon deposits can be oxidized during regeneration, but it is difficult to redistribute platinum (Pt) without the addition of halogens. The use of water vapor can suppress coke formation during propane conversion at high temperatures.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to decreased activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The addition of water vapor to the feed can almost completely eliminate coke deposition, which is traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. Without water vapor, coke content can increase significantly, leading to a drop in conversion.
3.The spent catalyst can be fully regenerated by oxidation treatment, reverting to an atomically dispersed state without the need for added chlorine. This is facilitated by the unique properties of ceria (CeO2) as a support, which allows for the trapping of platinum atoms in ionic form and facilitates redispersion.
4.The use of ceria as a support in PtSn/CeO2 catalysts allows for the formation of stable, subnanometer PtSn clusters that remain small even at high temperatures, which is unique compared to other supports like alumina. This property helps to maintain catalyst stability and activity during propane dehydrogenation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种商业过程，用于生产丙烯，但它是吸热的，需要高温才能达到经济上可行的产量。高温会导致催化剂失活，通过烧结和焦炭形成。碳沉积物可以在再生过程中被氧化，但如果不添加卤素，就很难重新分布铂(Pt)。在高温下进行丙烷转化时，使用水蒸气可以几乎完全消除焦炭沉积。
2.在基于Pt的催化剂上形成焦炭会导致丙烷脱氢中活性和选择性的降低。向进料中添加水蒸气可以几乎完全消除焦炭沉积，这是在高温下进行丙烷转化时通常会看到的。如果没有水蒸气，焦炭含量会显著增加，导致转化率下降。
3.经过氧化处理后，催化剂可以完全再生，恢复到原子分散状态，无需添加氯。这得益于氧化铈(CeO2)作为支撑的独特性质，它允许以离子形式捕获铂原子，并促进再分散。
4.在PtSn/CeO2催化剂中使用氧化铈作为支撑，允许形成稳定的、亚纳米PtSn簇，即使在高温下也能保持小尺寸，这与氧化铝等其他支撑相比是独一无二的。这种性质有助于在丙烷脱氢过程中保持催化剂的稳定性和活性。

2.铈氧化物(CeO2)的氧化还原性质允许使用水蒸气，这几乎完全消除了在高温下丙烷转化过程中通常出现的焦炭沉积。
3.所有这些催化剂在680C下运行6小时后，焦炭含量都非常低，不到1wt%，这是由于向催化剂共喂入水蒸气。当没有向PtSn/CeO2催化剂喂入水蒸气时，焦炭含量从0.5增加到2.8wt%，转化率下降。

[3] "The catalysts undergo calcination in flowing air at 800C to disperse Pt and Sn. In the as-prepared PtSn/CeO2 catalyst (Figure2b), we see atomically dispersed species as well as subnanometer clusters with an average diameter of 0.6nm (Figure2b; FigureS6)."
[4] "The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine."
[5] "The ability of mobile Pt to reduce the dispersed Sn species is similar to that seen previously where Pt was found to reduce PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles.19 What is unique about the CeO2 support is that these PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state (Figure2d). In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst presents particle sizes about 8nm in diameter (FigureS12). The primary mechanism for sintering of the PtSn catalyst is Ostwald ripening at high temperatures. The CeO2 support slows the process of ripening since it is able to trap the Pt atoms."

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种商业过程，用于生产轻烯烃，如丙烯，但由于反应的吸热性质，它需要高温。高温会导致催化剂失活，通过烧结和焦炭形成。碳沉积物可以在再生过程中被氧化，但很难重新分散Pt。在氧化条件下加热Pt/Al2O3会导致Pt烧结，形成大Pt颗粒。为了实现Pt的再分散，通常添加卤素。替代支撑，CeO2，可以将Pt原子捕获在离子形式，促进再分散，无需腐蚀性卤素。CeO2的氧化还原性质允许使用水蒸气，几乎完全消除了在高温下丙烷转化过程中通常看到的焦炭沉积。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响PDH过程的效率。在680C下运行6小时后，PtSn催化剂的焦炭含量非常低，<1wt%，这是由于向催化剂共喂水蒸气。当没有水蒸气喂入PtSn/CeO2催化剂时，焦炭含量从0.5增加到2.8wt%，转化率下降。
3.制备的PtSn/CeO2催化剂含有原子分散的物种以及平均直径为0.6nm的亚纳米簇。
4.在氧化处理后，催化剂很容易恢复到原子分散状态，无需添加氯。
5.CeO2支撑是独一无二的，因为它可以捕获Pt原子，防止PtSn簇在稳态反应过程中增大。相比之下，PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的颗粒尺寸约为8nm。PtSn催化剂烧结的主要机制是高温下的奥斯特瓦尔德熟化。CeO2支撑减缓了烧结过程，因为它能够捕获Pt原子。
