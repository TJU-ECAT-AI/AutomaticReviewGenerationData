[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6 While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt.7 In fact, heating Pt/Al2O3 under oxidizing conditions leads to sintering of Pt, forming large Pt particles.8 To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored.9"
[2] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."
[3] "The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine."
[4] "The CeO2 support is unique because trapping sites allow the size of the PtSn clusters to remain small even when used at such high temperatures."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. Carbon deposits can be oxidized during regeneration, but it is difficult to redistribute platinum (Pt) without the addition of halogens. The use of water vapor can suppress coke formation during propane conversion at high temperatures.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to decreased activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The addition of water vapor to the feed can almost completely eliminate coke deposition, which is traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. Without water vapor, coke content can increase significantly, leading to a drop in conversion.
3.The spent catalyst can be fully regenerated by oxidation treatment, reverting to an atomically dispersed state without the need for added chlorine. This is facilitated by the unique properties of ceria (CeO2) as a support, which allows for the trapping of platinum atoms in ionic form and facilitates redispersion.
4.The use of ceria as a support in PtSn/CeO2 catalysts allows for the formation of stable, subnanometer PtSn clusters that remain small even at high temperatures, which is unique compared to other supports like alumina. This property helps to maintain catalyst stability and activity during propane dehydrogenation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种商业过程，用于生产丙烯，但它是吸热的，需要高温才能达到经济上可行的产量。高温会导致催化剂失活，通过烧结和焦炭形成。碳沉积物可以在再生过程中被氧化，但如果不添加卤素，就很难重新分布铂(Pt)。在高温下进行丙烷转化时，使用水蒸气可以几乎完全消除焦炭沉积。
2.在基于Pt的催化剂上形成焦炭会导致丙烷脱氢中活性和选择性的降低。向进料中添加水蒸气可以几乎完全消除焦炭沉积，这是在高温下进行丙烷转化时通常会看到的。如果没有水蒸气，焦炭含量会显著增加，导致转化率下降。
3.经过氧化处理后，催化剂可以完全再生，恢复到原子分散状态，无需添加氯。这得益于氧化铈(CeO2)作为支撑的独特性质，它允许以离子形式捕获铂原子，并促进再分散。
4.在PtSn/CeO2催化剂中使用氧化铈作为支撑，允许形成稳定的、亚纳米PtSn簇，即使在高温下也能保持小尺寸，这与氧化铝等其他支撑相比是独一无二的。这种性质有助于在丙烷脱氢过程中保持催化剂的稳定性和活性。
