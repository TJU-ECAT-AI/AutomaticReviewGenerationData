[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
[2] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."
[3] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."
[4] "The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields. High reaction temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke formation.
2.The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures.
3.The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C, due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst. When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped.
4.The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种商业过程，用于生产丙烯，但它是吸热的，需要高反应温度才能实现经济上吸引人的产量。高反应温度会导致催化剂失活，因为烧结和焦炭形成。
2.铈氧化物(CeO2)的氧化还原性质允许使用水蒸气，这几乎完全消除了在高温下丙烷转化过程中通常看到的焦炭沉积。
3.在680C下运行6小时后，PtSn催化剂的焦炭含量非常低，小于1wt%，这是由于向催化剂共喂入水蒸气。当没有水蒸气喂入PtSn/CeO2催化剂时，焦炭含量从0.5增加到2.8wt%，转化率下降。
4.在氧化处理后，催化剂很容易恢复到原子分散状态，而无需添加氯。
