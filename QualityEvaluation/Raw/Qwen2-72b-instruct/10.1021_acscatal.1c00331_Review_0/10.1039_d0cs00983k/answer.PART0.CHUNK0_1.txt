1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The conversion in a single pass is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. The process can be transformed from endothermic to exothermic and the equilibrium limitation can be broken if the produced hydrogen is oxidized to water during dehydrogenation. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Commercial processes such as OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used commercially for decades and are still a research hotspot. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes typically occurs at temperatures between 560 and 630 degrees Celsius. The equilibrium conversion decreases exponentially with pressure. Lowering the partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the equilibrium toward dehydrogenation. The actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the equilibrium conversion trend with temperature and pressure, as well as the severity of unselective thermal reactions.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation by reducing catalyst selectivity and causing rapid deactivation. The strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions, including cracking and coking. The origin of permanent deactivation is the sintering of Pt particles. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using a second metal to form alloys with Pt, using a carrier without acidity to reduce coke formation from deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, and improving the coking resistance of the catalyst. The addition of metals like Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts has similar effects as Sn in improving olefin selectivity, reducing coke formation, and enhancing sintering resistance. Non-metal elements like B and Si can also play similar roles in improving catalyst performance.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化受到热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中将产生的氢气氧化成水，不仅可以将吸热过程转变为放热过程，还可以打破平衡限制。PDH由金属复合催化剂和负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业过程如OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4使用负载PtSn或CrOx催化剂。负载Pt催化剂已经商用数十年，仍然是研究热点。轻烷烃脱氢通常在560至630摄氏度的温度范围内进行。平衡转化率随压力呈指数下降。降低氢气的分压会使平衡向脱氢方向移动。脱氢工厂的实际反应温度和压力应根据平衡转化率随温度和压力的变化趋势以及非选择性热反应的严重程度来确定。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂选择性并导致快速失活，影响丙烷脱氢的效率。Pt与烯烃之间的强相互作用导致严重的副反应，包括裂解和焦化。永久失活的根源是Pt颗粒的烧结。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用第二种金属与Pt形成合金，使用无酸载体以减少深脱氢和烃类聚缩合产生的焦炭，以及提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。向Pt催化剂中添加金属如Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Ir、Co具有与Sn类似的效果，可以提高烯烃选择性，减少焦炭形成，增强烧结抗性。非金属元素如B和Si也可以发挥类似的作用，改善催化剂性能。
