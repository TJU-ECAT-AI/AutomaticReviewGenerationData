1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The conversion in a single pass is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. To break this equilibrium and transform the endothermic process into an exothermic one, the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation can be oxidized to water.
2.PDH can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Commercial processes such as OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 typically use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Although supported Pt catalysts have been used commercially for decades, they remain a research hotspot due to their high cost and potential environmental issues with CrOx.
3.The time between regenerations for supported Pt catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, as the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process. Coking deactivation occurs in two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. If coke is formed on the carriers, it does not affect the catalyst's activity but increases the pressure drop of the catalyst bed. The catalyst deactivates only when the Pt particles are covered by coke. Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies.
4.Increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. However, the circulation of hydrogen and the decrease in conversion lead to increased equipment investment and operation costs. The effect of linear velocity on coking is similar to that of space time. The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst. Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam, can also help lengthen the time between regenerations.
5.The addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt and using a carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons. The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts has similar effects as Sn. The addition of B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can also play similar roles. The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is affected by the introduced P content. The dehydrogenation performance of the NiS-based catalyst is higher than that of its phosphide. The sulfides of other metals such as Fe, Co, Mo also have excellent dehydrogenation performance. A fluidized bed reactor equipped with a regenerator and a pre-sulfidation section can replenish the lost sulfur on the catalyst, enabling continuous dehydrogenation-regeneration-sulfidation operation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化受到热力学平衡的限制。为了打破这一平衡，将脱氢过程中产生的氢气氧化成水，可以将吸热过程转化为放热过程。
2.PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂和负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业过程如OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4通常使用负载PtSn或CrOx催化剂。尽管负载Pt催化剂已经商用数十年，但由于其高成本和CrOx潜在的环境问题，它们仍然是研究热点。
3.对于轻烷烃脱氢中使用的负载Pt催化剂，再生时间间隔由焦炭生成速率决定，因为反应过程中Pt的烧结是一个相对较慢的过程。焦炭失活分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳态。失活程度不能简单地与沉积的焦炭量和性质相关联。如果焦炭在载体上形成，它不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降。只有当Pt颗粒被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭生成速率和延长再生时间间隔对于改善轻烷烃脱氢技术至关重要。
4.增加氢气的分压是抑制焦炭生成的最常见措施。然而，氢气循环和转化率下降导致设备投资和运营成本增加。线速度对焦炭生成的影响与空间时间相似。影响再生时间间隔最重要的因素是催化剂的组成。提高催化剂的焦炭抗性是延长再生时间间隔最有效的方法。通过引入氢气或蒸汽优化反应条件也可以帮助延长再生时间间隔。
5.添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金并使用无酸性的载体可以减少由深度脱氢和烃类聚合作用形成的焦炭。向Pt催化剂中添加Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Ir、Co具有与Sn类似的效果。添加B和Si两种非金属元素也可以发挥类似的作用。NiP催化剂的脱氢性能受引入的P含量影响。NiS基催化剂的脱氢性能高于其磷化物。其他金属如Fe、Co、Mo的硫化物也具有优异的脱氢性能。配备再生器和预硫化段的流化床反应器可以补充催化剂上损失的硫，实现连续脱氢-再生-硫化操作。

The actual reaction temperature and pressure for dehydrogenation plants should be determined by the equilibrium conversion trend with temperature and pressure, as well as the severity of unselective thermal reactions.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation by reducing catalyst selectivity and causing rapid deactivation. The strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions, including cracking and coking. The origin of permanent deactivation is the sintering of Pt particles. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using a second metal to form alloys with Pt, using a carrier without acidity to reduce coke formation from deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, and improving the coking resistance of the catalyst. The addition of metals like Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts has similar effects as Sn in improving olefin selectivity, reducing coke formation, and enhancing sintering resistance. Non-metal elements like B and Si can also play similar roles in improving catalyst performance.

2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂选择性并导致快速失活，影响丙烷脱氢的效率。Pt与烯烃之间的强相互作用导致严重的副反应，包括裂解和焦化。永久失活的根源是Pt颗粒的烧结。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用第二种金属与Pt形成合金，使用无酸载体以减少深脱氢和烃类聚缩合产生的焦炭，以及提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。向Pt催化剂中添加金属如Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Ir、Co具有与Sn类似的效果，可以提高烯烃选择性，减少焦炭形成，增强烧结抗性。非金属元素如B和Si也可以发挥类似的作用，改善催化剂性能。

[1] "In the past several decades, light alkane dehydrogenation to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[3] "However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment- friendly catalysts."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
[6] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
[7] "Moreover, there are many reports on the improvement of traditional supported CrOx catalysts."
[8] "It is worth noting that some novel and interesting dehydrogenation catalysts have also been reported recently."
[9] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes often proceeds in the range of 560630 1C."
[10] "If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed by the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed, and then the temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds."
[11] "The main side products of the thermal decomposition of propane include H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and coke."
[12] "The acidity of the carriers can catalyze both the cracking of light alkanes and coking, especially the polycondensation of unsaturated hydrocarbons to form coke."
[13] "The monometallic Pt can not only promote the formation of coke or coke precursors via deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, but also expedite the cleavage of CC bonds."
[14] "The spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."
[15] "This step is called oxychlorination regeneration."
[16] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
[17] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
[18] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
[19] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
[20] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
[21] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
[22] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
[23] "Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature."
[24] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
[25] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
[26] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
[27] "Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
[28] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."
[29] "This step is called oxychlorination regeneration."
[30] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
[31] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
[32] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
[33] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
[34] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
[35] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
[36] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
[37] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
[38] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
[39] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
[40] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
[41] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
[42] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
[43] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
[44] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
[45] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
[46] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
[47] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
[48] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
[49] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
[50] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
[51] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
[52] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
[53] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
[54] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
[55] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
[56] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
[57] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
[58] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
[59] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
[60] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
[61] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that has gained widespread attention and development in research and commercial applications over the past several decades. Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industry and exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. However, the high cost of Pt and environmental concerns about CrOx have led researchers to focus on improving the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts and finding new non-noble metal and environmentally friendly catalysts. Metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts can catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes. In commercial processes such as OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts are applied. Although supported Pt catalysts have been commercially used for several decades, they are still a research hotspot. There are many reports on the improvement of traditional supported CrOx catalysts. Some novel and interesting dehydrogenation catalysts have also been reported recently.
2.Light alkane dehydrogenation often proceeds in the range of 560-630°C. If the reactors are operated adiabatically, the heat needed for the reaction is mainly supplied by the preheated feed, and the temperature of the feed before entering the reactors must be higher than the highest temperature of the catalyst beds. The main side products of the thermal decomposition of propane include H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and coke. The acidity of the carriers can catalyze both the cracking of light alkanes and coking, especially the polycondensation of unsaturated hydrocarbons to form coke. The monometallic Pt can not only promote the formation of coke or coke precursors via deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons but also expedite the cleavage of CC bonds.
3.The spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally chlorine), which is used to redisperse sintered Pt particles. This step is called oxychlorination regeneration. Although there are many negative effects of introducing chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen. The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce. The application of carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate. Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, significantly preventing the sintering of Pt. MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier. Generally, Pt is not directly loaded on MgAl2O4 spinel prepared beforehand, but firstly loaded into the spaces between the layers of MgAlOx hydrotalcite, and then Pt particles are enclosed in the interspace of MgAl2O4 spinel formed through the collapse of the layered structure of the hydrotalcite after calcination at high temperature. In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones. The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt. To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles. This step is called oxychlorination regeneration. Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen.
4.The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process. Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently. It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop. The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number. As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity. Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation. Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst. For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor. For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition. Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations. Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation. The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost. Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed. Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent. For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680°C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%. As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure. Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice. Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity. The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite. The increased formation of side products includes coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking. Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity. The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time. In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity. Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations. The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst. Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity. The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively. Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor. Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种方法，过去几十年在研究和商业应用领域得到了广泛关注和大量发展。工业中广泛使用的支撑PtSn和CrOx催化剂表现出令人满意的脱氢活性和选择性。然而，Pt的高成本和CrOx的潜在环境问题促使研究人员致力于提高Pt催化剂的焦炭和烧结抗性，以及寻找新的非贵金属和环保催化剂。金属复合催化剂和支撑金属或金属氧化物催化剂可以催化烷烃的脱氢。在OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4等商业过程中，应用了支撑PtSn或CrOx催化剂。尽管支撑Pt催化剂在过去的几十年中已经商业化使用，但它们仍然是研究热点。有许多关于传统支撑CrOx催化剂改进的报道。最近还报道了一些新颖有趣的脱氢催化剂。
2.轻烷烃脱氢通常在560-630°C的范围内进行。如果反应器以绝热方式运行，反应所需的热量主要由预热的进料提供，进料在进入反应器前的温度必须高于催化剂床层的最高温度。丙烷热分解的主要副产品包括H2、CH4、C2H4、C2H6和焦炭。载体的酸性可以催化轻烷烃的裂解和焦炭的形成，特别是不饱和烃的多聚化形成焦炭。单金属Pt不仅可以促进通过深度脱氢形成烃的焦炭或焦炭前体，还可以加速CC键的断裂。
3.在存在卤化物(通常是氯)的情况下，用空气再生失活催化剂，其作用是重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒。这一步骤称为氧氯化再生。尽管将氯引入装置有许多负面影响，但由于没有其他更好的选择，必须采用这种方法。添加第二种金属被发现对Pt颗粒的烧结抗性有高度效果。引入的金属与Pt形成合金，围绕Pt颗粒，合金将它们锚定在载体表面，使它们不易迁移和聚集。应用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体是另一种减缓烧结的方法。Al2O3是最常见的Pt催化剂载体，在其中，配位不饱和的五配位Al3+可以锚定Pt，使其不易迁移。纳米碳也被报道为Pt的载体，以提高烧结抗性，强金属载体相互作用导致电子从纳米碳转移到Pt颗粒，显著防止Pt的烧结。MgAl2O4尖晶石也是载体的良好选择。通常，Pt不是直接加载到预先制备的MgAl2O4尖晶石上，而是首先加载到MgAlOx水滑石层间空间，然后Pt颗粒被封装在通过高温煅烧水滑石层状结构坍塌形成的MgAl2O4尖晶石的层间空间中。这样，隔离的Pt颗粒不易迁移成大颗粒。引入第二种金属或选择合适的载体仅能减缓Pt的烧结速率。为了完全恢复活性，烧结的Pt颗粒必须重新分散。通常，简单的空气烧焦不能实现再分散，反而会加剧Pt颗粒的烧结。对于使用支撑Pt催化剂的商业脱氢装置，失活催化剂在存在卤化物(通常是氯)的情况下用空气再生，其作用是重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒。这一步骤称为氧氯化再生。尽管将氯引入装置有许多负面影响，但由于没有其他更好的选择，必须采用这种方法。
4.在支撑Pt催化剂的轻烷烃脱氢中，再生时间间隔由焦炭速率决定，因为反应中的Pt烧结是一个相对较慢的过程。焦炭失活分为两个不同的阶段，快速失活和稳态。活性的损失不能简单地与沉积的焦炭量和性质相关联。如果焦炭在载体上形成，催化剂的活性不会受到影响，但催化剂床层的压力降会随之增加。值得注意的是，随着压力降的增加，转化率和选择性都会降低。由于脱氢是随着摩尔数增加的可逆反应，转化率会降低。至于烯烃的选择性，由于裂解和焦炭等副反应是不可逆反应，当脱氢被抑制时，副反应的比例会增加，导致烯烃选择性降低。只有当Pt颗粒被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间间隔对于改善轻烷烃脱氢技术至关重要。就像Pt的烧结一样，焦炭是不可避免的，但可以采取一些措施来减缓焦炭形成速率，包括优化反应条件和催化剂。对于反应条件，焦炭速率受H2、H2O、烃的分压以及油蒸气的空间时间和线速度的影响。对于催化剂，最重要的因素是其组成。增加H2的分压是抑制焦炭形成的最常见措施。在Honeywell UOP的OleflexTM工艺中，采取了这一措施来控制焦炭速率并调整再生时间间隔。通过增加H2的分压来减少焦炭形成是以轻烷烃转化率降低为代价的，因为这对脱氢热力学不利。H2的循环和转化率的降低将导致设备投资和运营成本的增加。向反应器中引入少量H2O也可以显著减少焦炭，但由于与进料的竞争吸附，转化率会降低。提高反应温度会在一定程度上削弱H2O对转化率的影响。例如，当在进料中加入少量H2O时，PtSn/CeO2催化剂在680°C下的丙烷转化率约为40%，焦炭形成几乎完全从2.8%抑制到0.5%。至于烃的分压，应在不影响装置稳定和安全运行的情况下尽可能保持较低，因为转化率会随着压力的升高而降低，焦炭产量也会增加。通常，调整烃的分压以减少焦炭形成在实践中不被考虑。空间时间影响转化率和选择性。转化率随其增加而增加，而选择性则相反。副产物的形成增加，包括焦炭和由裂解产生的较小分子。虽然缩短空间时间可以减少甚至几乎避免焦炭形成，但更重要的是转化率和选择性之间的平衡。线速度对焦炭的影响与空间时间相似。在恒定的空间时间下，线速度的增加不利于形成的烯烃在催化剂表面的吸附，并降低了油蒸气的返混程度，从而抑制了烯烃的二次反应，包括聚合成焦炭，尽管由于催化剂床层压力降的增加，线速度不能大幅提高，压力降与速度的平方成正比。因此，这一措施不适用于延长再生时间间隔。影响再生时间间隔的最重要因素是催化剂的组成。金属和载体都可能催化焦炭的形成，如在副反应和选择性部分所述。添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金，以及使用无酸性的载体，可以分别减少深度脱氢和烃类聚合成焦炭形成的焦炭。Jiang等人建议，在Al2O3载体中添加约10 wt%的TiO2可以抑制焦炭形成，因为部分还原的TiOx物种向Pt的电子捐赠导致电子丰富的Pt颗粒，抑制了丙烯的吸附和焦炭前体的形成。提高催化剂的焦炭抗性是延长再生时间间隔最有效的方法。此外，优化反应条件也可以帮助延长再生时间间隔，例如引入氢气或蒸汽。

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

1. 丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化成水，吸热过程将变成放热过程，平衡限制将被打破。PDH由金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。
2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken.
2.PDH can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Commercial processes like OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Although supported Pt catalysts have been used commercially for decades, they remain a research hotspot.
3.The time between regenerations for supported Pt catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking. Coking deactivation has two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. If coke forms on the carriers, the catalyst's activity is unaffected, but the pressure drop of the catalyst bed increases. The catalyst deactivates only when Pt particles are covered by coke.
4.Increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. However, this reduces the conversion of light alkanes, as it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation. The circulation of hydrogen and the decrease in conversion lead to increased equipment investment and operation costs.
5.Introducing a small amount of water into the reactor can significantly reduce coke formation, but it decreases the conversion due to competitive adsorption with the feed. Increasing the reaction temperature weakens the effect of water on conversion. For example, adding a little water to the feed results in about 40% propane conversion over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst at 680°C, and coke formation is almost completely suppressed from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%.
6.The effect of linear velocity on coking is similar to that of space time. In the case of constant space time, increasing the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, inhibiting secondary reactions of olefins, including polycondensation to coke. However, the linear velocity cannot be greatly increased due to the increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity.
7.The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst. Both metals and carriers may catalyze the formation of coke. The addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt and using a carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively. Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. Optimizing reaction conditions, such as introducing hydrogen or steam, can also help lengthen the time between regenerations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。
2.PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂和负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业过程如OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4使用负载PtSn或CrOx催化剂。尽管负载Pt催化剂已经商用几十年，但它们仍然是研究热点。
3.在轻烷烃脱氢中，负载Pt催化剂的再生时间由积炭速率决定。积炭失活分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳态。失活程度与积炭量和性质没有简单相关性。如果积炭在载体上形成，催化剂的活性不会受到影响，但催化剂床的压力降会增加。只有当Pt颗粒被积炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。
4.增加氢气的分压是抑制积炭形成的最常见措施。然而，这会降低轻烷烃的转化率，因为这对脱氢过程热力学不利。氢气的循环和转化率的降低会导致设备投资和运营成本的增加。
5.向反应器中引入少量水可以显著减少积炭形成，但会因与进料的竞争吸附而降低转化率。提高反应温度会削弱水对转化率的影响。例如，在进料中加入少量水，PtSn/CeO2催化剂在680°C下的丙烷转化率约为40%，积炭形成几乎完全从2.8%抑制到0.5%。
6.线速度对积炭的影响与停留时间相似。在恒定停留时间的情况下，增加线速度不利于形成的烯烃在催化剂表面的吸附，降低了油蒸汽的返混程度，从而抑制了烯烃的二次反应，包括聚合成焦。然而，由于催化剂床压力降与速度的平方成正比，线速度不能大幅增加。
7.影响再生时间的最重要因素是催化剂的组成。金属和载体都可能催化积炭的形成。添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金以及使用无酸性的载体可以分别减少由深度脱氢和烃类聚合成焦形成的积炭。提高催化剂的抗积炭能力是延长再生时间的最有效方法。优化反应条件，如引入氢气或蒸汽，也可以帮助延长再生时间。
