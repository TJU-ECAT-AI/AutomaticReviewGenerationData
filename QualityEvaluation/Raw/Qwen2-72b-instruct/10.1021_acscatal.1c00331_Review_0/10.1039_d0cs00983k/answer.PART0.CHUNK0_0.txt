[1] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
[2] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."

[5] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
[6] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
[7] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
[8] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The conversion in a single pass is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. To break this equilibrium and transform the endothermic process into an exothermic one, the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation can be oxidized to water.
2.PDH can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts. Commercial processes such as OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4 typically use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Although supported Pt catalysts have been used commercially for decades, they remain a research hotspot due to their high cost and potential environmental issues with CrOx.
3.The time between regenerations for supported Pt catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, as the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process. Coking deactivation occurs in two stages: quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. If coke is formed on the carriers, it does not affect the catalyst's activity but increases the pressure drop of the catalyst bed. The catalyst deactivates only when the Pt particles are covered by coke. Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving light alkane dehydrogenation technologies.
4.Increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. However, the circulation of hydrogen and the decrease in conversion lead to increased equipment investment and operation costs. The effect of linear velocity on coking is similar to that of space time. The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst. Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam, can also help lengthen the time between regenerations.
5.The addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt and using a carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons. The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts has similar effects as Sn. The addition of B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can also play similar roles. The dehydrogenation performance of the NiP catalyst is affected by the introduced P content. The dehydrogenation performance of the NiS-based catalyst is higher than that of its phosphide. The sulfides of other metals such as Fe, Co, Mo also have excellent dehydrogenation performance. A fluidized bed reactor equipped with a regenerator and a pre-sulfidation section can replenish the lost sulfur on the catalyst, enabling continuous dehydrogenation-regeneration-sulfidation operation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化受到热力学平衡的限制。为了打破这一平衡，将脱氢过程中产生的氢气氧化成水，可以将吸热过程转化为放热过程。
2.PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂和负载金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业过程如OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4通常使用负载PtSn或CrOx催化剂。尽管负载Pt催化剂已经商用数十年，但由于其高成本和CrOx潜在的环境问题，它们仍然是研究热点。
3.对于轻烷烃脱氢中使用的负载Pt催化剂，再生时间间隔由焦炭生成速率决定，因为反应过程中Pt的烧结是一个相对较慢的过程。焦炭失活分为两个阶段：快速失活和稳态。失活程度不能简单地与沉积的焦炭量和性质相关联。如果焦炭在载体上形成，它不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降。只有当Pt颗粒被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭生成速率和延长再生时间间隔对于改善轻烷烃脱氢技术至关重要。
4.增加氢气的分压是抑制焦炭生成的最常见措施。然而，氢气循环和转化率下降导致设备投资和运营成本增加。线速度对焦炭生成的影响与空间时间相似。影响再生时间间隔最重要的因素是催化剂的组成。提高催化剂的焦炭抗性是延长再生时间间隔最有效的方法。通过引入氢气或蒸汽优化反应条件也可以帮助延长再生时间间隔。
5.添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金并使用无酸性的载体可以减少由深度脱氢和烃类聚合作用形成的焦炭。向Pt催化剂中添加Ga、In、Zn、Cu、Ir、Co具有与Sn类似的效果。添加B和Si两种非金属元素也可以发挥类似的作用。NiP催化剂的脱氢性能受引入的P含量影响。NiS基催化剂的脱氢性能高于其磷化物。其他金属如Fe、Co、Mo的硫化物也具有优异的脱氢性能。配备再生器和预硫化段的流化床反应器可以补充催化剂上损失的硫，实现连续脱氢-再生-硫化操作。
