[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
[9] "However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by the conventional alloying approach."
[10] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
[11] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."

1.PDH is a method for propene production that requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields, leading to catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The key considerations for PDH include the use of stable catalysts that can withstand high temperatures without deactivation, which is crucial for industrial applications. Pt- and Cr2O3-based materials are promising catalysts for PDH to meet the increasing demand for propylene. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing severe deactivation, necessitating continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the isolation of Pt atoms, which can be achieved through alloying with inactive metals like Sn to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. However, complete isolation of Pt atoms is challenging using conventional alloying approaches, and single-atom or single-atom alloy catalysts, while effective, have limitations in high-temperature reactions due to insufficient thermal stability.

1.PDH是一种丙烯生产方法，需要高温以实现足够的产量，这会导致催化剂因焦炭形成而失活。PDH的关键考虑因素包括使用能够在高温下不发生失活的稳定催化剂，这对于工业应用至关重要。Pt和Cr2O3基材料是PDH的有前途的催化剂，以满足对丙烯日益增长的需求。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过引起严重失活影响过程效率，需要催化剂的连续或短周期再生。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括隔离Pt原子，这可以通过与Sn等惰性金属合金化来实现，以稀释PtPt集合体并增强丙烯选择性和稳定性。然而，使用传统的合金化方法完全隔离Pt原子具有挑战性，而单原子或单原子合金催化剂虽然有效，但在高温反应中由于热稳定性不足而存在局限性。
