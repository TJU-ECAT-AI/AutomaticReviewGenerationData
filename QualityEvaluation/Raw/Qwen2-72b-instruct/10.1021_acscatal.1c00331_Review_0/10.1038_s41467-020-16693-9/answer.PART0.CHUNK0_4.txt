[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by the conventional alloying approach."
[9] "Single-atom1215 and single-atom alloy11,16 catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt,where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu,respectively."
[10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms17 or alloy nanoparticles11,16 without spatial separation13 are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
2.Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry.
3.Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production.
4.Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use.
5.Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation.
6.Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。
2.开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。
3.使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。
4.在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。
5.PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。
6.基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。
7.隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。
8.然而,使用传统的合金化方法完全隔离Pt原子是困难的。
9.单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。
10.将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。
11.可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。
