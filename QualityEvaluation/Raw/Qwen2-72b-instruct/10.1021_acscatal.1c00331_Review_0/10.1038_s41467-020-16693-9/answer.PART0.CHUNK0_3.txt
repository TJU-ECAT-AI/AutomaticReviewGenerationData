[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[6] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[7] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this high-temperature condition leads to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that can withstand high temperatures without deactivation is crucial for the industry. PDH using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the growing global demand for propylene production. However, under harsh conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis, leading to the formation of coke. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH. Generally, the selectivity and stability of PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法，需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而，这种高温条件导致显著的催化剂失活，原因是焦炭的形成。开发在高温下具有高稳定性的PDH催化剂，即使在高温下也不会失活，对工业至关重要。使用Pt-或Cr2O3基材料的PDH是一种有前景的技术，可以满足全球对丙烯生产的日益增长的需求。然而，在恶劣条件下，由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结，严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的，这要求在实际使用中连续或在短时间内再生催化剂。对于Pt基催化剂，已知PtPt集合体对丙烯的过度脱氢和氢解具有活性，导致焦炭的形成。Pt原子的隔离是抑制PDH中这些不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。一般来说，PDH的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定，如进一步的CH(C)断裂和随后的焦炭形成。
