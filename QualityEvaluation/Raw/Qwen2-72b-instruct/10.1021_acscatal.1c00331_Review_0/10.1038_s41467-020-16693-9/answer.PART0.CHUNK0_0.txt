[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
[9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
[10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
[11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[12] "For instance, the 1:1 compound of Pt and Ga with cubic P213 space group has thermal stability (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ/mol) much greater than typical random alloys (10 < ΔHf 0 kJ mol-1) and a unique structure for this purpose."
[13] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
[14] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
[15] "Note that there are two enantiomeric forms of PtGa unit cell (PtGa:A and PtGa:B, the former is shown in Fig. 1), because the space group P213 is chiral."
[16] "In an analogous system of PdGa (space group P213), such surface termination (Pd3 and Pd1, which were described as trimer and single atom, respectively) has actually been observed by surface science techniques."
[17] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1."
[18] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[19] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[20] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[21] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
[22] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
[23] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
[24] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this leads to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation at high temperatures is crucial for industrial applications.
2.Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are promising catalysts for PDH to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under harsh conditions, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration.
3.Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. PtPt ensembles are active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis, while the isolation of Pt atoms can inhibit these side reactions.
4.Alloying active main metal (Pt) with inactive metal (Sn) can dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts can also use isolated Pt, but their thermal stability is insufficient for high-temperature reactions like PDH.
5.Single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as the 1:1 compound of Pt and Ga with cubic P213 space group, is a promising candidate for PDH. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites.
6.The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom, which can be described as single-atom Pt. In an analogous system of PdGa, surface termination (Pd3 and Pd1) has been observed by surface science techniques, with Pd3 being more selective for semihydrogenation of acetylene than Pd1.
7.For PtGa in PDH, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions, requiring modification to disable only Pt3 sites while keeping Pt1 sites available for the reaction. Pb-modified PtGa, where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact, is designed for this purpose.
8.SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method and tested in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without performance degradation.
9.Single-atom Pt catalyzes the first and second CH activation while effectively inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions to coke and improving selectivity and stability.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种方法，需要高温反应以获得足够的丙烯产量。然而，这会导致显著的催化剂失活，因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定PDH催化剂对于工业应用至关重要。
2.Pt-或Cr2O3基材料是PDH的有前途的催化剂，以满足全球对丙烯生产日益增长的需求。然而，在恶劣条件下，由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结导致的严重催化剂失活是不可避免的，需要连续或短周期再生。
3.PDH的选择性和稳定性由丙烯脱附和不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定，如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。PtPt集合体对丙烯的过度脱氢和氢解具有活性，而Pt原子的隔离可以抑制这些副反应。
4.将活性主金属(Pt)与惰性金属(Sn)合金化可以稀释PtPt集合体，提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。单原子和单原子合金催化剂也可以使用孤立的Pt，但它们的热稳定性不足以用于像PDH这样的高温反应。
5.像Pt和Ga的1:1化合物(立方P213空间群)这样的热稳定金属间化合物中包含的类似单原子的孤立Pt是PDH的一个有希望的候选者。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止，显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。
6.Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质，可以将其描述为单原子Pt。在类似PdGa的系统中，表面终止(Pd3和Pd1)已被表面科学方法观察到，Pd3对乙炔半氢化比Pd1更具选择性。
7.对于PDH中的PtGa，Pt3位点预计对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃，需要修改以仅禁用Pt3位点，同时保持Pt1位点可用于反应。设计了Pb改性的PtGa，其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞，而单原子Pt保持完整。
8.通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂，并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性，而性能没有下降。
9.单原子Pt催化第一次和第二次CH活化，同时有效地抑制第三次，最小化副反应到焦炭，提高选择性和稳定性。
