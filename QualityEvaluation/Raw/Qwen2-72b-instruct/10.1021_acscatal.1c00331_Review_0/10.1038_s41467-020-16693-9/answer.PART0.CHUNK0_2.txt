[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
[9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
[10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
[11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites (hereafter signed Pt1, Ga1, Pt3, and Ga3)."
[13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
[14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) cat- alysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 C)."
[18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
[19] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
[20] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
[21] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
[22] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
[23] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
[24] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
[25] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
[26] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
[27] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
[28] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for propene production requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields, which can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This is a critical issue for industrial applications, as it affects process efficiency and catalyst regeneration.
2.Catalyst stability and selectivity in PDH are determined by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly those with PtPt ensembles, are prone to these side reactions, leading to coke formation and deactivation.
3.Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the isolation of Pt atoms, alloying with inactive metals like Sn, and the use of single-atom or single-atom alloy catalysts. However, these approaches may not be suitable for high-temperature reactions due to thermal instability.
4.A promising solution is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt in thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, where the Pt1 site can be described as single-atom Pt. By selectively blocking the Pt3 sites with Pb deposition while keeping the Pt1 sites available, highly selective and stable PDH can be achieved.
5.PtGaPb catalysts, prepared by impregnation and tested at high temperatures, exhibit outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with high conversion and selectivity even under harsh conditions. The Pb modification significantly improves stability and selectivity, allowing for long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production without deactivation.
6.At higher temperatures, such as 650 C, the stability of PtGaPb decreases due to thermal cracking, but it remains superior to other catalysts. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and Pb modification stabilizes single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperatures, with PtGa's thermodynamic stability and Pb's large atomic radius preventing diffusion into the bulk of PtGa.
7.The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites in PtGaPb minimizes coke accumulation, leading to outstanding catalyst stability. This design provides significant insights for material design to isolate and stabilize active metals for alkane dehydrogenation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯需要高温以获得足够的丙烯产量，这会导致显著的催化剂失活，因为会形成焦炭。这对工业应用至关重要，因为它影响过程效率和催化剂再生。
2.在PDH中，催化剂的稳定性和选择性由丙烯脱附和不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定，这些副反应包括进一步的CH(C)断裂和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂，特别是那些具有PtPt集合体的催化剂，容易发生这些副反应，导致焦炭形成和失活。
3.缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括隔离Pt原子，与像Sn这样的惰性金属合金化，以及使用单原子或单原子合金催化剂。然而，这些方法可能不适合高温反应，因为热稳定性不足。
4.一个有希望的解决方案是使用热稳定间金属化合物中的单原子样隔离Pt，例如PtGa，其中Pt1位点可以描述为单原子Pt。通过选择性地用Pb沉积阻塞Pt3位点，同时保持Pt1位点可用，可以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。
5.PtGaPb催化剂，通过浸渍制备并在高温下测试，表现出在PDH中出色的催化性能，即使在恶劣条件下也具有高转化率和选择性。Pb改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性，允许长期、连续和高选择性地生产丙烯，而不会失活。
6.在更高的温度下，例如650°C，PtGaPb的稳定性降低，因为发生了热裂解，但与其它催化剂相比，它仍然优越。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合在高温下稳定了单原子样隔离的Pt，PtGa的热力学稳定性和Pb的大原子半径阻止了Pb向PtGa体内的扩散。
7.PtGaPb中Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭积累，导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。这种设计为材料设计提供了重要的见解，以隔离和稳定用于烷烃脱氢的活性金属。
