          [1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."

          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。
