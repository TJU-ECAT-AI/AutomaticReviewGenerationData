[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
[2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
[3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
[4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
[5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
[6] "PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
[7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
[8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
[9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
[10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
[11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
[12] "For instance, the 1:1 compound of Pt and Ga with cubic P213 space group has thermal stability (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ/mol) much greater than typical random alloys (10 < ΔHf 0 kJ mol-1) and a unique structure for this purpose."
[13] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
[14] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
[15] "Note that there are two enantiomeric forms of PtGa unit cell (PtGa:A and PtGa:B, the former is shown in Fig. 1), because the space group P213 is chiral."
[16] "In an analogous system of PdGa (space group P213), such surface termination (Pd3 and Pd1, which were described as trimer and single atom, respectively) has actually been observed by surface science techniques."
[17] "For the PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of acetylene more selectively than Pd1."
[18] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
[19] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
[20] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
[21] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
[22] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
[23] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
[24] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this leads to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation at high temperatures is crucial for industrial applications.
2.Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are promising catalysts for PDH to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under harsh conditions, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration.
3.Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. PtPt ensembles are active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis, while the isolation of Pt atoms can inhibit these side reactions.
4.Alloying active main metal (Pt) with inactive metal (Sn) can dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts can also use isolated Pt, but their thermal stability is insufficient for high-temperature reactions like PDH.
5.Single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as the 1:1 compound of Pt and Ga with cubic P213 space group, is a promising candidate for PDH. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites.
6.The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom, which can be described as single-atom Pt. In an analogous system of PdGa, surface termination (Pd3 and Pd1) has been observed by surface science techniques, with Pd3 being more selective for semihydrogenation of acetylene than Pd1.
7.For PtGa in PDH, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions, requiring modification to disable only Pt3 sites while keeping Pt1 sites available for the reaction. Pb-modified PtGa, where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact, is designed for this purpose.
8.SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method and tested in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without performance degradation.
9.Single-atom Pt catalyzes the first and second CH activation while effectively inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions to coke and improving selectivity and stability.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种方法，需要高温反应以获得足够的丙烯产量。然而，这会导致显著的催化剂失活，因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定PDH催化剂对于工业应用至关重要。
2.Pt-或Cr2O3基材料是PDH的有前途的催化剂，以满足全球对丙烯生产日益增长的需求。然而，在恶劣条件下，由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结导致的严重催化剂失活是不可避免的，需要连续或短周期再生。
3.PDH的选择性和稳定性由丙烯脱附和不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定，如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。PtPt集合体对丙烯的过度脱氢和氢解具有活性，而Pt原子的隔离可以抑制这些副反应。
4.将活性主金属(Pt)与惰性金属(Sn)合金化可以稀释PtPt集合体，提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。单原子和单原子合金催化剂也可以使用孤立的Pt，但它们的热稳定性不足以用于像PDH这样的高温反应。
5.像Pt和Ga的1:1化合物(立方P213空间群)这样的热稳定金属间化合物中包含的类似单原子的孤立Pt是PDH的一个有希望的候选者。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止，显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。
6.Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质，可以将其描述为单原子Pt。在类似PdGa的系统中，表面终止(Pd3和Pd1)已被表面科学方法观察到，Pd3对乙炔半氢化比Pd1更具选择性。
7.对于PDH中的PtGa，Pt3位点预计对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃，需要修改以仅禁用Pt3位点，同时保持Pt1位点可用于反应。设计了Pb改性的PtGa，其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞，而单原子Pt保持完整。
8.通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂，并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性，而性能没有下降。
9.单原子Pt催化第一次和第二次CH活化，同时有效地抑制第三次，最小化副反应到焦炭，提高选择性和稳定性。

1.PDH is a method for propene production that requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields, leading to catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The key considerations for PDH include the use of stable catalysts that can withstand high temperatures without deactivation, which is crucial for industrial applications. Pt- and Cr2O3-based materials are promising catalysts for PDH to meet the increasing demand for propylene. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by causing severe deactivation, necessitating continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the isolation of Pt atoms, which can be achieved through alloying with inactive metals like Sn to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. However, complete isolation of Pt atoms is challenging using conventional alloying approaches, and single-atom or single-atom alloy catalysts, while effective, have limitations in high-temperature reactions due to insufficient thermal stability.

[26] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for propene production requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields, which can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This is a critical issue for industrial applications, as it affects process efficiency and catalyst regeneration.
2.Catalyst stability and selectivity in PDH are determined by the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly those with PtPt ensembles, are prone to these side reactions, leading to coke formation and deactivation.
3.Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the isolation of Pt atoms, alloying with inactive metals like Sn, and the use of single-atom or single-atom alloy catalysts. However, these approaches may not be suitable for high-temperature reactions due to thermal instability.
4.A promising solution is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt in thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, where the Pt1 site can be described as single-atom Pt. By selectively blocking the Pt3 sites with Pb deposition while keeping the Pt1 sites available, highly selective and stable PDH can be achieved.
5.PtGaPb catalysts, prepared by impregnation and tested at high temperatures, exhibit outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with high conversion and selectivity even under harsh conditions. The Pb modification significantly improves stability and selectivity, allowing for long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production without deactivation.
6.At higher temperatures, such as 650 C, the stability of PtGaPb decreases due to thermal cracking, but it remains superior to other catalysts. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and Pb modification stabilizes single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperatures, with PtGa's thermodynamic stability and Pb's large atomic radius preventing diffusion into the bulk of PtGa.
7.The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites in PtGaPb minimizes coke accumulation, leading to outstanding catalyst stability. This design provides significant insights for material design to isolate and stabilize active metals for alkane dehydrogenation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯需要高温以获得足够的丙烯产量，这会导致显著的催化剂失活，因为会形成焦炭。这对工业应用至关重要，因为它影响过程效率和催化剂再生。
2.在PDH中，催化剂的稳定性和选择性由丙烯脱附和不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定，这些副反应包括进一步的CH(C)断裂和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂，特别是那些具有PtPt集合体的催化剂，容易发生这些副反应，导致焦炭形成和失活。
3.缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括隔离Pt原子，与像Sn这样的惰性金属合金化，以及使用单原子或单原子合金催化剂。然而，这些方法可能不适合高温反应，因为热稳定性不足。
4.一个有希望的解决方案是使用热稳定间金属化合物中的单原子样隔离Pt，例如PtGa，其中Pt1位点可以描述为单原子Pt。通过选择性地用Pb沉积阻塞Pt3位点，同时保持Pt1位点可用，可以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。
5.PtGaPb催化剂，通过浸渍制备并在高温下测试，表现出在PDH中出色的催化性能，即使在恶劣条件下也具有高转化率和选择性。Pb改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性，允许长期、连续和高选择性地生产丙烯，而不会失活。
6.在更高的温度下，例如650°C，PtGaPb的稳定性降低，因为发生了热裂解，但与其它催化剂相比，它仍然优越。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合在高温下稳定了单原子样隔离的Pt，PtGa的热力学稳定性和Pb的大原子半径阻止了Pb向PtGa体内的扩散。
7.PtGaPb中Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭积累，导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。这种设计为材料设计提供了重要的见解，以隔离和稳定用于烷烃脱氢的活性金属。

9.单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。
10.将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。
11.可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。
