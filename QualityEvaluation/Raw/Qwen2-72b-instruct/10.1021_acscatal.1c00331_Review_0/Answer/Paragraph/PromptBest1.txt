The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a pivotal process for propene production, characterized by its endothermic nature and the challenges of coking and catalyst deactivation \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. Research efforts have been directed towards optimizing the PDH process to curb cracking and extend catalyst life \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. Small Pt particles have been shown to boost activity but at the cost of selectivity and increased coking \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. Particle size plays a critical role in coking, with smaller particles favoring cracking and larger ones dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. Interestingly, coke formation can paradoxically enhance selectivity by curbing cracking sites \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. 

                    Pt-based catalysts are central to PDH, with coke formation significantly impacting process efficiency \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of promoters and regeneration techniques \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. The addition of Cu to Pt catalysts has been shown to curb coke formation and enhance propene selectivity \[10.1039/c4nr02143f\]. 

                    The PDH process is influenced by temperature and pressure, with Pt and Cr catalysts playing pivotal roles \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. Coke formation on Pt catalysts can be mitigated through the use of promoters and regeneration \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts has been found to extend catalyst life \[10.1002/cctc.202001640\]. 

                    ZrO2 has emerged as a promising catalyst for PDH, outperforming Pt, CrOx, GaOx, and VOx in C-H bond cleavage, enhancing selectivity and mitigating coke formation \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\]. The use of water vapor, facilitated by CeO2, has been shown to significantly reduce coke formation on PtSn catalysts \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. 

                    The PDH process is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, with the oxidation of H2 to H2O breaking this equilibrium \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Metal complex catalysts, notably PtSn and CrOx, are used in commercial processes. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles causes deactivation, which can be mitigated by alloying Pt or using carriers with strong Pt interaction \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts reduces PDH efficiency, necessitating strategies to optimize conditions and improve catalyst composition \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\].

                    ※※※

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalysis, particularly the use of Pt-based catalysts, have significantly enhanced propene production. However, the critical challenge of coke formation remains a hurdle to achieving sustained high efficiency. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel catalysts that inherently resist coking, such as the exploration of single-atom alloys and intermetallics that can maintain high activity and selectivity under PDH conditions \[10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9\]. Additionally, the optimization of reaction conditions, including the precise control of temperature, pressure, and the introduction of steam, could further mitigate coking and improve catalyst longevity \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. The integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and microscopy, could provide deeper insights into the coking mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Moreover, the development of efficient regeneration strategies, such as the use of oxidative techniques and the incorporation of redox-active supports, could significantly enhance the operational stability of PDH catalysts \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\]. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which have shown promise in mitigating coke formation, could also open new avenues for PDH process optimization \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\].

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a pivotal process for propene production, characterized by its endothermic nature and the necessity for high temperatures, which can lead to catalyst deactivation and coke formation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x\]. Pt-based catalysts, despite their high activity, are prone to sintering and coking, which significantly impact the efficiency and longevity of the PDH process \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Particle size is a critical factor, with smaller Pt particles (3nm) exhibiting higher activity but lower selectivity and higher coking rates compared to larger particles (21nm) \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. The balance between CH and CC bond activation is crucial for C3H6 selectivity, with coke formation enhancing selectivity by deactivating CC bond sites \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\].

                    Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of Pt modifiers, such as Sn and alkali metals, weak acidity supports, and hydrogen to suppress coke precursors \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\]. The addition of hydrogen can inhibit coke formation but decreases conversion, while the introduction of water vapor reduces coke but also decreases conversion \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Increasing temperature weakens the effect of water vapor on conversion. Shortening space time reduces coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and inhibits coke formation but cannot be greatly increased. Enhancing coking resistance and optimizing conditions prolong regeneration intervals \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\].

                    Pt/Cu single atom alloys (SAAs) have been shown to mitigate coke formation, enhancing selectivity and stability \[10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8\].

Ceria's redox properties aid in water vapor use, significantly curbing coke formation \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. PtSn catalysts show less than 1wt% coke with vapor, compared to 2.8wt% without, impacting conversion \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. Spent catalysts can regenerate via chlorine-free oxidation \[10.1002/anie.201701115\].

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a pivotal process for propene production, characterized by its endothermic nature and the challenges of thermodynamic equilibrium and coking \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Pt-based catalysts, despite their high activity, are prone to coking, which significantly impacts their efficiency and selectivity \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. Smaller Pt particles (3nm) exhibit higher activity but lower propene selectivity and higher coking rates compared to larger particles (21nm), which favor dehydrogenation over cracking \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. The presence of coke, paradoxically, can act as a promoter by deactivating cracking sites, thus enhancing propene selectivity \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\].

                    Strategies to mitigate coking on Pt-based catalysts include the use of promoters such as Sn, which can extend the catalyst's lifetime \[10.1002/cctc.202001640\], and the implementation of coking-resistant catalysts and regeneration techniques \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. The addition of Cu to Pt-based catalysts can suppress coking, enhancing stability and selectivity \[10.1039/c4nr02143f\]. Moreover, the use of single-atom Pt catalysts on Cu supports and doped graphene can significantly improve selectivity and stability \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03286\].

                    The design of Pt surfaces, alloying with metals like Sn, and the use of supports like CeO2 and dopants can prevent sintering and suppress side reactions, thus reducing coking \[10.1039/d0cs01262a\]. Core-shell catalysts and TiOx supports can also enhance stability and selectivity \[10.1039/d0cs01262a\]. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as hydrogen co-feeding, can suppress coke precursors and reduce deactivation \[10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8\].

                    ZrO2 has emerged as an alternative to Pt-based catalysts, offering enhanced C-H bond cleavage and higher propene selectivity while minimizing coke formation \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\]. Ceria's redox properties aid in the use of water vapor, which can significantly reduce coke formation on PtSn catalysts \[10.1002/anie.201701115\].

                    The industrial application of PDH is driven by the favorable propane-propylene price gap and the demand for pure olefins \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. The use of PtSn catalysts at 1-3 bar and 525-705°C ensures continuous operation and a lifespan of 2-3 years, with temperature adjustments sustaining activity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. However, high temperatures foster coke formation, necessitating frequent regeneration \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    ※※※
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in PDH catalysts and strategies to mitigate coking have opened up new avenues for research and development. Future efforts might focus on the design of novel catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, such as the use of single-atom catalysts and the development of more efficient regeneration techniques. The exploration of alternative catalysts like ZrO2 and the optimization of reaction conditions to further reduce coke formation and improve catalyst performance are promising directions. Additionally, the integration of PDH processes with other chemical processes for the co-production of valuable chemicals could enhance the overall efficiency and economic viability of propene production.
