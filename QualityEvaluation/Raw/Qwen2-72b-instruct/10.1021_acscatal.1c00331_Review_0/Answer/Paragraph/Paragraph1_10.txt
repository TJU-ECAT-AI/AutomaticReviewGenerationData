The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a pivotal process in the petrochemical industry for the production of propene, a key building block in the synthesis of various polymers and chemicals. This process involves the removal of hydrogen from propane, facilitated by a catalyst, to yield propene. Among the catalysts employed, platinum-based (Pt-based) catalysts are particularly effective due to their high activity and selectivity. However, a critical challenge in PDH is the formation of coke, a carbonaceous deposit, on the catalyst surface, which leads to deactivation and reduced efficiency over time. The process characteristics of PDH, including temperature, pressure, and reactant feed rate, significantly influence the rate of coke formation and the overall performance of the Pt-based catalysts. Understanding and mitigating coke formation is crucial for enhancing the longevity and performance of these catalysts, thereby improving the economic viability and sustainability of the PDH process for propene production.
