However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu.

The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.

The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity.

Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.

The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity.

Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.

The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity.

Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.

The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity.

Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8"},
{"Quotes": "", "English": "The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C.

To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process.

The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability.

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst.
