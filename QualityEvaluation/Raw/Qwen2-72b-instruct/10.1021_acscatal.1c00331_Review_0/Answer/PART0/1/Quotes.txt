[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."

          [98] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
          [99] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [100] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [101] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [102] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
          [103] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [104] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [105] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [106] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [107] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [108] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [109] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [110] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [111] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [112] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [113] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [114] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [115] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [116] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [117] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [118] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [119] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [120] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [121] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [122] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [123] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [124] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [125] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [126] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [127] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [128] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [129] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [130] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [131] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [132] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
          [133] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [134] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [135] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [136] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."

          [142] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [143] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [156] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
          [157] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
          [159] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."

[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"

          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."

          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."

          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."

          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH.

The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [22] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [23] "Addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration, providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility, reducing coke deposition and improving catalyst stability. Dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles, prevent their sintering, suppress structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier."



[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
          [2] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."
          [3] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [179] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited,resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [180] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [181] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regen- erations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [182] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [183] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O,the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [184] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [185] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [186] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [187] "Reducing coke forma- tion by increasing the partial pressure of H2 76,77 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [188] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equip- ment investment and operation cost."
          [189] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [190] "Increasing the reac- tion temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conver- sion to some extent."
          [191] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [192] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe opera- tion of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [193] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [194] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity.78"
          [195] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [196] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [197] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [198] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [199] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reac- tions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [200] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [201] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenera- tions is the composition of the catalyst."
          [202] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [203] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycon- densation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [204] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [205] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [206] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."





[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

          [89] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [92] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."

          [104] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [105] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [106] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [107] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [108] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [109] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [110] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [111] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [112] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [113] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [114] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [115] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [116] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [117] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [118] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [119] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [120] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [121] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [122] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [123] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [124] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [125] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [126] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [127] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [128] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [129] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [130] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [131] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [132] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
          [133] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [134] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [135] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [136] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [137] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
          [138] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [139] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [140] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [141] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
          [142] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [143] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [156] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
          [157] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
          [159] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."

          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"

          [44] "The acidity of the carriers can catalyze both the cracking of light alkanes and coking, especially the polycondensation of unsaturated hydrocarbons to form coke."
          [45] "The monometallic Pt can not only promote the formation of coke or coke precursors via deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, but also expedite the cleavage of CC bonds."
          [46] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."

          [60] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [61] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [62] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [63] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."

          [69] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [70] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."

          [81] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [82] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [83] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [84] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."

          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."

          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."

          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."

          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH.

[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
          [2] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."
          [3] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

          [82] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [83] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [84] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."

          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [179] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited,resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [180] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [181] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regen- erations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [182] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [183] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O,the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [184] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [185] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [186] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [187] "Reducing coke forma- tion by increasing the partial pressure of H2 76,77 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [188] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equip- ment investment and operation cost."
          [189] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [190] "Increasing the reac- tion temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conver- sion to some extent."
          [191] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [192] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe opera- tion of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [193] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [194] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity.78"
          [195] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [196] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [197] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [198] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [199] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reac- tions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [200] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [201] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenera- tions is the composition of the catalyst."
          [202] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [203] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycon- densation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [204] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [205] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [206] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."





[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."

          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

          [89] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."

          [108] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [109] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [110] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [111] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [112] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [113] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [114] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [115] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [116] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [117] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [118] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [119] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [120] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [121] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [122] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [123] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [124] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [125] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [126] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [127] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [128] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [129] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [130] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [131] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [132] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
          [133] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [134] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [135] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [136] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [137] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
          [138] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [139] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [140] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [141] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
          [142] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [143] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [156] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
          [157] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
          [159] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"

          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."

          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."

          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."

          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."

          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[1] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
          [2] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

          [83] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [84] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."

          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [179] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited,resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [180] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [181] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regen- erations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [182] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [183] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O,the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [184] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [185] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [186] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [187] "Reducing coke forma- tion by increasing the partial pressure of H2 76,77 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [188] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equip- ment investment and operation cost."
          [189] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [190] "Increasing the reac- tion temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conver- sion to some extent."
          [191] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [192] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe opera- tion of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [193] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [194] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity.78"
          [195] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [196] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [197] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [198] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [199] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reac- tions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [200] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [201] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenera- tions is the composition of the catalyst."
          [202] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [203] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycon- densation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [204] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [205] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [206] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."





[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."

          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."

          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."

          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."

          [113] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [114] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [115] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [116] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [117] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [118] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [119] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [120] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [121] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [122] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [123] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [124] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [125] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [126] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [127] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [128] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [129] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [130] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [131] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [132] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
          [133] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [134] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [135] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [136] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [137] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
          [138] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [139] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [140] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [141] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
          [142] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [143] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [156] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
          [157] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
          [159] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [179] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited,resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [180] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [181] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regen- erations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [182] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
          [10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
          [12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."
          [13] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH."
          [14] "Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium."
          [15] "The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration."
          [16] "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."

On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."



[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
          [2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
          [3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
          [4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
          [5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
          [6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
          [7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
          [8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
          [9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
          [10] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
          [11] "The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
          [12] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
          [13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
          [14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"
          [15] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al."
          [16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
          [17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
          [18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

          [54] "Facilitating the dispersion of Pt."
          [55] "Improving olefin selectivity."
          [56] "Reducing coke formation and slowing down coking deactiva- tion."
          [57] "Increasing sintering resistance."
          [58] "The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn."
          [59] "The addition of B and Si, two nonmetal elements, can play similar roles, too."
          [60] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [61] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."
          [62] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes can be catalyzed by metal complex catalysts and supported metal or metal oxide catalysts."
          [63] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
          [64] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [65] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [66] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [67] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [68] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [69] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [70] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [71] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [72] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [73] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [74] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [75] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [76] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [77] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [78] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [79] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [80] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [81] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [82] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [83] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [84] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [85] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [86] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [87] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."

          [89] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [92] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [93] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."

          [95] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [96] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."

          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."

          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."

          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."

          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
          [2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
          [3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
          [4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
          [5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
          [6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
          [7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
          [8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
          [9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."

          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."



[1] "Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction temperatures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."
          [2] "Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry."
          [3] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production."
          [4] "Severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."
          [5] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation."
          [6] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis."
          [7] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH."
          [8] "Alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability."
          [9] "Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu, respectively."
          [10] "However, it is difficult to apply them to high-temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal stability: Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures."
          [11] "A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds."
          [12] "The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites."
          [13] "Here, the Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt."
          [14] "For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions."
          [15] "Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH."
          [16] "In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact."
          [17] "We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C)."
          [18] "Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature."
          [19] "The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance."
          [20] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
          [21] "PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition."
          [22] "Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity."
          [23] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro- duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C)."
          [24] "PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering."
          [25] "The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h."
          [26] "The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking."
          [27] "This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C."
          [28] "The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem- perature."
          [29] "This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C."
          [30] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."

"Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
          
          "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
          
          "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
          
          "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
          
          "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
          
          "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
          
          "Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
          
          "Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals."



[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
          [2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
          [3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
          [4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
          [6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
          [7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
          [8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
          [9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
          [10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
          [11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
          [12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.
