However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.", "Chinese": "催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，有可能弥补传统裂解器留下的丙烯供应缺口。然而，该过程与主要问题相关，如长链烃的裂解和焦炭形成。裂解降低了所需产品的选择性，而焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。失活的催化剂必须经常再生，而不会失去活性，选择性和稳定性，这增加了过程复杂性和操作成本。已经致力于开发脱氢催化剂的研究，以增加DHP反应的速率，同时减少诸如裂解等不需要的副反应，从而延长催化剂的寿命。较小的颗粒(3 nm)比较大的颗粒(21 nm)更活跃但选择性较差，前者的焦化速率，焦炭形成的选择性和形成的焦炭量明显高于后者。催化剂上Pt粒子的大小可以显著影响焦炭形成的速率，较小的粒子会导致更高的焦炭含量。使用TEOM/GC系统可以从单一催化实验中提供关于活性、选择性和焦炭形成的全面信息。涉及共同表面中间体的反应机制可以作为C3H6脱附，或者进一步裂解为C1、C2，甚至表面碳沉积。小Pt粒子对CC键活化非常活跃，导致裂解反应，而相对较大的Pt粒子对CH键活化更具选择性，导致脱氢反应。C3H6的选择性取决于CH和CC键活化之间的活性比。焦炭可以作为促进剂，通过使CC键活化活性位点失活来提高选择性。在大Pt粒子上，初始C3H6选择性的降低和初始CH4和C2选择性的增加可能是由于Pt粒子中Pt位点的行为在流经时间上的重新排列或修改。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation.

Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢是一种自20世纪80年代以来商业化发展的丙烯生产技术，现在对世界丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。Pt基催化剂是丙烷脱氢中最受欢迎的催化剂，用于商业Oleflex工艺中。然而，这些催化剂会迅速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成，而Pt催化剂上焦炭形成的机制仍然不清楚。理解焦炭形成的机制对于优化反应条件、减少脱氢和再生周期的频率、从而提高丙烯产量至关重要。它还可以帮助合理设计催化剂，以减少焦炭形成速率，同时保持脱氢中的活性和选择性。许多研究人员研究了丙烷脱氢期间Pt或改性Pt催化剂上的焦炭形成，大多数研究旨在通过用Sn或碱金属改性Pt或使用不同的催化剂载体来降低焦炭形成速率。碱金属，如锂、钠和钾，已被证明通过向Pt催化剂提供过量的可移动电子来降低焦炭形成速率。使用弱酸性载体，如SBA-15，也可以通过减弱丙烯吸附和抑制丙烯脱氢或聚合来减少焦炭的形成。焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作条件。研究表明，氢气可以减少焦炭形成速率和催化剂失活速率，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，但不能去除已经形成在催化剂上的焦炭。焦炭形成是一个结构敏感的反应，氢气可以降低焦炭形成速率和焦炭形成的失活效应。", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8"},

However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content.

Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%.

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯是工业上常见的过程，通常使用铂(Pt)作为催化剂。反应遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于形成CH3CC*和C*，导致裂解和最终焦炭形成。小Pt簇上的较高焦炭形成率是由于较大的Pt表面积，导致更快的失活。合理构建Pt表面结构可以提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成。丙烯被鉴定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs01262a"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%.

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯是工业上常见的过程，通常使用铂(Pt)作为催化剂。反应遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于形成CH3CC*和C*，导致裂解和最终焦炭形成。小Pt簇上的较高焦炭形成率是由于较大的Pt表面积，导致更快的失活。合理构建Pt表面结构可以提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成。丙烯被鉴定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs01262a"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%.

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯是工业上常见的过程，通常使用铂(Pt)作为催化剂。反应遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于形成CH3CC*和C*，导致裂解和最终焦炭形成。小Pt簇上的较高焦炭形成率是由于较大的Pt表面积，导致更快的失活。合理构建Pt表面结构可以提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成。丙烯被鉴定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs01262a"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%.

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯是工业上常见的过程，通常使用铂(Pt)作为催化剂。反应遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于形成CH3CC*和C*，导致裂解和最终焦炭形成。小Pt簇上的较高焦炭形成率是由于较大的Pt表面积，导致更快的失活。合理构建Pt表面结构可以提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成。丙烯被鉴定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs01262a"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。\n          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs00983k"},

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%.

Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst.

The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯是工业上常见的过程，通常使用铂(Pt)作为催化剂。反应遵循逆Horiuti-Polanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于形成CH3CC*和C*，导致裂解和最终焦炭形成。小Pt簇上的较高焦炭形成率是由于较大的Pt表面积，导致更快的失活。合理构建Pt表面结构可以提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成。丙烯被鉴定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。", "Doi": "10.1039/d0cs01262a"},

The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency.

and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.\n          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop.

However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法,需要高温反应以获得足够的产量。然而,这可能导致显著的催化剂失活,因为焦炭的形成。开发在高温下不发生失活的高稳定性PDH催化剂对工业具有极大的兴趣和益处。使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料的催化丙烷脱氢是满足全球丙烯生产日益增长需求的有前途的技术。在高温条件下,由于焦炭沉积和/或烧结,严重的催化剂失活是不可避免的,因此在实际使用中,催化剂必须连续或在短时间内再生。PDH中的选择性和稳定性由产品丙烯是否脱附或经历不希望的副反应之间的平衡决定,如进一步的CH(C)裂解和随后的焦炭形成。基于Pt的催化剂,特别是PtPt集合体,已知对丙烯过度脱氢和其氢解具有活性。隔离Pt原子是抑制PDH中不希望的副反应的有希望的策略。将活性主金属(主要是Pt)与某些惰性金属(主要是典型元素如Sn)合金化一直是稀释PtPt集合体和增强丙烯选择性和稳定性的传统方法。单原子和单原子合金催化剂是使用隔离Pt的有效工具,其中活性金属在氧化物支撑上原子分散,并由过量的11族金属如Cu隔离。然而,将这些催化剂应用于像PDH这样的高温反应是具有挑战性的,因为Pt原子或没有空间分离的合金纳米颗粒在非常高的温度下容易聚集形成更大的纳米颗粒,由于其热稳定性不足。可能的解决方案是使用包含在热稳定金属间化合物中的类似单原子的隔离Pt。PtGa的稳定(111)表面有四种不同的终止,显示孤立和三重Pt和Ga位点。Ga3基团可以被视为支持孤立Pt1原子的基质;因此,可能将Pt1位点描述为单原子Pt。然而,对于PDH中的PtGa,预计Pt3位点对进一步的CH(C)裂解更活跃。因此,需要一些修改,使仅Pt3位点失效,而Pt1位点可用于反应,以实现高选择性和稳定的PDH。在本研究中,我们设计了Pb改性的PtGa,其中三重Pt被Pb沉积选择性地阻塞,而单原子Pt保持完整。我们通过浸渍方法制备了SiO2支撑的PtGa和PtGaPb(Pt/Pb = 2)催化剂(在700°C下用H2还原),并在高温(600或650°C)下测试PDH。在这里,我们展示了一种不同类型的单原子Pt及其在高温PDH中出色的催化性能。PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下96小时内表现出30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性,而性能没有下降。单原子Pt很好地催化了第一次和第二次CH活化,同时有效地抑制了第三次,这最小化了副反应到焦炭,并极大地提高了选择性和稳定性。即使在恶劣条件下,PtGaPb也保持了高转化率和优异的选择性(>30% conv., >99.6% sel.)长达50小时。因此,Pb对PtGa的改性显著提高了稳定性和选择性。我们在高温下(>580°C)实现了长期、连续和高选择性的丙烯生产,而不会失活。PtGaPb保留了其小颗粒尺寸(新鲜:2.8±0.6nm,使用后:3.0±0.6nm)、间金属结构和元素分布,证明了其高热稳定性和对烧结的抵抗力。在650°C下也进行了稳定性测试,其中PtGaPb在几小时内保持高转化率(37-38%),然后在50小时内逐渐降低到大约20%。逐渐失活可归因于热(非催化)裂解的贡献。这通过使用SiO2的对照实验得到证实,其中在650°C下形成了少量的C1和C2,而在600°C下则可以忽略不计。间金属PtGa和Pb改性的结合适合于在高温下稳定类似单原子的隔离Pt。这可能是因为(1)PtGa本身热力学稳定(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1)和(2)Pb的原子半径(1.80 Å)远大于Pt(1.35 Å)和Ga(1.30 Å)的原子半径:即使在600°C下,Pb向PtGa体内的扩散也不太可能有利。Pt1位点的高丙烯选择性最小化了焦炭的积累,这导致了出色的催化剂稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9"},

{"Quotes": "", "English": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03286"},
