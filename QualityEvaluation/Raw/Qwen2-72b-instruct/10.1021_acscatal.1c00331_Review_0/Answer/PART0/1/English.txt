The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with higher resistance to coking.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress coking and maintain activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with high resistance to coking. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by removing hydrogen from propane. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the selectivity and activity of the reaction. Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for PDH, but they are susceptible to coke formation, which can deactivate the catalyst and reduce process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using promoters, such as phosphate, to stabilize the catalyst surface and prevent the accumulation of coke. Catalyst regeneration can also be implemented to restore the activity of the deactivated catalyst. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with higher resistance to coking.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using promoters, such as phosphate, to stabilize the catalyst surface and prevent the accumulation of coke. Catalyst regeneration can also be implemented to restore the activity of the deactivated catalyst. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with higher resistance to coking.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH.

Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with higher resistance to coking.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propene is a common industrial process that typically uses platinum (Pt) as a catalyst. The reaction follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, leading to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, resulting in faster deactivation. The rational construction of a Pt surface structure can improve catalytic selectivity and control coke formation. Propylene is identified as a precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor. To increase the selectivity toward propylene, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports. The addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposition and improve the catalyst stability. The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier. Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals. The coreshell catalysts have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene. The catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, consistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al. The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts. Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH. The electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species increases the electron density of Pt, which can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process for producing propene, but it is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically viable yields. High temperatures can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The redox properties of ceria (CeO2) allow the use of water vapor, which can almost completely eliminate coke deposition during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures. The spent PtSn catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed to the catalyst. Without water vapor, the coke content increases from 0.5 to 2.8wt%, and the conversion drops. The spent catalyst readily reverts to an atomically dispersed state after oxidation treatment without the need for added chlorine.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream. The regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved through successive oxidation-reduction cycles, which can largely restore the initial activity of the catalyst.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propylene, which requires high reaction temperatures to achieve sufficient yields. However, this can lead to significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH that do not deactivate even at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising technique to meet the increasing global demand for propylene production. Under high-temperature conditions, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable, requiring continuous or short-cycle regeneration of the catalysts in practical use. Selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and subsequent coke formation. Pt-based catalysts, particularly PtPt ensembles, are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. Isolating Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit undesired side reactions in PDH. Alloying active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability. Single-atom and single-atom alloy catalysts are effective tools for using isolated Pt, where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support and isolated by excess amounts of 11 group metals like Cu. However, applying these catalysts to high-temperature reactions like PDH is challenging due to insufficient thermal stability, as Pt atoms or alloy nanoparticles without spatial separation can easily aggregate to form larger nanoparticles at very high temperatures. A possible solution to this challenge is the use of single-atom-like isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds. The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga sites. The Ga3 moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1 atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as single-atom Pt. For PtGa in PDH, however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH. In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt remains intact. We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) catalysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 °C) and test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 °C). Here, we show a different type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic performance in PDH at high temperature. The PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability. PtGaPb retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv., >99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580 C). PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes (flesh: 2.8 ± 0.6 nm, spent: 3.0 ± 0.6 nm), intermetallic structure, and elemental distribution, demonstrating the high thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at 650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (37-38%) for several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20% over 50 h. The gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of thermal (noncatalytic) cracking. This was confirmed by a control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C. The combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high temperature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermodynamically stable (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol-1) and (2) the atomic radius of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt (1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction is strongly endothermic, with heat provided by the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.

          Key considerations for reaction conditions include high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, typically above 600°C for light paraffins. However, higher temperatures also accelerate side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

          Catalyst types have evolved from chromia-alumina to noble metal catalysts, particularly platinum-based catalysts. The introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology in the 1970s by UOP allowed for stable catalyst activity over several years without reactor shutdowns.

          Industrial applications of PDH include the production of light olefins, particularly propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include using platinum modifiers to selectively weaken platinum-olefin interactions, improving stability against fouling, and controlling catalyst support acidity with alkali or alkaline earth metals. The use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR technology also helps maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions very favorable.
          Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years, with dozens of new installations already under construction worldwide.
          The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States.
          The high-energy demands of traditional processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.
