          [68] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [69] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [70] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [71] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited, resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."

          [73] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [74] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [75] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2, H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [76] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [77] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [78] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [79] "Reducing coke formation by increasing the partial pressure of H2 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [80] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equipment investment and operation cost."
          [81] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [82] "Increasing the reaction temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conversion to some extent."
          [83] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [84] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe operation of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [85] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [86] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity."
          [87] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [88] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [89] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [90] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [91] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reactions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [92] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [93] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenerations is the composition of the catalyst."
          [94] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [95] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycondensation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [96] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [97] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [98] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."
          [99] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic,and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermo- dynamic equilibrium."
          [100] "If the H2 produced can be oxidized to H2O during dehydrogenation, not only will the endothermic process be transformed to an exothermic one, but also the equilibrium limitation will be broken."

          [142] "Although supported Pt catalysts have been applied commercially for several decades, it is still a research hotspot."
          [143] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [144] "The increase of metal particle size and the decrease of carrier surface at high temperature are all called sintering."
          [145] "Sintering reduces the surface area of the active phase,and consequently decreases the catalytic activity."
          [146] "The permanent deactivation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the sintering of Pt nano- particles."
          [147] "If no measures are taken to redisperse Pt particles,the effect of the reduction of the carrier surface on the activity will be negligible."
          [148] "Sintering is a thermally activated process and high tempera- ture is the driving force."
          [149] "These exposed Pt nano-particles are not stable under the reaction conditions and part of the particles migrate and coalesce to form larger Pt particles."
          [150] "It seems that it is impossible to prevent the sintering of Pt nano- particles; some measures, however, can be taken to retard the process."
          [151] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles."
          [152] "The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."
          [153] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong inter- action with Pt is another way to retard the sintering."
          [154] "Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."
          [155] "Nanocarbon was also reported as the carrier of Pt to improve the sintering resistance, and the strong metalcarrier interaction leads to the electron transfer from nanocarbon to the Pt particles, signifi- cantly preventing the sintering of Pt."
          [156] "MgAl2O4 spinel is also a good choice as the carrier."
          [157] "In this way, Pt particles isolated are not easy to migrate into large ones."
          [158] "The introduction of a second metal or the choice of an appropriate carrier only slows down the sintering rate of Pt."
          [159] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
          [160] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles."
          [161] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redis- perse sintered Pt particles."
          [162] "Although there are many negative effects for the introduction of chlorine into the units, it has to be adopted since there is no other good approach that can be chosen."
          [163] "Compared with a dehydrogenation catalyst, solving the problem of Pt sintering is more urgent for an automotive exhaust catalyst, because the latter is required to work for a long time at higher temperature and cannot be redispersed in situ."
          [164] "Tanabe et al. revealed that no Pt sintering was observed for Pt/MgO as an automotive exhaust catalyst after calcination in air at 900 1C, for the formation of a Mg2PtO4-like compound prevents the migration of Pt."
          [165] "Nagai et al. found that CeO2 had a similar effect of MgO in preventing the sintering of Pt due to the formation of the PtOCe bond in the Pt/CeO2 catalyst."
          [166] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."
          [167] "The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."
          [168] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 1C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons."
          [169] "The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [170] "What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."
          [171] "Obviously, to regenerate the Pt catalyst in the absence of a halide is great progress."
          [172] "The time between regenerations is an important parameter for the design and operation of fixed- or moving-bed reactors."
          [173] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."
          [174] "Coking deactiva- tion is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."
          [175] "The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
          [176] "If the coke is formed on the carriers, the activity of the catalyst will not be affected, while the pressure drop of the catalyst bed will increase consequently."
          [177] "It should be noticed that both the conversion and the selectivity will decrease with the increase of the pressure drop."
          [178] "The conversion will decrease since dehydrogenation is a reversible reaction with an increase in the mole number."
          [179] "As for the selectivity to olefins, since the side reactions such as cracking and coking are irreversible reactions, the proportion of the side reactions will increase when dehydrogenation is inhibited,resulting in the reduced olefin selectivity."
          [180] "Only when the Pt particles are covered by coke will the catalyst deactivate."
          [181] "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regen- erations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation."
          [182] "Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst."
          [183] "For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O,the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor."
          [184] "For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition."
          [185] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation."
          [186] "In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."
          [187] "Reducing coke forma- tion by increasing the partial pressure of H2 76,77 is at the cost of the conversion of light alkanes, since it is thermodynamically unfavorable for dehydrogenation."
          [188] "The circulation of H2 and the decrease of the conversion will lead to the increase of equip- ment investment and operation cost."
          [189] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."
          [190] "Increasing the reac- tion temperature will weaken the effect of H2O on the conver- sion to some extent."
          [191] "For example, when adding a little H2O into the feed, the conversion of propane over the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst reaches about 40% at 680 1C and coke formation is almost suppressed completely from 2.8 to 0.5 wt%."
          [192] "As for the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, it should be kept as low as possible without affecting the stable and safe opera- tion of the unit, because the conversion will drop and the coke yield will increase with the pressure."
          [193] "Generally, adjusting the partial pressure of hydrocarbons to reduce coke formation is not considered in practice."
          [194] "Space time affects both the conversion and the selectivity.78"
          [195] "The conversion increases with it and the selectivity is just the opposite."
          [196] "The increased formation of side products include coke and the smaller molecules produced by cracking."
          [197] "Although shortening the space time can reduce or even almost avoid coke formation, what is more important is the balance between the conversion and the selectivity."
          [198] "The effect of the linear velocity on coking is similar to that of the space time."
          [199] "In the case of a constant space time, the increase of the linear velocity is unfavorable for the adsorption of the formed olefins on the catalyst surface and reduces the backmixing degree of oil vapor, and thus the secondary reac- tions of olefins, including the polycondensation to coke, can be inhibited even though the linear velocity cannot be elevated greatly due to the consequently increased pressure drop of the catalyst bed, which is proportional to the square of velocity."
          [200] "Therefore, this measure is not applicable to lengthen the time between regenerations."
          [201] "The most important factor affecting the time between regenera- tions is the composition of the catalyst."
          [202] "Both the metals and the carriers may catalyze the formation of coke, as stated in the section of side reactions and selectivity."
          [203] "The addition of the second metal to form alloys with Pt and using the carrier without acidity can reduce the coke formed by deep dehydrogenation and polycon- densation of hydrocarbons, respectively."
          [204] "Jiang et al. suggested that adding about 10 wt% TiO2 into Al2O3 carrier can suppress coke formation, because the electron donation from partially reduced TiOx species to Pt leads to electron-rich Pt particles, which inhibit the adsorption of propylene and the formation of the coke precursor."
          [205] "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."
          [206] "Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process that converts propane to propene and hydrogen. The single-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. If hydrogen can be oxidized to water during dehydrogenation, the endothermic process becomes exothermic, and the equilibrium limitation is broken. PDH is catalyzed by metal complex catalysts or supported metal/metal oxide catalysts. Commercial PDH processes use supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Supported Pt catalysts have been used for decades but are still a research hotspot. Sintering of Pt nanoparticles is a major cause of permanent deactivation. Sintering resistance can be improved by adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt or using carriers with strong interaction with Pt, such as Al2O3, nanocarbon, or MgAl2O4 spinel. Sintering is a thermally activated process that causes Pt nanoparticles to migrate and coalesce into larger particles. Preventing sintering completely is difficult, but measures can be taken to slow it down. Regeneration of sintered Pt catalysts requires redispersion of Pt particles, which is typically achieved by air regeneration in the presence of a halide like chlorine. However, chlorine introduction has negative effects and is not always feasible. Solving Pt sintering is more urgent for automotive exhaust catalysts due to their higher temperature requirements and lack of in-situ redispersion. Pt/MgO and Pt/CeO2 catalysts have shown resistance to sintering due to the formation of stable compounds that prevent Pt migration. Pt supported on CeO2 can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, which is stable even at high temperatures. Adding Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be fully regenerated by burning coke without oxychlorination, which is a significant progress.
          Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts PDH process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke formation is classified into quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity is not simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited. Coke formed on carriers does not affect catalyst activity but increases pressure drop, which decreases conversion and selectivity. Only when Pt particles are covered by coke does the catalyst deactivate. Slowing down coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are crucial for improving PDH technologies. Measures to slow down coking rate include optimizing reaction conditions (increasing H2 partial pressure, introducing H2O, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, shortening space time, increasing linear velocity) and improving catalyst composition (adding second metal, using non-acidic carrier). Increasing H2 partial pressure inhibits coke formation but decreases conversion. Introducing H2O reduces coke but decreases conversion due to competitive adsorption. Increasing reaction temperature weakens H2O's effect on conversion. Reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure is not practical. Shortening space time can reduce coke but must balance conversion and selectivity. Increasing linear velocity reduces olefin adsorption and backmixing, inhibiting secondary reactions like coke formation, but cannot be greatly increased due to increased pressure drop. The most effective way to prolong time between regenerations is improving catalyst coking resistance. Optimizing reaction conditions (introducing hydrogen or steam) can also help lengthen time between regenerations.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。单程转化率受热力学平衡的限制。如果在脱氢过程中氢气可以被氧化为水，不仅吸热过程会变成放热过程，而且平衡限制也会被打破。PDH可以通过金属复合催化剂或支持金属/金属氧化物催化剂催化。商业PDH工艺使用支持的PtSn或CrOx催化剂。支持的Pt催化剂已经使用了几十年，但仍然是研究热点。Pt纳米粒子的烧结是永久失活的主要原因。可以通过添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金或使用与Pt有强相互作用的载体(如Al2O3、纳米碳或MgAl2O4尖晶石)来改善Pt的烧结抗性。烧结是一个热激活过程，导致Pt纳米粒子迁移和聚结成更大的粒子。完全防止烧结是困难的，但可以采取措施来减缓它。烧结Pt催化剂的再生需要Pt粒子的再分散，这通常通过在卤素(如氯)存在下通过空气再生来实现。然而，卤素的引入有负面影响，并不总是可行的。对于汽车尾气催化剂来说，解决Pt烧结问题更为紧迫，因为它们需要更高的温度要求，而且缺乏原位再分散。Pt/MgO和Pt/CeO2催化剂由于形成稳定的化合物，防止Pt迁移，显示出对烧结的抗性。支持在CeO2上的Pt可以将Pt捕获在原子分散的状态，即使在高温下也很稳定。添加Sn形成小的PtSn簇，结果是一个高度选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。失活的PtSn/CeO2催化剂可以通过燃烧焦炭而不进行氧氯化来完全再生，这是一个重大进展。
          Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成影响PDH工艺效率，降低催化剂活性和选择性。焦炭形成分为快速失活和稳态。失活的程度与沉积的焦炭量和性质并不简单相关。在载体上形成的焦炭不会影响催化剂的活性，但会增加催化剂床的压力降，从而降低转化率和选择性。只有当Pt粒子被焦炭覆盖时，催化剂才会失活。减缓焦炭形成速率和延长再生时间对于改善PDH技术至关重要。减缓焦炭形成速率的措施包括优化反应条件(增加H2分压、引入H2O、降低烃类分压、缩短空时、增加线速度)和改善催化剂组成(添加第二种金属、使用非酸性载体)。增加H2分压可以抑制焦炭形成，但会降低转化率。引入H2O会减少焦炭，但由于竞争吸附，会降低转化率。增加反应温度会削弱H2O对转化的影响。降低烃类分压在实践中是不可行的。缩短空时可以减少焦炭，但必须在转化率和选择性之间取得平衡。增加线速度会减少烯烃的吸附和返混，抑制二次反应，如焦炭形成，但由于压力降的增加，不能大大增加。延长再生时间最有效的方法是提高催化剂的焦炭抗性。优化反应条件(引入氢气或蒸汽)也可以帮助延长再生时间。
