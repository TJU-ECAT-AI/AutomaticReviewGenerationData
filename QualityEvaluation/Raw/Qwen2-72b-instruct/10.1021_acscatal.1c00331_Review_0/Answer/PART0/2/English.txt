PDH is a method for propene production that can help make up for the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers. The key considerations for PDH include the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation, which can reduce product selectivity and cause catalyst deactivation. Catalyst regeneration is necessary to maintain activity, selectivity, and stability, but this increases process complexity and operation costs. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the desired product selectivity and causing deactivation of the catalyst. The rate of coking is significantly higher on catalysts with smaller Pt particles, leading to a higher coke content. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking. Small Pt particles are very active for cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for dehydrogenation reactions.
