[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[7] "The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke."
[8] "Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity."
[9] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support."
[10] "The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[11] "At the same time, CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species."
[12] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[13] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[14] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[15] "Some of these catalysts were found to achieve ethane conversions of 2730% and selectivity toward ethylene of 7175%."
[16] "The method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors was found to determine several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, such as surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is driven by the favorable market conditions due to the price difference between propane and propylene. This process is advantageous because it is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propene, rather than a mixture of products. Industrial PDH processes are optimized to produce polymer-quality olefins. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, with many new installations already under construction worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane. The petrochemical industry is searching for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies due to the high-energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices of traditional processes. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields in PDH also promote the formation of coke, which leads to the progressive deterioration of catalyst performance over time. Catalysts need to be regenerated frequently to maintain sufficient activity. The addition of alkaline metals to the catalyst support can suppress coke formation. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant can improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium toward product formation. CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species. The use of silica as a support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Titania does not make a good support because CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2. CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, achieving ethane conversions of 2730% and selectivity toward ethylene of 7175%. The method of introducing Cr into the LDH precursors determines several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, including surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，其市场条件非常有利，因为丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异决定了PDH的盈利能力。该过程的优势在于它是一种特定目的的技术，仅产生特定的烯烃，即丙烯，而不是混合产品。工业PDH过程被优化以生产聚合物级的烯烃。预计未来几年PDH装置的数量将大幅增加，许多新的PDH装置已经在世界各地建设中。由于相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，美国的蒸汽裂解装置从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷。由于传统过程的高能耗需求、低选择性、石油储备的减少和油价上涨，石化行业正在寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。PDH中高烯烃产率所需的高温也促进了焦炭的形成，导致催化剂性能随时间逐渐下降。为了保持足够的活性，催化剂需要频繁再生。在催化剂载体中添加碱金属可以抑制焦炭的形成。二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，可以通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除产生的氢气，从而提高铬脱氢催化剂的活性，有效地将平衡向产物形成的方向移动。二氧化碳对催化活性Cr3+物种氧化为非活性Cr5+或Cr6+物种无效。在基于铬的脱氢催化剂中使用二氧化硅作为载体需要相对高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。由于CrOx与TiO2的弱相互作用，二氧化钛不是一个好的载体，因为CrOx容易烧结。使用层状双氢氧化物(LDH)前体制备的CrMgAl和CrMg混合氧化物已被研究作为非氧化脱氢乙烯的催化剂，实现了2730%的乙烷转化率和7175%的乙烯选择性。将Cr引入LDH前体的方法决定了所得混合氧化物的几个性质，如表面积、催化性能、焦炭抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。
