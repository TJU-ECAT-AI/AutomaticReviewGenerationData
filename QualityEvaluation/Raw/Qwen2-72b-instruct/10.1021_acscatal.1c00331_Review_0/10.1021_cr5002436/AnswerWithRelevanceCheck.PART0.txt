          The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable.
          An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products.
          Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity.
          However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction.
          The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
          The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies.
          The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.
          The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span.
          The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C.
          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke.
          Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity.

          The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products.
          The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
          The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which impacts the process efficiency.
          Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of selective hydrogen combustion, the addition of a solid oxygen carrier, and the use of a membrane permeable to hydrogen.
