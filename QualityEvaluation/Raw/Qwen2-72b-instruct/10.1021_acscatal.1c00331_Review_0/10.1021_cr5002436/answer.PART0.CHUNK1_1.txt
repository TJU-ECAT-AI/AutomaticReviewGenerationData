[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention."
[2] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[3] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[4] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[5] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."
[6] "The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites."
[7] "The addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

[10] "The addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide, can improve the performance of supported vanadium catalysts."
[11] "The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."

[13] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the direct conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction is endothermic and is typically carried out at high temperatures (around 600°C) and low pressures. The key considerations for PDH include the choice of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the management of coke formation.
2.Catalysts used in PDH include platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, chromium oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts, and gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts. Pt-based catalysts are highly active and stable, but are expensive due to the use of noble metals. CrOx-based catalysts are less expensive but deactivate faster due to coke formation. GaOx-based catalysts have shown promise due to their high activity and stability, but their exact nature of active sites is still under debate.
3.Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other petrochemical products. The process is widely used due to its high efficiency and selectivity for propene production.
4.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major issue in PDH as it leads to a decrease in catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke is formed through the polymerization of hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface, which blocks active sites and hinders the diffusion of reactants. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of steam or hydrogen in the feed to promote coke removal, the addition of promoters such as tin (Sn) to the catalyst to improve its stability, and the use of supports with low acidity to reduce coke formation.
5.Catalyst regeneration is an important aspect of PDH to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity. Regeneration involves the removal of coke from the catalyst surface through combustion with an oxygen-containing gas. The regeneration process must be carefully controlled to prevent over-oxidation of the catalyst and to maintain its activity and selectivity.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，它通过去除氢原子将丙烷直接转化为丙烯。该反应是吸热的，通常在高温(约600°C)和低压下进行。PDH的关键考虑因素包括催化剂的选择、反应条件和焦炭形成的管理。
2.PDH中使用的催化剂包括铂(Pt)基催化剂、铬氧化物(CrOx)基催化剂和镓氧化物(GaOx)基催化剂。Pt基催化剂活性高、稳定性好，但由于使用贵金属而成本高昂。CrOx基催化剂成本较低，但由于焦炭形成而失活速度较快。GaOx基催化剂由于其高活性和稳定性而显示出前景，但其活性位点的确切性质仍在争论中。
3.PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯用于制造塑料、树脂和其他石化产品。由于其高效率和丙烯生产的高选择性，该过程被广泛使用。
4.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成是PDH中的一个主要问题，因为它会导致催化剂活性和选择性的下降。焦炭是通过催化剂表面的烃类聚合形成的，它堵塞活性位点，阻碍反应物的扩散。减少焦炭形成的策略包括在进料中使用蒸汽或氢气以促进焦炭去除，向催化剂中添加锡(Sn)等促进剂以提高其稳定性，以及使用低酸度的载体以减少焦炭形成。
5.催化剂再生是PDH中维持催化剂活性和选择性的重要方面。再生涉及通过与含氧气体的燃烧从催化剂表面去除焦炭。必须仔细控制再生过程，以防止催化剂的过度氧化，并保持其活性和选择性。
