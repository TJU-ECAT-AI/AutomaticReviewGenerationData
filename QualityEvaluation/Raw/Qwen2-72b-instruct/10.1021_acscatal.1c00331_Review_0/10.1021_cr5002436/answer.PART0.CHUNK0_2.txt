1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene by directly removing hydrogen from propane. The efficiency of this process is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions very favorable. PDH is advantageous because it is a purpose-built technique that produces a specific olefin rather than a mixture of products. Industrial PDH processes are optimized to produce polymer-grade purity olefins. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, with many already under construction worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States is due to the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane. The petrochemical industry is driven to find more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies due to the high energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices of traditional processes.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the efficiency of the PDH process by causing a progressive loss of catalyst activity over time. This necessitates frequent regeneration of the catalysts to maintain sufficient activity. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for coke formation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include controlling the temperature and pressure, using selective hydrogen combustion to remove hydrogen and shift the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields, and using a membrane permeable to hydrogen to withdraw hydrogen from the system. However, the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, making this approach more suitable for the dehydrogenation of isobutene.
3.The Catofin process uses a chromia-alumina catalyst in a fixed bed reactor, with the reaction run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, with the progressive loss in activity counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to maintain a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst life span. The Oleflex process uses a PtSn-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor, with the reaction run at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是通过直接从丙烷中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。该过程的效率在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。PDH的优势在于它是一种专门的技术，仅产生特定的烯烃，而不是产品混合物。工业PDH过程经过优化，可以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。预计未来几年PDH装置的数量将大幅增加，全球已宣布数十个新的PDH装置，其中许多装置已经在建设中。美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置，是由于相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性。由于传统过程的高能需求、低选择性、石油储备的减少和油价上涨，石化行业正在寻求更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。
2.在Pt基催化剂上形成焦炭会影响PDH过程的效率，导致催化剂活性随时间逐渐下降。这需要频繁地再生催化剂，以保持足够的活性。获得高烯烃产量所需的高温也是焦炭形成的最佳条件。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括控制温度和压力，使用选择性氢燃烧去除氢气，将平衡向更高的烯烃产量转移，以及使用对氢气渗透的膜从系统中提取氢气。然而，这些膜的热稳定性有限，这使得这种方法更适合于异丁烯的脱氢。
3.Catofin工艺使用铬酸铝催化剂在固定床反应器中，反应在约575 C的温度和0.2至0.5 bar的压力下进行。脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热含量，由于反应的吸热性质，热含量迅速下降。催化剂可使用2-3年，随着时间的推移，活性的逐渐下降通过逐渐提高温度来抵消，以在整个催化剂寿命期间保持恒定的脱氢活性。Oleflex工艺使用PtSn基催化剂在流化床反应器中，反应在1至3 bar的压力和525至705 C的温度范围内进行。整个系统设计为连续运行，以获得连续的反应产物流。再生催化剂被重新引入到第一个反应器中，每5-10天完成一个完整的循环。
