[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[7] "The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction."
[8] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[9] "The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar."
[10] "The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[11] "The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products."
[12] "The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days."
[13] "The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke."
[14] "Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity."
[15] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support."
[16] "The authors propose that the strength of the Ptsupport interaction depends on the strength of the PtOM bond (where M represents the cation in the support), which in turn shows an excellent correlation with the electron density of the oxygen in the support."
[17] "However, Pt can be redispersed on the catalyst by the addition of low amounts of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at temperatures around 500 C, although this process can only occur when the interaction between the support and the PtOx and PtOxCly species formed is such that mobile surface complexes are produced."
[18] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support."
[19] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[20] "These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."
[21] "The use of more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, because the latter have considerably less Brnsted acid sites relative to γ-alumina, albeit they also tend to have considerably lower surface areas."
[22] "Indeed, by hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination."
[23] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[24] "Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[25] "The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides."
[26] "However, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[27] "Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation."
[28] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[29] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[30] "CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane."
[31] "Some of these catalysts were found to achieve ethane conversions of 2730% and selectivity toward ethylene of 7175%."
[32] "The method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors was found to determine several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, such as surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering."
[33] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[34] "This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[35] "Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene, which is a key chemical building block used in the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable for this process. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propene, rather than a mixture of products, and industrial processes are optimized to produce polymer-quality purity olefins. The demand for propene is increasing, leading to the construction of dozens of new PDH installations worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States is due to the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids. The high-energy demands and low selectivity of traditional processes, combined with dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices, are driving the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies.
2.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures, typically around 575°C, and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. The Catofin process, which is one of the most widely used PDH processes, employs a chromia-alumina catalyst and operates in a fixed-bed reactor with alternating dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to maintain a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span. The Oleflex process, another widely used PDH process, uses a PtSn-based catalyst and operates in a fluidized bed reactor with continuous catalyst regeneration. The reaction is run at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705°C. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products, and the regenerated catalyst is reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.
3.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the efficiency of the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) process by causing a progressive loss in activity over time. The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, leading to the progressive deterioration of dehydrogenation catalysts with time-on-stream. To preserve sufficient activity, it is necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, which poison acid sites on the support, suppressing the formation of coke. Zn and Mg can also be used to dope the support, resulting in a less acidic and thermally more stable spinel phase that curtails the sintering of platinum. The use of more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, can also help prevent coke formation. Hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation can result in better Pt dispersion and reduce coke formation. The use of zirconia as an alternative support offers the advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides, but Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts, partially due to the higher coking rate. XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and cause catalyst deactivation. CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, and the method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors determines several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, including surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering.
4.Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This promotion effect is attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites. The presence of alkali metal promoters also increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation of Cr6+ complexes under oxidizing conditions that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere. However, doping with K+ can result in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity for some materials, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, gallium-chromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia. This is believed to be due to potassium forming bonds with oxygen anions, altering their properties and hindering catalysis.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，丙烯是一种关键的化学中间体，用于生产各种化学品，包括聚合物、氧合物和化学中间体。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件对这一过程非常有利。PDH是一种有目的的技术，它产生特定的烯烃，丙烯，而不是混合产品，工业过程被优化以生产聚合物质量纯度的烯烃。对丙烯的需求正在增加，导致全球范围内数十个新的PDH装置的建设。从石油基萘到美国页岩乙烷的蒸汽裂解装置的转变是由于相对便宜的天然气液体的高可用性。传统工艺的高能耗和低选择性，加上石油储量的减少和油价的上涨，正在推动石化行业寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。
2.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种吸热反应，需要大约575°C的高温和0.2至0.5巴的压力。Catofin工艺是最广泛使用的PDH工艺之一，它使用铬铝催化剂，在固定床反应器中运行，具有交替的脱氢、再生和冲洗步骤。脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热含量，由于反应的吸热性质，热含量迅速下降。催化剂可使用2-3年，随着时间的推移，活性逐渐下降，通过逐渐提高温度来抵消，以在整个催化剂寿命期间保持恒定的脱氢活性。Oleflex工艺是另一种广泛使用的PDH工艺，它使用PtSn基催化剂，在流化床反应器中运行，具有连续的催化剂再生。反应在1至3巴的压力下进行，温度范围为525至705°C。整个系统被设计为连续运行，以获得连续的反应产物流，再生催化剂被重新引入到第一个反应器，每5-10天完成一个完整的循环。
3.在Pt基催化剂上形成焦炭会影响催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)过程的效率，随着时间的推移，活性逐渐下降。为了获得高烯烃产量所需的高温也是焦炭形成的最佳条件，导致脱氢催化剂随着时间的推移而逐渐恶化。为了保持足够的活性，必须频繁地再生催化剂。减少焦炭形成的策略包括添加碱金属，如Li、Na和K，这些金属会毒化支撑上的酸位点，抑制焦炭的形成。Zn和Mg也可以用来掺杂支撑，形成酸性较低、热稳定性较高的尖晶石相，从而抑制铂的烧结。使用更稳定的氧化铝多晶型物，如θ-或α-氧化铝，也可以帮助防止焦炭的形成。在γ-Al2O3浸渍前进行水热处理可以产生更好的Pt分散性，减少焦炭的形成。使用氧化锆作为替代支撑提供了防止形成CrAl混合氧化物的优势，但Cr2O3/ZrO2的失活速度比其他活性较低的催化剂快，部分原因是焦炭率较高。XPS研究表明，铬氧化锆催化剂有利于形成铬碳化物，这些碳化物在脱氢中不活跃，导致催化剂失活。使用层状双氢氧化物(LDH)前体制备的CrMgAl和CrMg混合氧化物已被研究为乙烷非氧化脱氢的催化剂，用于引入Cr的方法决定了所得混合氧化物的几种性质，包括表面积、催化性能、焦炭抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。
4.碱金属，如K、Rb和Cs，已知可以促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。这种促进作用归因于大碱金属阳离子稳定支撑结构、降低表面酸度和增加活性铬位点数量的能力。碱金属促进剂的存在也通过在氧化条件下协助形成Cr6+复合物来增加活性相的分散，这些复合物随后在还原气氛下产生Cr3+。然而，对于某些材料，如铬酸α-锆磷酸盐、镓铬混合氧化物α-锆磷酸盐和铬酸/氧化锆，掺杂K+会导致催化活性的显著下降。这被认为是因为钾与氧阴离子形成键，改变它们的性质，阻碍催化。

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the direct conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction is endothermic and is typically carried out at high temperatures (around 600°C) and low pressures. The key considerations for PDH include the choice of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the management of coke formation.
2.Catalysts used in PDH include platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, chromium oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts, and gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts. Pt-based catalysts are highly active and stable, but are expensive due to the use of noble metals. CrOx-based catalysts are less expensive but deactivate faster due to coke formation. GaOx-based catalysts have shown promise due to their high activity and stability, but their exact nature of active sites is still under debate.
3.Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other petrochemical products. The process is widely used due to its high efficiency and selectivity for propene production.
4.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major issue in PDH as it leads to a decrease in catalyst activity and selectivity. Coke is formed through the polymerization of hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface, which blocks active sites and hinders the diffusion of reactants. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of steam or hydrogen in the feed to promote coke removal, the addition of promoters such as tin (Sn) to the catalyst to improve its stability, and the use of supports with low acidity to reduce coke formation.
5.Catalyst regeneration is an important aspect of PDH to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity. Regeneration involves the removal of coke from the catalyst surface through combustion with an oxygen-containing gas. The regeneration process must be carefully controlled to prevent over-oxidation of the catalyst and to maintain its activity and selectivity.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，它通过去除氢原子将丙烷直接转化为丙烯。该反应是吸热的，通常在高温(约600°C)和低压下进行。PDH的关键考虑因素包括催化剂的选择、反应条件和焦炭形成的管理。
2.PDH中使用的催化剂包括铂(Pt)基催化剂、铬氧化物(CrOx)基催化剂和镓氧化物(GaOx)基催化剂。Pt基催化剂活性高、稳定性好，但由于使用贵金属而成本高昂。CrOx基催化剂成本较低，但由于焦炭形成而失活速度较快。GaOx基催化剂由于其高活性和稳定性而显示出前景，但其活性位点的确切性质仍在争论中。
3.PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯用于制造塑料、树脂和其他石化产品。由于其高效率和丙烯生产的高选择性，该过程被广泛使用。
4.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成是PDH中的一个主要问题，因为它会导致催化剂活性和选择性的下降。焦炭是通过催化剂表面的烃类聚合形成的，它堵塞活性位点，阻碍反应物的扩散。减少焦炭形成的策略包括在进料中使用蒸汽或氢气以促进焦炭去除，向催化剂中添加锡(Sn)等促进剂以提高其稳定性，以及使用低酸度的载体以减少焦炭形成。
5.催化剂再生是PDH中维持催化剂活性和选择性的重要方面。再生涉及通过与含氧气体的燃烧从催化剂表面去除焦炭。必须仔细控制再生过程，以防止催化剂的过度氧化，并保持其活性和选择性。

This process is advantageous because it is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propene, rather than a mixture of products. Industrial PDH processes are optimized to produce polymer-quality olefins. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, with many new installations already under construction worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane. The petrochemical industry is searching for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies due to the high-energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices of traditional processes. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields in PDH also promote the formation of coke, which leads to the progressive deterioration of catalyst performance over time. Catalysts need to be regenerated frequently to maintain sufficient activity. The addition of alkaline metals to the catalyst support can suppress coke formation. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant can improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium toward product formation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，其市场条件非常有利，因为丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异决定了PDH的盈利能力。该过程的优势在于它是一种特定目的的技术，仅产生特定的烯烃，即丙烯，而不是混合产品。工业PDH过程被优化以生产聚合物级的烯烃。预计未来几年PDH装置的数量将大幅增加，许多新的PDH装置已经在世界各地建设中。由于相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，美国的蒸汽裂解装置从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷。由于传统过程的高能耗需求、低选择性、石油储备的减少和油价上涨，石化行业正在寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。PDH中高烯烃产率所需的高温也促进了焦炭的形成，导致催化剂性能随时间逐渐下降。为了保持足够的活性，催化剂需要频繁再生。在催化剂载体中添加碱金属可以抑制焦炭的形成。二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，可以通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除产生的氢气，从而提高铬脱氢催化剂的活性，有效地将平衡向产物形成的方向移动。二氧化碳对催化活性Cr3+物种氧化为非活性Cr5+或Cr6+物种无效。在基于铬的脱氢催化剂中使用二氧化硅作为载体需要相对高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。由于CrOx与TiO2的弱相互作用，二氧化钛不是一个好的载体，因为CrOx容易烧结。使用层状双氢氧化物(LDH)前体制备的CrMgAl和CrMg混合氧化物已被研究作为非氧化脱氢乙烯的催化剂，实现了2730%的乙烷转化率和7175%的乙烯选择性。将Cr引入LDH前体的方法决定了所得混合氧化物的几个性质，如表面积、催化性能、焦炭抗性和抗烧结热稳定性。

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, with the equilibrium conversion increasing with temperature. However, high temperatures also promote side reactions, such as cracking and coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and space velocity. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees Celsius and pressures between 1 and 5 bar. The space velocity, which is the ratio of the feed flow rate to the catalyst volume, is an important parameter that affects the contact time between the reactants and the catalyst.
2.Catalyst types for PDH include noble metals, such as platinum and palladium, and metal oxides, such as chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, and gallium oxide. Noble metal catalysts are highly active and selective, but they are expensive and susceptible to deactivation by coke formation. Metal oxide catalysts are less expensive and more stable, but they are less active and selective than noble metal catalysts. The choice of catalyst depends on the desired balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.
3.Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for use in the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other chemicals. The process is typically carried out in a fixed-bed reactor, with the catalyst in the form of pellets or extrudates. The reactor is operated in a cyclic mode, with alternating periods of reaction and regeneration. During the regeneration phase, the coke deposited on the catalyst is burned off in an oxidative atmosphere, restoring the catalyst's activity.
4.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Coke acts as a barrier to the diffusion of reactants and products to and from the active sites on the catalyst surface, leading to a decrease in the reaction rate. Additionally, coke formation can lead to the sintering of the catalyst particles, which further reduces the catalyst's activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of a support with low acidity, the addition of promoters to the catalyst, and the use of steam or hydrogen in the feed to promote the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst and reduces the formation of coke. Additionally, the use of a regeneration step, in which the coke is burned off in an oxidative atmosphere, can restore the catalyst's activity and prolong its lifetime.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。该反应是吸热的，受平衡限制，平衡转化率随温度升高而增加。然而，高温也会促进副反应，如裂解和焦炭形成，这可能导致催化剂失活。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和空速。反应通常在500至700摄氏度的温度和1至5巴的压力下进行。空速，即进料流速与催化剂体积之比，是一个重要的参数，影响反应物与催化剂之间的接触时间。
2.PDH的催化剂类型包括贵金属，如铂和钯，以及金属氧化物，如铬氧化物、钒氧化物和镓氧化物。贵金属催化剂活性高、选择性好，但价格昂贵，易受焦炭形成导致的失活影响。金属氧化物催化剂成本较低，稳定性较好，但活性和选择性低于贵金属催化剂。催化剂的选择取决于活性、选择性和稳定性之间的期望平衡。
3.PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯，用于制造塑料、树脂和其他化学品。该过程通常在固定床反应器中进行，催化剂以颗粒或挤出物的形式存在。反应器以循环模式运行，反应和再生交替进行。在再生阶段，沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在氧化气氛中燃烧，恢复催化剂的活性。
4.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂的活性和选择性影响过程效率。焦炭作为反应物和产物与催化剂表面活性位点扩散的屏障，导致反应速率下降。此外，焦炭形成会导致催化剂颗粒的烧结，进一步降低催化剂的活性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用低酸性的载体，向催化剂中添加促进剂，以及在进料中使用蒸汽或氢气以促进逆水煤气变换反应，该反应从催化剂表面去除氢并减少焦炭的形成。此外，使用再生步骤，其中在氧化气氛中燃烧焦炭，可以恢复催化剂的活性并延长其寿命。

The petrochemical industry is driven to find more economical feedstocks and more efficient conversion technologies due to the high energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices of traditional processes.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the efficiency of the PDH process by causing a progressive loss of catalyst activity over time. This necessitates frequent regeneration of the catalysts to maintain sufficient activity. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for coke formation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include controlling the temperature and pressure, using selective hydrogen combustion to remove hydrogen and shift the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields, and using a membrane permeable to hydrogen to withdraw hydrogen from the system. However, the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, making this approach more suitable for the dehydrogenation of isobutene.
3.The Catofin process uses a chromia-alumina catalyst in a fixed bed reactor, with the reaction run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, with the progressive loss in activity counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to maintain a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst life span. The Oleflex process uses a PtSn-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor, with the reaction run at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5-10 days.

2.在Pt基催化剂上形成焦炭会影响PDH过程的效率，导致催化剂活性随时间逐渐下降。这需要频繁地再生催化剂，以保持足够的活性。获得高烯烃产量所需的高温也是焦炭形成的最佳条件。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括控制温度和压力，使用选择性氢燃烧去除氢气，将平衡向更高的烯烃产量转移，以及使用对氢气渗透的膜从系统中提取氢气。然而，这些膜的热稳定性有限，这使得这种方法更适合于异丁烯的脱氢。
3.Catofin工艺使用铬酸铝催化剂在固定床反应器中，反应在约575 C的温度和0.2至0.5 bar的压力下进行。脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热含量，由于反应的吸热性质，热含量迅速下降。催化剂可使用2-3年，随着时间的推移，活性的逐渐下降通过逐渐提高温度来抵消，以在整个催化剂寿命期间保持恒定的脱氢活性。Oleflex工艺使用PtSn基催化剂在流化床反应器中，反应在1至3 bar的压力和525至705 C的温度范围内进行。整个系统设计为连续运行，以获得连续的反应产物流。再生催化剂被重新引入到第一个反应器中，每5-10天完成一个完整的循环。

[15] "An additional problem is that the high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke."
[16] "Hence, during the selection of the operational conditions in any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion."
[17] "The first is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven."
[18] "The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled prior to being introduced into the second so-called oxyreactor, where an oxygensteam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields."
[19] "A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used."
[20] "The catalyst deactivates over time and is therefore continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits."
[21] "A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat to achieve these temperatures."
[22] "A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step."
[23] "The reaction is run at 69 bar and at temperatures between 500 and 600 C, steam being added to the feed to reduce paraffin partial pressure and coke formation."
[24] "Because the catalyst has to be stable in the presence of steam, PtSn supported on a (basic) zincaluminate is used with calcium/magnesiumaluminate as a binder."
[25] "Very little coke is deposited on the catalyst surface, and thus dehydrogenation cycles may be as long as 7 h before regeneration becomes necessary."
[26] "The first value is obtained at the start of the cycle, second at the end."
[27] "The balance between these two effects results in an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which these calculations suggest is Pt3Sn."
[28] "The left part of the figure shows high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) intensity contour maps of the Pt L-edge of catalysts comprising alumina-supported Pt (top) and PtSn (bottom)."
[29] "A shift to higher energies in the XANES spectra during the reduction step reveals that Pt becomes more electronegative, which is attributed to the formation of the PtSn alloy."
[30] "This phenomenon, which is triggered by the partial reduction of the SnO2 present on the support, is reversed during the oxidation step."
[31] "The surface of the alumina is covered with SnO2, which gets reduced when in close proximity to Pt and incorporated into a bimetallic PtSn nanoparticle."
[32] "Surface Pt atoms catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction according to the mechanism shown in the inset."
[33] "The activity of the catalysts is compared using their calculated specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of Pt per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[34] "The dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt, so all Pt atoms present at the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles can be assumed to participate equally in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[35] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[36] "Finally, as a proxy for catalyst stability, we have determined the deactivation rate (rd), for which we assume a first-order deactivation mechanism:"
[37] "where Xstart and Xend represent the conversion at the start and the end of an experiment, and t is the duration of the experiment in hours, higher kd values being indicative of rapid deactivation, that is, low stability."
[38] "The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[39] "At the same time, CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species."
[40] "To obtain high activity, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane."
[41] "Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity."
[42] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[43] "Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[44] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."
[45] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[46] "The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."
[47] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."
[48] "The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides."
[49] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[50] "Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation."
[51] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[52] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[53] "However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants."
[54] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[55] "This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[56] "Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere."
[57] "A notable exception to this promotion effect has been found in the doping with K+ of several PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia."
[58] "For these materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity."
[59] "According to some authors, this indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen."
[60] "Indeed, these workers contend that in these catalysts, potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, which causes some properties, such as the Lewis acidity and the coordinative unsaturation of the latter, to be altered in a way that hinders catalysis."
[61] "A similar argument has been used to explain the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect has not been observed for alumina-based formulations."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane into propene and hydrogen. The profitability of this process is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, which currently makes the market conditions very favorable. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propene, instead of a mixture of products. Industrial PDH processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, with dozens of new installations announced worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids. The high-energy demands and low selectivity of traditional processes, combined with dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices, have led the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies.
2.The duration of the dehydrogenation step in PDH depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to maintain a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst's life span. The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705°C. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is reintroduced to the first reactor every 5-10 days, completing an entire cycle. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, leading to progressive deterioration of the catalyst's performance. Temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which necessitates frequent regeneration of the catalysts to preserve sufficient activity. In any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion.
3.The first reactor in the PDH process is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven. The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled before being introduced into the second oxyreactor, where an oxygen-steam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used in the fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) process. The catalyst deactivates over time and is continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits. A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat. A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst in the Linde-BASF PDH process, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step. The STAR process uses a PtSn catalyst supported on zinc aluminate for dehydrogenating light paraffins isothermally at a temperature of 590°C. The reaction feed is diluted with steam, and an externally heated fixed bed reactor is used.
4.The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant improves the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, effectively shifting the equilibrium toward product formation. CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species. To obtain high activity, the operating conditions must be considered, as activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane. Alkane conversion is inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity is directly proportional to alkene selectivity. The use of zirconia as an alternative support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts is advantageous due to its low surface acidity and the enhanced sintering resistance it imparts to ZrO2. Catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than those supported on silica or alumina. The increased activity is attributed to the higher amount of surface Cr5+ produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2, which forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions. The strong interaction between chromia and the basic support is responsible for the high amount of Cr5+ on the catalyst. The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support prevents the formation of CrAl mixed oxides. However, Cr2O3/ZrO2 deactivates faster than other less active catalysts, including Cr2O3/Al2O3, due to its higher coking rate. XPS studies suggest that chromia-zirconia catalysts favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and cause catalyst deactivation. The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relatively high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Titania does not constitute a good support due to its weak interaction with CrOx, causing CrOx to easily sinter. However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants.
5.Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, promote the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. The presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation of Cr6+ complexes under oxidizing conditions, which subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under reducing conditions. However, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity for some PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, gallium-chromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia. This indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or the desorption of hydrogen. Potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, altering properties such as Lewis acidity and coordinative unsaturation, which hinders catalysis. A similar argument explains the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect is not observed for alumina-based formulations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯的方法。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。PDH是一种有目的的技术，它产生特定的烯烃，即丙烯，而不是一系列产品。工业PDH过程被优化以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。预计未来几年PDH装置的数量将显著增加，全球有数十个新的PDH装置被宣布。从石油基石脑油到美国页岩基乙烷的转变，用于蒸汽裂解装置，是由相对便宜的天然气液体的高可用性推动的。高能耗和低选择性传统工艺，加上石油储备的减少和油价的上涨，促使石化行业寻找更经济的原料和更有效的转化技术。
2.在PDH中，脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热含量，由于反应的吸热性质，热含量迅速下降。催化剂可使用2-3年，随着使用时间的增加，活性的逐渐下降通过逐渐提高温度来抵消，以在整个催化剂寿命期间保持恒定的脱氢活性。反应使用PtSn基催化剂，在1-3巴的压力和525-705°C的温度范围内进行。整个系统被设计为连续运行，以获得连续的反应产物流。再生催化剂每5-10天重新引入到第一个反应器，完成整个循环。高烯烃产率所需的高温也是焦炭形成的最佳条件，导致催化剂性能的逐渐恶化。温度和压力必须仔细控制，以实现最佳的烯烃产率。高烯烃产率所需的高温也是焦炭形成的最佳条件，这需要催化剂频繁再生，以保持足够的活性。在任何工业脱氢过程中，必须在烯烃选择性和石蜡转化率之间找到平衡。
3.PDH过程中的第一个反应器是一种顶部点火的管式重整反应器，由外部加热的炉子加热。从第一个反应器出来的气体混合物在引入第二个所谓的氧反应器之前被冷却，其中氧气-蒸汽混合物被用来选择性地燃烧部分形成的氢气，使平衡向更高的烯烃产率转移。在流化床脱氢(FBD)过程中，使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，用碱金属促进。催化剂随时间失活，并连续输送到与反应器相连的再生器中，以燃烧碳沉积物。再生过程中常规添加燃料气体，因为仅燃烧碳沉积物不足以提供足够的热量。在Linde-BASF PDH过程中，使用空气和蒸汽的混合物来再生催化剂，反应器在再生前后被净化。STAR过程使用PtSn催化剂，支持在锌铝酸盐上，在590°C的温度下等温脱氢轻石蜡。反应进料被蒸汽稀释，使用外部加热的固定床反应器。
4.二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，通过去除产生的氢气，通过逆向水煤气转换反应，有效地将平衡向产物形成方向转移，从而提高了铬脱氢催化剂的活性。同时，CO2无法将催化活性Cr3+物种氧化为催化不活性Cr5+或Cr6+物种。为了获得高活性，必须考虑操作条件，因为活性与反应温度和石蜡分压成正比。石蜡转化率与空间速度成反比，选择性与烯烃选择性成正比。在基于铬的脱氢催化剂中使用氧化锆作为替代载体是由于其低表面酸性和它赋予ZrO2的增强的抗烧结性。与在二氧化硅或氧化铝上支撑的催化剂相比，以氧化锆为载体的催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢中更活跃。活性的增加归因于在Cr2O3/ZrO2再生过程中产生的表面Cr5+的量增加，这在反应条件下形成催化活性的单核Cr3+。Cr5+在催化剂上的高量归因于CrOx和碱性载体之间的强相互作用。选择氧化锆而不是氧化铝作为催化剂载体可以防止CrAl混合氧化物的形成。然而，Cr2O3/ZrO2比其他活性较低的催化剂，包括Cr2O3/Al2O3，失活更快，部分归因于Cr2O3/ZrO2的较高焦化率。XPS研究表明，铬氧化锆催化剂有利于铬化物的形成，这些铬化物在脱氢中是不活跃的，导致催化剂失活。在基于铬的脱氢催化剂中使用二氧化硅作为载体需要相对较高的表面积来稳定Cr6+位点。由于CrOx与TiO2的弱相互作用，二氧化钛不构成良好的载体，导致CrOx容易烧结。然而，通过制备含有Cr掺杂剂的多孔二氧化钛材料，已经获得了一种活性和稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
5.碱金属，如K，Rb和Cs，通过稳定载体结构，降低表面酸度和增加活性铬位点的数量，促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。碱金属促进剂的存在通过在氧化条件下协助Cr6+复合物的形成，随后在还原条件下产生Cr3+，增加了活性相的分散度。然而，对于一些PDH催化剂，如铬化物柱状α-磷酸锆，镓-铬混合氧化物柱状α-磷酸锆和铬化物/氧化锆，用K+掺杂导致催化活性的急剧下降。这表明氧离子在丙烷的解离吸附和/或氢气的解吸中起着积极作用。钾与氧阴离子形成键，改变如Lewis酸度和配位不饱和度等性质，从而阻碍催化。类似的论点解释了当用钠掺杂铬化物/氧化锆催化剂时观察到的活性下降，尽管这种效果在氧化铝基配方中没有观察到。
