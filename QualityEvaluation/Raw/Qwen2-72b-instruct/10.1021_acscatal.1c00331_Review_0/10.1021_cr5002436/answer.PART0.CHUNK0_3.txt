[1] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "The high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[7] "The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction."
[8] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[9] "The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[10] "The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products."
[11] "The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days."
[12] "The high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke."
[13] "Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity."
[14] "By increasing the temperature, the rates of both CH and CC cleavage reactions are increased, and therefore temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield."
[15] "An additional problem is that the high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke."
[16] "Hence, during the selection of the operational conditions in any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion."
[17] "The first is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven."
[18] "The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled prior to being introduced into the second so-called oxyreactor, where an oxygensteam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields."
[19] "A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used."
[20] "The catalyst deactivates over time and is therefore continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits."
[21] "A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat to achieve these temperatures."
[22] "A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step."
[23] "The reaction is run at 69 bar and at temperatures between 500 and 600 C, steam being added to the feed to reduce paraffin partial pressure and coke formation."
[24] "Because the catalyst has to be stable in the presence of steam, PtSn supported on a (basic) zincaluminate is used with calcium/magnesiumaluminate as a binder."
[25] "Very little coke is deposited on the catalyst surface, and thus dehydrogenation cycles may be as long as 7 h before regeneration becomes necessary."
[26] "The first value is obtained at the start of the cycle, second at the end."
[27] "The balance between these two effects results in an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which these calculations suggest is Pt3Sn."
[28] "The left part of the figure shows high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) intensity contour maps of the Pt L-edge of catalysts comprising alumina-supported Pt (top) and PtSn (bottom)."
[29] "A shift to higher energies in the XANES spectra during the reduction step reveals that Pt becomes more electronegative, which is attributed to the formation of the PtSn alloy."
[30] "This phenomenon, which is triggered by the partial reduction of the SnO2 present on the support, is reversed during the oxidation step."
[31] "The surface of the alumina is covered with SnO2, which gets reduced when in close proximity to Pt and incorporated into a bimetallic PtSn nanoparticle."
[32] "Surface Pt atoms catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction according to the mechanism shown in the inset."
[33] "The activity of the catalysts is compared using their calculated specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of Pt per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction."
[34] "The dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt, so all Pt atoms present at the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles can be assumed to participate equally in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[35] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[36] "Finally, as a proxy for catalyst stability, we have determined the deactivation rate (rd), for which we assume a first-order deactivation mechanism:"
[37] "where Xstart and Xend represent the conversion at the start and the end of an experiment, and t is the duration of the experiment in hours, higher kd values being indicative of rapid deactivation, that is, low stability."
[38] "The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[39] "At the same time, CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species."
[40] "To obtain high activity, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane."
[41] "Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity."
[42] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[43] "Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[44] "De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."
[45] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[46] "The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned."
[47] "In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support."
[48] "The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides."
[49] "Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2."
[50] "Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation."
[51] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[52] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[53] "However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants."
[54] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[55] "This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[56] "Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere."
[57] "A notable exception to this promotion effect has been found in the doping with K+ of several PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared Î±-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared Î±-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia."
[58] "For these materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity."
[59] "According to some authors, this indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen."
[60] "Indeed, these workers contend that in these catalysts, potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, which causes some properties, such as the Lewis acidity and the coordinative unsaturation of the latter, to be altered in a way that hinders catalysis."
[61] "A similar argument has been used to explain the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect has not been observed for alumina-based formulations."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane into propene and hydrogen. The profitability of this process is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene, which currently makes the market conditions very favorable. PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields a specific olefin, propene, instead of a mixture of products. Industrial PDH processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. The number of PDH installations is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, with dozens of new installations announced worldwide. The shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States has been driven by the high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids. The high-energy demands and low selectivity of traditional processes, combined with dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices, have led the petrochemical industry to search for more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion technologies.
2.The duration of the dehydrogenation step in PDH depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The catalyst remains in use for 2-3 years, and the progressive loss in activity is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to maintain a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst's life span. The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705Â°C. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is reintroduced to the first reactor every 5-10 days, completing an entire cycle. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, leading to progressive deterioration of the catalyst's performance. Temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield. The high temperatures required for high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke, which necessitates frequent regeneration of the catalysts to preserve sufficient activity. In any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion.
3.The first reactor in the PDH process is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven. The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled before being introduced into the second oxyreactor, where an oxygen-steam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used in the fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) process. The catalyst deactivates over time and is continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits. A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat. A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst in the Linde-BASF PDH process, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step. The STAR process uses a PtSn catalyst supported on zinc aluminate for dehydrogenating light paraffins isothermally at a temperature of 590Â°C. The reaction feed is diluted with steam, and an externally heated fixed bed reactor is used.
4.The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant improves the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, effectively shifting the equilibrium toward product formation. CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species. To obtain high activity, the operating conditions must be considered, as activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane. Alkane conversion is inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity is directly proportional to alkene selectivity. The use of zirconia as an alternative support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts is advantageous due to its low surface acidity and the enhanced sintering resistance it imparts to ZrO2. Catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than those supported on silica or alumina. The increased activity is attributed to the higher amount of surface Cr5+ produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2, which forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions. The strong interaction between chromia and the basic support is responsible for the high amount of Cr5+ on the catalyst. The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support prevents the formation of CrAl mixed oxides. However, Cr2O3/ZrO2 deactivates faster than other less active catalysts, including Cr2O3/Al2O3, due to its higher coking rate. XPS studies suggest that chromia-zirconia catalysts favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and cause catalyst deactivation. The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relatively high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. Titania does not constitute a good support due to its weak interaction with CrOx, causing CrOx to easily sinter. However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants.
5.Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, promote the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. The presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation of Cr6+ complexes under oxidizing conditions, which subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under reducing conditions. However, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity for some PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared Î±-zirconium phosphate, gallium-chromium mixed oxides pillared Î±-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia. This indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or the desorption of hydrogen. Potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, altering properties such as Lewis acidity and coordinative unsaturation, which hinders catalysis. A similar argument explains the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect is not observed for alumina-based formulations.
