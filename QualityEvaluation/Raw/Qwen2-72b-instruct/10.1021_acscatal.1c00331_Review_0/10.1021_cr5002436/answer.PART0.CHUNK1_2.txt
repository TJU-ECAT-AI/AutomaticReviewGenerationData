1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, with the equilibrium conversion increasing with temperature. However, high temperatures also promote side reactions, such as cracking and coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and space velocity. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees Celsius and pressures between 1 and 5 bar. The space velocity, which is the ratio of the feed flow rate to the catalyst volume, is an important parameter that affects the contact time between the reactants and the catalyst.
2.Catalyst types for PDH include noble metals, such as platinum and palladium, and metal oxides, such as chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, and gallium oxide. Noble metal catalysts are highly active and selective, but they are expensive and susceptible to deactivation by coke formation. Metal oxide catalysts are less expensive and more stable, but they are less active and selective than noble metal catalysts. The choice of catalyst depends on the desired balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.
3.Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for use in the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other chemicals. The process is typically carried out in a fixed-bed reactor, with the catalyst in the form of pellets or extrudates. The reactor is operated in a cyclic mode, with alternating periods of reaction and regeneration. During the regeneration phase, the coke deposited on the catalyst is burned off in an oxidative atmosphere, restoring the catalyst's activity.
4.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Coke acts as a barrier to the diffusion of reactants and products to and from the active sites on the catalyst surface, leading to a decrease in the reaction rate. Additionally, coke formation can lead to the sintering of the catalyst particles, which further reduces the catalyst's activity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of a support with low acidity, the addition of promoters to the catalyst, and the use of steam or hydrogen in the feed to promote the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which removes hydrogen from the surface of the catalyst and reduces the formation of coke. Additionally, the use of a regeneration step, in which the coke is burned off in an oxidative atmosphere, can restore the catalyst's activity and prolong its lifetime.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。该反应是吸热的，受平衡限制，平衡转化率随温度升高而增加。然而，高温也会促进副反应，如裂解和焦炭形成，这可能导致催化剂失活。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和空速。反应通常在500至700摄氏度的温度和1至5巴的压力下进行。空速，即进料流速与催化剂体积之比，是一个重要的参数，影响反应物与催化剂之间的接触时间。
2.PDH的催化剂类型包括贵金属，如铂和钯，以及金属氧化物，如铬氧化物、钒氧化物和镓氧化物。贵金属催化剂活性高、选择性好，但价格昂贵，易受焦炭形成导致的失活影响。金属氧化物催化剂成本较低，稳定性较好，但活性和选择性低于贵金属催化剂。催化剂的选择取决于活性、选择性和稳定性之间的期望平衡。
3.PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯，用于制造塑料、树脂和其他化学品。该过程通常在固定床反应器中进行，催化剂以颗粒或挤出物的形式存在。反应器以循环模式运行，反应和再生交替进行。在再生阶段，沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在氧化气氛中燃烧，恢复催化剂的活性。
4.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂的活性和选择性影响过程效率。焦炭作为反应物和产物与催化剂表面活性位点扩散的屏障，导致反应速率下降。此外，焦炭形成会导致催化剂颗粒的烧结，进一步降低催化剂的活性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用低酸性的载体，向催化剂中添加促进剂，以及在进料中使用蒸汽或氢气以促进逆水煤气变换反应，该反应从催化剂表面去除氢并减少焦炭的形成。此外，使用再生步骤，其中在氧化气氛中燃烧焦炭，可以恢复催化剂的活性并延长其寿命。
