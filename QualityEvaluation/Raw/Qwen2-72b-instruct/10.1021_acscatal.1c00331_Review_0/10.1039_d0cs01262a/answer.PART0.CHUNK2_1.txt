[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
[2] "The deeply endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion.366"
[3] "However, side reactions, such as crack- ing, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization,cyclization, and coke formation, can be promoted even more dramatically by the increase in temperature.332,367"
[4] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[5] "It is thus essen- tial to include not only the CH bond activation but also the CC bond cleavage in the whole catalytic cycle of PDH for the kinetic analysis."
[6] "Yang et al. systematically investigated the PDH process on flat and stepped Pt surfaces, including Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211).347,349,357"
[7] "The stepped Pt surfaces having coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms are kinetically more favorable for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene than the flat surfaces."
[8] "The activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption was identified as the selectiv- ity descriptor."
[9] "Lowering the desorption energy and increasing the CH bond activation barrier of propylene are crucial for increasing the propylene selectivity."
[10] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking."
[11] "The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis."
[12] "The RDS could change with the reaction conditions."
[13] "The modeling results rationalized the experimental observation of the reduced coke formation and enhanced propylene selectivity by co-feeding hydrogen in PDH."
[14] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively."
[15] "The formed C1 and C2 species could desorb to form ethane, ethylene, and methane or serve as coke precursors."
[16] "Then, the formation of coke could block the active sites of the catalyst, impede the catalytic activity, and eventually deactivate the catalyst."
[17] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[18] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
[19] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke."
[20] "Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
[21] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
[22] "This provides a guideline for design of PDH catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance."
[23] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
[24] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
[25] "The introduction of H can decrease the desorption barrier for propylene, and therefore, the selectivity toward gaseous propylene is improved."
[26] "The Gibbs free energy of the dominant reaction pathways of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) on Pt(111) shows that with increasing H coverage the propylene adsorption strength decreases, while the energy barrier for the further dehydrogena- tion of propylene increases, leading to a higher catalytic selectivity."
[27] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."
[28] "Among them, Sn is most widely studied due to its application in the industrial process."
[29] "The d-band center of surface Pt atoms are shifted farther below the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 31(a), which changes the adsorption properties of Pt."
[30] "The introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation."
[31] "The electronic effect, i.e., the decrease in the interaction energy of the available PtPt dis sites, and the geometric effect of the introduced Sn reducing the number of PtPt dis sites accessible by propylene can weaken propylene adsorption, leading to a lower desorption barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and thus higher propy- lene selectivity than Pt(111)."
[32] "By considering the compromise between the catalytic activity and selectivity, the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is proposed to be the best candidate for PDH."
[33] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
[34] "Similarly, an improved catalytic performance was also reported on the Pt3Ti catalyst."
[35] "The d-band center of Pt(111) is located at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, whereas that of Pt3Ti(111) downshifts to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling, giving rise to weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates and changes in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions."
[36] "The barrier for propylene desorption on Pt3Ti(111) is 0.25 eV lower than that on Pt(111), but the energy barrier for deep propylene dehydrogenation is increased by the introduction of Ti into Pt."
[37] "Moreover, on the Pt3Ti(111) surface, the CC bond cracking steps are all endergonic and hence are hindered compared to Pt(111), where C3H5* and C3H4* cracking are exergonic and much more favorable."
[38] "These results indicate that Pt3Ti has higher selectivity toward propy- lene for PDH compared to pure Pt."
[39] "The metal Ga promoter on PtGa alloys can decrease the size of Pt ensembles or block the low-coordinated defect active sites, lower the desorption barrier of propylene and coke precursors by donat- ing electrons to Pt atoms, and thus suppress undesirable side reactions to achieve better propylene selectivity."
[40] "Besides, the promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
[41] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
[42] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
[43] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene."
[44] "Co@Pt is proposed to be the best coreshell catalyst for PDH if a compromise is made between catalytic activity and catalyst selectivity."
[45] "Cesar et al.370 prepared bimetallic PtCo NPs for PDH with and without added H2 and studied the effect of the Co loading amount on the core structure from Pt to Pt3Co to PtCo."
[46] "The result shows that bimetallic NPs have significantly better olefin selectivity than either single metal, suggesting that Co that acts as a less active promoter can utilize the geometric effects to enhance the selectivity by breaking up large Pt ensembles in the bimetallic catalysts."
[47] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al.331"
[48] "The isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu NPs can break the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[49] "In other words, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy maintains a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time displays quite a high selectivity, which is reflected by the low free energy barrier difference between the propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation."
[50] "Therefore,the use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
[51] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
[52] "UGO as a support could lower the energy barriers for both two dehydrogenation steps of propane, but TiO2 as a support increased the energy barriers for both dehydrogenation steps, indicating that the UGO sheet is a more suitable support for the Rh13-Ls cluster and for activation of the CH bond in PDH."
[53] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."
