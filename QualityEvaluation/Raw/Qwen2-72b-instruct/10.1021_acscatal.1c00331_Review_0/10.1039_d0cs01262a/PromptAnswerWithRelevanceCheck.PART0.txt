1.铂是丙烷脱氢(PDH)中最常用的商业催化剂之一，丙烷在铂催化剂上的脱氢遵循逆HoriutiPolanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于CH3CC*和C*的形成，它们导致裂解和最终的焦炭形成。小铂簇上的焦炭形成速率较高，这是由于较大的铂表面积。合理构建铂表面结构是提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成的关键因素。丙烯是形成副产品如焦炭的前体。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在铂基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用很强，容易发生形成焦炭的副反应，导致催化剂失活，丙烯选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了在相对较高的催化活性下提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了多种方法来修改铂基催化剂的几何和电子结构，如控制铂纳米颗粒的大小和形状，合金化铂与过渡金属或主族金属，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。

[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
[2] "The deeply endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion.366"
[3] "However, side reactions, such as crack- ing, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization,cyclization, and coke formation, can be promoted even more dramatically by the increase in temperature.332,367"
[4] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[5] "It is thus essen- tial to include not only the CH bond activation but also the CC bond cleavage in the whole catalytic cycle of PDH for the kinetic analysis."
[6] "Yang et al. systematically investigated the PDH process on flat and stepped Pt surfaces, including Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211).347,349,357"
[7] "The stepped Pt surfaces having coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms are kinetically more favorable for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene than the flat surfaces."
[8] "The activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption was identified as the selectiv- ity descriptor."
[9] "Lowering the desorption energy and increasing the CH bond activation barrier of propylene are crucial for increasing the propylene selectivity."
[10] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking."
[11] "The first CH activation of propane was identified as the RDS on the Pt(111) by a microkinetic analysis."
[12] "The RDS could change with the reaction conditions."
[13] "The modeling results rationalized the experimental observation of the reduced coke formation and enhanced propylene selectivity by co-feeding hydrogen in PDH."
[14] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively."
[15] "The formed C1 and C2 species could desorb to form ethane, ethylene, and methane or serve as coke precursors."
[16] "Then, the formation of coke could block the active sites of the catalyst, impede the catalytic activity, and eventually deactivate the catalyst."
[17] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[18] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
[19] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke."
[20] "Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
[21] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
[22] "This provides a guideline for design of PDH catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance."
[23] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
[24] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."
[25] "The introduction of H can decrease the desorption barrier for propylene, and therefore, the selectivity toward gaseous propylene is improved."
[26] "The Gibbs free energy of the dominant reaction pathways of propane to propynyl (CCCH3) on Pt(111) shows that with increasing H coverage the propylene adsorption strength decreases, while the energy barrier for the further dehydrogena- tion of propylene increases, leading to a higher catalytic selectivity."
[27] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."
[28] "Among them, Sn is most widely studied due to its application in the industrial process."
[29] "The d-band center of surface Pt atoms are shifted farther below the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 31(a), which changes the adsorption properties of Pt."
[30] "The introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation."
[31] "The electronic effect, i.e., the decrease in the interaction energy of the available PtPt dis sites, and the geometric effect of the introduced Sn reducing the number of PtPt dis sites accessible by propylene can weaken propylene adsorption, leading to a lower desorption barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and thus higher propy- lene selectivity than Pt(111)."
[32] "By considering the compromise between the catalytic activity and selectivity, the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is proposed to be the best candidate for PDH."
[33] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re- disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."
[34] "Similarly, an improved catalytic performance was also reported on the Pt3Ti catalyst."
[35] "The d-band center of Pt(111) is located at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, whereas that of Pt3Ti(111) downshifts to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling, giving rise to weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates and changes in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions."
[36] "The barrier for propylene desorption on Pt3Ti(111) is 0.25 eV lower than that on Pt(111), but the energy barrier for deep propylene dehydrogenation is increased by the introduction of Ti into Pt."
[37] "Moreover, on the Pt3Ti(111) surface, the CC bond cracking steps are all endergonic and hence are hindered compared to Pt(111), where C3H5* and C3H4* cracking are exergonic and much more favorable."
[38] "These results indicate that Pt3Ti has higher selectivity toward propy- lene for PDH compared to pure Pt."
[39] "The metal Ga promoter on PtGa alloys can decrease the size of Pt ensembles or block the low-coordinated defect active sites, lower the desorption barrier of propylene and coke precursors by donat- ing electrons to Pt atoms, and thus suppress undesirable side reactions to achieve better propylene selectivity."
[40] "Besides, the promoter towards CeO2 can enhance both lattice oxygen sto- rage capacity and surface oxygen mobility to increase the reducibility of CeO2 and consequently reduce the coke deposi- tion and improve the catalyst stability."
[41] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering,suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier,etc."
[42] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
[43] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene."
[44] "Co@Pt is proposed to be the best coreshell catalyst for PDH if a compromise is made between catalytic activity and catalyst selectivity."
[45] "Cesar et al.370 prepared bimetallic PtCo NPs for PDH with and without added H2 and studied the effect of the Co loading amount on the core structure from Pt to Pt3Co to PtCo."
[46] "The result shows that bimetallic NPs have significantly better olefin selectivity than either single metal, suggesting that Co that acts as a less active promoter can utilize the geometric effects to enhance the selectivity by breaking up large Pt ensembles in the bimetallic catalysts."
[47] "Therefore, through the experimental exploration for PtCo alloy catalysts, it is found that the catalysts exhibit superior PDH performance, especially catalytic selectivity, con- sistent with the results obtained by Xiao et al.331"
[48] "The isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu NPs can break the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH."
[49] "In other words, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy maintains a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time displays quite a high selectivity, which is reflected by the low free energy barrier difference between the propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation."
[50] "Therefore,the use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
[51] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
[52] "UGO as a support could lower the energy barriers for both two dehydrogenation steps of propane, but TiO2 as a support increased the energy barriers for both dehydrogenation steps, indicating that the UGO sheet is a more suitable support for the Rh13-Ls cluster and for activation of the CH bond in PDH."
[53] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[4] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[5] "Therefore, the rational construction of a Pt surface structure can be a crucial factor in improving catalytic selectivity and controlling coke formation."
[6] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives."
[7] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."
[8] "Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst, so the propylene selectivity is around 6080%, and the catalyst stability is poor."
[9] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at rela- tively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[13] "In addition, some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
[14] "The coreshell catalysts were found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogena- tion reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene,"

[16] "The use of dopants can improve the selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, suppress catalyst deactivation, and extend the use time of catalysts."
[17] "Moreover, selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."
[18] "The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

1.铂是丙烷脱氢(PDH)中最常用的商业催化剂之一，丙烷在铂催化剂上的脱氢遵循逆HoriutiPolanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体，因为它在能量上更倾向于CC键的断裂而不是CH键的断裂。催化剂失活是由于CH3CC*和C*的形成，它们导致裂解和最终的焦炭形成。小铂簇上的焦炭形成速率较高，是由于较大的铂表面积，而较快的焦炭形成导致更快的失活。合理构建铂表面结构是提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成的决定性因素。丙烯被确定为焦炭等副产物形成的前体。丙烯的强吸附导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在Pt基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用很强，容易发生形成焦炭和使催化剂失活的副反应，因此丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了在相对较高的催化活性下提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了各种方法来修改Pt基催化剂的几何和电子结构，例如控制Pt纳米粒子的大小和形状，将Pt与过渡金属或主族金属合金化，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。Sn的添加可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，通过在g-Al2O3表面上提供成核位点，实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧的存储能力和表面氧的流动性，提高CeO2的还原性，从而减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止它们烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，包括氢解和深度脱氢，降低碳沉积的速率，并促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。一些新型的Pt基核壳催化剂不仅可以提高催化性能，还可以有效地提高贵金属的利用效率。核壳催化剂的丙烯吸附能比铂更小，脱氢反应的活化能更高，从而导致较低的催化活性和较高的丙烯选择性。催化剂表现出优异的PDH性能，特别是在催化选择性方面，与Xiao等人获得的结果一致。使用掺杂剂可以提高Pt基催化剂的选择性，抑制催化剂失活，延长催化剂的使用寿命。此外，选择合适的催化剂载体也是修改金属催化剂PDH催化性能的有效途径。电子可以从部分还原的TiOx(x o 2)转移到Pt原子，金属表面的部分覆盖TiOx物种增加了Pt的电子密度，这可以阻碍丙烯在活性金属位点的吸附，并促进焦炭从活性位点向载体的迁移。
