[1] "Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH.2 It is generally accepted that the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism.274"
[2] "The deeply dehydrogenated intermediate of propyne (CH3CCH*) was identified as an important surface species for the CC bond breaking because it is the sole C3 species that energetically prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking, which has also been determined by the micro- kinetic analysis on Pt(111).340,353"
[3] "The microkinetic modeling of the side reactions of CC bond cracking and deep dehydrogenation, and coke for- mation indicates that the catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation, respectively.340,353"
[4] "The formed C1 and C2 species could desorb to form ethane, ethylene, and methane or serve as coke precursors.340"
[5] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area,and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."

[7] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives.

1.Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH, and the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for the CC bond breaking. The catalyst deactivation is due to the formation of CH3CC* and C*, which lead to cracking and eventual coke formation. The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area.

Propylene is the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts. Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, and side reactions readily occur to form coke and deactivate the catalyst. To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts.

1.铂是丙烷脱氢(PDH)中最常用的商业催化剂之一，丙烷在铂催化剂上的脱氢遵循逆HoriutiPolanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。催化剂失活是由于CH3CC*和C*的形成，它们导致裂解和最终的焦炭形成。小铂簇上的焦炭形成速率较高，这是由于较大的铂表面积。合理构建铂表面结构是提高催化选择性和控制焦炭形成的关键因素。丙烯是形成副产品如焦炭的前体。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在铂基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用很强，容易发生形成焦炭的副反应，导致催化剂失活，丙烯选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。为了在相对较高的催化活性下提高丙烯的选择性，已经尝试了多种方法来修改铂基催化剂的几何和电子结构，如控制铂纳米颗粒的大小和形状，合金化铂与过渡金属或主族金属，以及选择合适的催化剂载体。
