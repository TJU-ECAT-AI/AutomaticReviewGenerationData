[3] "The DFT studies by Zhu et al. identified propylene as the precursor for the formation of byproducts such as coke.354 Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and crack- ing of the subsequent C3 derivatives.

1.Pt is one of the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH, and the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt catalyst follows the reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism. Propyne (CH3CCH*) is an important intermediate for CC bond breaking. Strong adsorption of propylene leads to deep dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives, forming byproducts such as coke, which lowers propylene selectivity. The critical challenge is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts.
2.Under high-temperature reaction conditions, the interaction between Pt and propylene is strong, leading to side reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. The propylene selectivity is around 60-80%, and the catalyst stability is poor.
3.Addition of Sn can help Pt redistribute in the catalyst regeneration, providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability. The promoter towards CeO2 can enhance lattice oxygen storage capacity and surface oxygen mobility, reducing coke deposition and improving catalyst stability. Dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles, prevent their sintering, suppress structure-sensitive side reactions, reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier.

1.铂是丙烷脱氢(PDH)中最常用的商业催化剂之一，丙烷在铂催化剂上的脱氢遵循反向HoriutiPolanyi机制。丙炔(CH3CCH*)是CC键断裂的重要中间体。丙烯的强吸附会导致后续C3衍生物的深度脱氢和裂解，形成如焦炭等副产品，降低丙烯的选择性。关键的挑战是减弱丙烯在铂基催化剂上的吸附强度，抑制深度脱氢。
2.在高温反应条件下，铂和丙烯之间的相互作用强烈，导致形成焦炭和催化剂失活的副反应。丙烯的选择性约为60-80%，催化剂稳定性较差。
3.添加Sn可以帮助Pt在催化剂再生中重新分布，为g-Al2O3表面提供成核位点，以实现更优的催化剂稳定性。CeO2的促进剂可以增强晶格氧存储能力和表面氧流动性，减少焦炭沉积，提高催化剂稳定性。掺杂剂可以促进Pt颗粒的分散，防止其烧结，抑制结构敏感的副反应，降低碳沉积速率，促进碳沉积从活性金属组分向载体的迁移。
