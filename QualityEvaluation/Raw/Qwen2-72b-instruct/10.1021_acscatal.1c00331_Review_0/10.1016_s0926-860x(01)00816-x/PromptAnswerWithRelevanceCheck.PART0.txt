[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[5] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[6] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."
[7] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[8] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[9] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[10] "In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows: x2 e = Kp Kp + P"
[11] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."
[12] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[13] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[14] "Very importantly, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[15] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[16] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[17] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[18] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[19] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
[20] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has increased steadily over the past 10 years and is expected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane."
[21] "On the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
[22] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[23] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[24] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
[25] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[26] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
[27] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[28] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[29] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifications."
[30] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction."
[31] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[32] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[33] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[34] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[35] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[36] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[37] "Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[38] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[39] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[40] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[41] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[42] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[43] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[44] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[45] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."
[46] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[47] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[48] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[49] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[50] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[51] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[52] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[53] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[54] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[55] "Houdrys Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[56] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[57] "UOPs Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[58] "Snamprogettis dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[59] "Here too the coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[60] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[61] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step; because several reactors are used in parallel, an average conversion is obtained."
[62] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[63] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[64] "In Oleflex adiabatic reactors, a significant temperature drop occurs across the catalyst bed which lowers the equilibrium conversion level; a multistage reactor system with interstage reheating is used for higher paraffin conversions."
[65] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single stage reactor system."
[66] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[67] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."
[68] "The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst."
[69] "Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler."
[70] "The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+."
[71] "Another cyclical process is the Phillips STAR (steam active reforming) process."
[72] "This process uses a fixed-bed fired-tube reactor operating at a positive superatmospheric pressure."
[73] "In many respects, it is similar in design to a steam reforming furnace with the heat of reaction provided by firing outside the tubes, thus operating at near isothermal conditions."
[74] "Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 3040% for propane and 4555% for butanes."
[75] "Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby, extending cycle time from minutes to hours."
[76] "Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burnoff is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst."
[77] "Typical cycle time is reported to be at least 8 h, with 7 h of process time and 1 h of regeneration time."
[78] "For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that, for example, seven operate in the process mode while one is in the regeneration mode."
[79] "Snamprogetti, an Italian company, has commercialized fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins using a chromia-alumina catalyst with an alkaline promoter."
[80] "The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor."
[81] "In all concepts, the FBD process is very similar to the FCC process units commonly used in petroleum refineries."
[82] "However, because backmixing has a negative effect on the yields, horizontal baffles with suitable openings are inserted within the fluidized bed to limit the back-flow of solids, such that the fluidized bed is split into a series of stages, each comparable to a CSTR."
[83] "A typical process scheme is shown in Fig. 14."
[84] "Fresh feed is vaporized, mixed with the recycle of unconverted paraffins, and fed to the fluidized reactor through a distributor for optimal even distribution."
[85] "Entrained catalyst is removed from the product off-gas by means of cyclones."
[86] "Catalyst circulates continuously from the reactor to the regenerator and vice-versa by means of transfer lines."
[87] "Coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt off in the regenerator; however, because the amount of coke is relatively small, additional fuel must be burnt in the regenerator in order to satisfy the thermal requirements of the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[88] "However, while this approach is similar to that in the Houdry process, FBD does not have a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle; lack of this step is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process."
[89] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."
[90] "The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 15 in combination with the UOP detergent alkylation process."
[91] "The Pacol process consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section."
[92] "Worldwide, more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) is produced employing this process."
[93] "The flow diagram of the UOP Oleflex process is shown in Fig. 16."
[94] "The process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section."
[95] "The reactor section consists of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters, reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR section."
[96] "As noted earlier, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route."
[97] "The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1."
[98] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected."
[99] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethaneethylene splitter is otherwise too high."
[100] "Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethyleneethane stream by alkylating it with benzene."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically attains per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60% for propane and butanes, while the dehydrogenation of C10-C14 paraffins operates at conversion levels of 10-20%. The process uses chromia-alumina catalysts contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor, which can be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available and can be as short as 10-20 minutes. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, necessitating the use of multiple reactors in parallel for dehydrogenation, purging, and regeneration.
2. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the need for high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, as the process is limited by chemical equilibrium. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve these conversions. However, high-temperature conditions accelerate catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. Various reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized for light paraffin dehydrogenation, including cyclic processes like Houdry's Catofin and Phillips' STAR, which employ a sequence of steps for process, purge, air regeneration, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR), while Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system.
3. Regarding catalyst types, chromia-alumina catalysts have been traditionally used for PDH. However, in the 1960s, Bloch developed Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and minimal cracking. These catalysts are particularly suitable for the production of light olefins, such as propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures. The Oleflex process, which combines noble metal catalysts with CCR technology, has been widely adopted for the production of light olefins.
4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity. Excessive coking can lead to the need for costlier operation under vacuum or the shutdown of the reactor for catalyst regeneration. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the Oleflex process uses CCR technology, which allows noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without requiring shutdowns for regeneration. This has enabled the design, construction, and economic operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units for the production of light olefins.
5. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propylene and isobutylene. As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene. Another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction. The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has increased steadily over the past 10 years and is expected to grow further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications.

1. 催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来就已投入商业使用。该过程通常对于丙烷和丁烷的每次通过转化率在30-60%的范围内，而对于C10-C14石蜡烃的脱氢操作转化水平在10-20%。该过程使用铬铝催化剂，这些催化剂被包含在位于反应器内的固定浅床中，反应器可以是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量由再生过程中储存在催化剂床中的显热（碳烧）、直接燃料燃烧以及铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上会沉积大量焦炭，因此需要并行使用多个反应器进行脱氢、吹扫和再生。
2. 关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括需要高温以实现经济上吸引人的转化率，因为该过程受到化学平衡的限制。为了实现这些转化率，轻石蜡的脱氢需要显著高于600 C的温度。然而，高温条件会加速催化剂失活，需要频繁的催化剂再生。各种反应器-再生系统被商业用于轻石蜡脱氢，包括Houdry的Catofin和Phillips的STAR等循环过程，这些过程采用过程、吹扫、空气再生、氢还原和返回过程的序列步骤。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和连续催化剂再生（CCR），而Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。
3. 关于催化剂类型，铬铝催化剂传统上已被用于PDH。然而，在1960年代，Bloch开发了Pt基催化剂，这些催化剂能够选择性地将长链线性石蜡烃脱氢为相应的内部单烯烃，具有高活性、稳定性和最小的裂化。这些催化剂特别适合于在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻烯烃，如丙烯和异丁烯。结合了贵金属催化剂和CCR技术的Oleflex过程已被广泛用于生产轻烯烃。
4. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂活性和选择性影响过程效率。过度焦化可能导致需要在真空下进行成本更高的操作或关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。为了缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，Oleflex过程使用CCR技术，这允许贵金属催化剂在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需因再生而关闭。这使得能够设计、建造和经济运行用于生产轻烯烃的大规模催化脱氢装置。
5. PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯和异丁烯。截至2000年末，有四个丙烷脱氢装置、五个异丁烷脱氢装置和一个联合丙烷/异丁烷脱氢装置在商业运行中，总运行产能为900,000 MTA聚合级丙烯和230万吨异丁烯。另一个用于350,000 MTA聚合级丙烯的丙烷脱氢装置正在设计和建设中。基于丙烷催化脱氢使用的全球丙烯生产能力在过去10年中稳步增长，并且在相对于丙烷可用性的适当经济条件下，预计将进一步增长。然而，对MTBE使用的环境担忧预计会对异丁烷脱氢应用的未来扩张产生不利影响。

1.Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized. Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10-C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 10-20%. In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 10-20 minutes. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated.
2.In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures. The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction. The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly. The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers. Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor). For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance.
3.The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized. Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR. Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system.

The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst. Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+.
4.The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500 C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity. Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration. Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation.

1.催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用，而催化石蜡氧脱氢生产烯烃尚未被商业化。商业过程催化脱氢丙烷和丁烷达到每通过转换范围30-60%，而催化脱氢C10-C14石蜡通常在转换水平10-20%。在脱氢过程中使用铬-氧化铝催化剂，催化剂包含在固定浅床中，位于可能是球形、矮垂直圆柱或水平圆柱的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量至少部分由再生过程中(碳燃烧)储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此，使用了多个并行反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在净化或再生。
2.20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生(CCR)技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高严重性下与CCR技术相结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在高选择性下生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯，同时仍以超大气压运行。平衡转换在较高温度下增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也加速。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。这种修改降低了单烯烃和二烯烃的连续脱氢速率，而不会显著降低石蜡脱氢速率。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。高分散性也是实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应(如裂化)所必需的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝支撑材料具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为支撑材料的最重要原因是它具有保持高程度铂分散的优越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，活性和选择性都会降低。因此，支撑材料必须具有低孔扩散阻力(高效率因子)。对于给定的孔体积，支撑材料的表面积和强度随孔径的减小而增加，而孔扩散阻力随孔径的增加而减小。因此，必须为支撑材料确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。
3.轻质石蜡在Pt催化剂(如Oleflex型过程)上的转化率(方程(1))可表示为Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制下的修正一级方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化使用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。菲利普斯STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积聚仍然很低的情况下，等温STAR过程中的催化剂只有在焦炭积聚到导致催化剂活性低的显著水平后才再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。这里焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol(125 kJ/mol)。在循环绝热操作(如Houdry)中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低；由于使用了多个并行反应器，获得了平均转化率。在等温过程(如STAR)中，催化剂装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。再生是通过预热空气进行的，预热空气通过直接燃烧器或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个过程循环所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为脱氢阶段准备催化剂，并从Cr6+Cr3+还原中提供额外的热量。
4.长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下进行，为400-500 C。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持长寿命，具有高催化剂生产力。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不划算的。由于平衡限制，轻质石蜡的脱氢需要显著高于600 C的温度，以实现经济上吸引人的转化。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化使用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。菲利普斯STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积聚仍然很低的情况下，等温STAR过程中的催化剂只有在焦炭积聚到导致催化剂活性低的显著水平后才再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。这里焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol(125 kJ/mol)。在循环绝热操作(如Houdry)中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低；由于使用了多个并行反应器，获得了平均转化率。在等温过程(如STAR)中，催化剂装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。再生是通过预热空气进行的，预热空气通过直接燃烧器或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个过程循环所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为脱氢阶段准备催化剂，并从Cr6+Cr3+还原中提供额外的热量。

[77] "The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1."
[78] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected."
[79] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high."
[80] "Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60%. The process typically uses a fixed shallow bed of chromia-alumina catalyst located inside a reactor, which may be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available and can be as short as 10-20 minutes. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, so a number of reactors are used in parallel, some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated.

In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures. However, the equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, and side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Therefore, extrapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration.
3. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction. The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion of platinum is necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers.
4. Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance.
5. The rate of light paraffin conversion over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized.
6. The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500°C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity. Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration. However, because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600°C to achieve economically attractive conversions. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation.
7. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized. Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR. Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system. Here too the coke build-up is very low, and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor.
8. The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol). In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g., Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step. In an isothermal process (e.g., STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace, and the heat is introduced through the tube walls. In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst. A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system. Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels.
9. The on-stream period at sub-atmospheric pressure is followed by a purge. Next comes regeneration at essentially atmospheric pressure, followed by purge, hydrogen reduction, and evacuation to reaction pressure, after which the reactor is ready for another on-stream period. Process streams enter and leave the reactors through fast-acting gate valves. The gate valves can range up to 40 in. (1 m) in diameter, are designed for high-temperature service, and are equipped with a pressurized inert seal in the bonnet to prevent leakage of air into the process gas when the valve is closed. The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine. The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst. Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+.
10. Another cyclical process is the Phillips STAR (steam active reforming) process. This process uses a fixed-bed fired-tube reactor operating at a positive superatmospheric pressure. In many respects, it is similar in design to a steam reforming furnace with the heat of reaction provided by firing outside the tubes, thus operating at near isothermal conditions. Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby extending cycle time from minutes to hours. Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burn-off is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst. Typical cycle time is reported to be at least 8 h, with 7 h of process time and 1 h of regeneration time. For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that, for example, seven operate in the process mode while one is in the regeneration mode.
11. Snamprogetti, an Italian company, has commercialized fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins using a chromia-alumina catalyst with an alkaline promoter. The catalyst is microspheroidal with an average diameter <100 μm and an apparent bulk density <2000 kg/m3. The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor. In all concepts, the FBD process is very similar to the FCC process units commonly used in petroleum refineries. However, because backmixing has a negative effect on the yields, horizontal baffles with suitable openings are inserted within the fluidized bed to limit the back-flow of solids, such that the fluidized bed is split into a series of stages, each comparable to a CSTR. A typical process scheme is shown in Fig. 14. Fresh feed is vaporized, mixed with the recycle of unconverted paraffins, and fed to the fluidized reactor through a distributor for optimal even distribution. Entrained catalyst is removed from the product off-gas by means of cyclones. Catalyst circulates continuously from the reactor to the regenerator and vice-versa by means of transfer lines. Coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt off in the regenerator; however, because the amount of coke is relatively small, additional fuel must be burnt in the regenerator in order to satisfy the thermal requirements of the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. However, while this approach is similar to that in the Houdry process, FBD does not have a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle; lack of this step is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process.
12. UOP's catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts. The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 15 in combination with the UOP detergent alkylation process. The Pacol process consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section. Worldwide, more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) is produced employing this process. The flow diagram of the UOP Oleflex process is shown in Fig. 16. The process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section. The reactor section consists of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters, reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR section. As noted earlier, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route. The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1.
13. Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected. The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high. Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.

1. 催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来已投入商业使用。丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢商业过程的每通道转化率在30-60%的范围内。该过程通常使用位于反应器内的固定浅床的铬铝催化剂，该反应器可以是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形。脱氢反应是强吸热的，热量由再生过程中（碳燃烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热、直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可以短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此并行使用了多个反应器，一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在净化或再生。
2. 20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高苛刻度下与CCR技术结合使用，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。然而，平衡转化率随温度升高而增加，而副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也加速。因此，不能直接从重烯烃外推到轻烯烃，而不考虑其他因素。
3. 铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。铂的高分散度对于实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）是必要的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。
4. 氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为载体材料最重要的原因是它具有维持铂高分散度的卓越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，则活性和选择性都会降低。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳催化性能。
5. 轻质石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。
6. 长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下（400-500°C）进行。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持较长的寿命，且催化剂生产力高。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不划算的。然而，由于平衡限制，轻质石蜡的脱氢需要在600°C以上的显著较高温度下进行，以实现经济上吸引人的转化率。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。
7. 对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但与Houdry再生实际上是一种为反应提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积累仍然很低的情况下，STAR过程中的催化剂仅在焦炭积累到导致催化剂活性降低的显著水平后再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器与CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。在这里，焦炭积累也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。
8. 石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如，Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如，STAR）中，催化剂被加载到炉子内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床层的回混区域可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了较低的入口温度，相对于单级反应器系统。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。
9. 在亚大气压下的在线期之后是净化。接下来是在几乎大气压下进行再生，然后是净化、氢还原和压力降至反应压力，之后反应器准备好进行下一个在线期。工艺流体通过快速动作的闸阀进入和离开反应器。闸阀的直径可达40英寸（1米），设计用于高温服务，并配备有加压惰性密封件，以防止空气在阀门关闭时泄漏到工艺气体中。再生是通过直接燃烧器或替代方案，通过燃气轮机的废气预热空气进行的。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到在线温度，以启动下一个过程循环，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并且还从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。
10. 另一个循环过程是Phillips STAR（蒸汽活性重整）过程。该过程使用在正超大气压下运行的固定床火管反应器。在许多方面，它在设计上类似于蒸汽重整炉，其中反应热由炉外燃烧提供，因此在接近等温条件下运行。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压，从而实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化率。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，从而将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。需要定期催化剂再生或碳烧除以维持催化剂的活性。据报道，典型的循环时间至少为8小时，其中7小时为过程时间，1小时为再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，例如，七个在过程模式下运行，而一个在再生模式下运行。
11. 意大利公司Snamprogetti已经商业化了流化床脱氢（FBD），用于使用碱性促进剂的铬铝催化剂催化轻质石蜡的脱氢。催化剂是平均直径<100 μm、表观堆积密度<2000 kg/m3的微球形。反应热由循环回反应器的热再生催化剂提供。在所有概念中，FBD过程与石油炼制中常用的FCC过程单元非常相似。然而，由于回混对产率有负面影响，因此在流化床内插入了具有合适开口的水平挡板，以限制固体的回流，从而使流化床分为一系列阶段，每个阶段都相当于CSTR。典型的工艺方案如图14所示。新鲜进料被汽化，与未转化石蜡的循环混合，并通过分配器送入流化反应器，以实现最佳的均匀分布。通过旋风分离器从产品尾气中去除夹带的催化剂。催化剂通过转移管线连续从反应器循环到再生器，反之亦然。沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在再生器中被烧掉；然而，由于焦炭量相对较小，再生器中必须燃烧额外的燃料，以满足吸热脱氢反应的热要求。然而，虽然这种方法类似于Houdry过程，但FBD在进行脱氢循环之前没有氢还原催化剂的步骤；缺乏这一步骤被认为对过程的整体性能有害。
12. UOP的催化脱氢过程通常使用具有改性Pt氧化铝催化剂的径向流绝热固定床（或慢动床）反应器。用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃的UOP Pacol过程如图15所示，与UOP洗涤剂烷基化过程结合。Pacol过程由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成。全世界有超过200万吨/年的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用该过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程的流程图如图16所示。该过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成。反应器部分由三到四个径向流反应器、进料和中间加热器、反应器进料-尾气热交换器和CCR部分组成。如前所述，今天通过该路线生产了超过100万吨丙烯和200万吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。
13. Oleflex过程用于将乙烷脱氢为乙烯的使用也进行了研究，但到目前为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率，则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分离的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上将乙烷脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。

Coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt off in the regenerator; however, because the amount of coke is relatively small, additional fuel must be burnt in the regenerator in order to satisfy the thermal requirements of the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. However, while this approach is similar to that in the Houdry process, FBD does not have a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle; lack of this step is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process. The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 15 in combination with the UOP detergent alkylation process. The Pacol process consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section. Worldwide, more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) is produced employing this process. The flow diagram of the UOP Oleflex process is shown in Fig. 16. The process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section. The reactor section consists of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters, reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR section. As noted earlier, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route. The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1. Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected. The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high. Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.
2. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically operates at conversion levels of 10-20% for C10-C14 paraffins and 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction conditions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The process uses chromia-alumina catalysts contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, requiring the use of multiple reactors in parallel for dehydrogenation, purging, and regeneration. The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, are used in conjunction with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. The combination of noble metal catalysts and CCR technology allows for the design, construction, and economic operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, such as propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion of the catalyst is necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity, and acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The rate of light paraffin conversion over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Various reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, including cyclic processes such as Houdry's Catofin and the Phillips STAR process, which employ a cyclic sequence of steps for process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. The Phillips STAR process regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but the Houdry regeneration is a mechanism to provide heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR, while Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system. The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol). In a cyclic adiabatic operation, heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, while in an isothermal process, the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls. In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst. A multi-stage reactor system affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system, allowing for the control of thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation at higher temperatures. The regeneration is done with preheated air or the exhaust of a gas turbine, and the hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, extending cycle time from minutes to hours. Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burnoff is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst, with typical cycle times of at least 8 hours, including 7 hours of process time and 1 hour of regeneration time. For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that some operate in the process mode while others are in the regeneration mode. The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor in Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process. However, the lack of a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle in the FBD process is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process. The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section, with more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) produced worldwide using this process.

3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency of catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) by causing deactivation of the catalyst and necessitating frequent regeneration. The high-temperature conditions required for light paraffin dehydrogenation accelerate catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. The regeneration process involves the use of preheated air or the exhaust of a gas turbine to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of steam as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, extending cycle time from minutes to hours.

1. 催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用，而催化石蜡氧脱氢生产烯烃尚未被商业化。对于丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢，商业过程的每通过转化率在30-60%的范围内，而C10-C14石蜡的催化脱氢通常在10-20%的转化水平下运行。在使用铬铝催化剂的脱氢过程中，催化剂被包含在一个固定浅床中，该床位于可能为球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量至少部分由再生过程中（碳烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器周期的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此，使用了多个并行反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在被吹扫或再生。20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂与CCR技术的结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也会加速。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。高分散性也是实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）所必需的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，活性和选择性都会降低。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率（Eq. (1)）可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，对于轻质石蜡脱氢，需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有几种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化利用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、吹扫、空气再生、吹扫、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种在碳积聚仍然很低时为反应提供热量的机制，但等温STAR过程中的催化剂仅在碳积聚到导致催化剂活性降低的显著水平后再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。在这里，焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如，Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂重新加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如，STAR）中，催化剂被加载到炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，可以在较高温度下控制热裂化和催化剂失活。再生是通过预热的空气或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气来完成的。氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并且还从Cr6+还原到Cr3+中贡献额外的热量。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压，从而实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化水平。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，从而将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。为了维持催化剂的活性，需要定期的催化剂再生或碳烧。典型的循环时间报告为至少8小时，其中7小时为过程时间，1小时为再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，使得例如，七个在过程模式下运行，而一个在再生模式下运行。反应热通过将热再生催化剂循环回反应器来提供。在所有概念中，FBD过程与通常在炼油厂中使用的FCC过程单元非常相似。然而，由于背混对产量有负面影响，因此在流化床内插入了具有适当开口的水平挡板，以限制固体的回流，从而使流化床分为一系列阶段，每个阶段相当于CSTR。沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在再生器中被烧掉；然而，由于焦炭量相对较小，再生器中必须燃烧额外的燃料，以满足吸热脱氢反应的热要求。然而，虽然这种方法类似于Houdry过程中的方法，但FBD没有在进行脱氢循环之前用氢还原催化剂的步骤；缺乏这一步骤被认为对过程的整体性能有害。UOP的Pacol过程用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃，如图15所示，与UOP洗涤剂烷基化过程相结合。Pacol过程由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成。全世界有超过200万MTA的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用此过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程的流程图如图16所示。该过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成。反应器部分由三到四个阶段的径向流反应器、电荷和中间加热器、反应器进料-出料热交换器和CCR部分组成。如前所述，今天通过此路线生产了超过100万公吨丙烯和200万公吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。也已对使用Oleflex过程将乙烷脱氢为乙烯进行了研究，但迄今为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分馏的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上对乙烷进行脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。
2. 催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用。该过程通常在C10-C14石蜡的10-20%转化水平和丙烷和丁烷的30-60%转化水平下运行。反应条件是强烈的吸热反应，热量由储存在再生过程中（碳烧）的催化剂床中的显热、直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。该过程使用铬铝催化剂，包含在一个可能为球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内的固定浅床中。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，需要使用多个并行反应器进行脱氢、吹扫和再生。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也会加速。贵金属催化剂，如铂，与连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术结合使用，可以在几年内保持稳定的活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂与CCR技术的结合使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，如丙烯和异丁烯。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用，提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。催化剂的高分散性对于实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）是必要的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，对于轻质石蜡脱氢，需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有几种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化利用，包括循环过程，如Houdry的Catofin和Phillips STAR过程，它们采用循环序列的步骤进行过程、吹扫、空气再生、吹扫、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程在循环基础上再生催化剂，但Houdry再生实际上是一种在碳积聚仍然很低时为反应提供热量的机制。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR，而Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂重新加热到高温来提供，而在等温过程中，催化剂被加载到炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度，允许在较高温度下控制热裂化和催化剂失活。再生是通过预热的空气或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气来完成的，氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并从Cr6+还原到Cr3+中贡献额外的热量。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压并实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化水平。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。为了维持催化剂的活性，需要定期的催化剂再生或碳烧，典型的循环时间为至少8小时，包括7小时的过程时间和1小时的再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，使得一些在过程模式下运行，而其他在再生模式下运行。反应热通过将热再生催化剂循环回反应器来提供。UOP的Pacol过程用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃，由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成，全世界有超过200万MTA的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用此过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成，反应器部分由三到四个阶段的径向流反应器、电荷和中间加热器、反应器进料-出料热交换器和CCR部分组成。今天通过此路线生产了超过100万公吨丙烯和200万公吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。也已对使用Oleflex过程将乙烷脱氢为乙烯进行了研究，但迄今为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分馏的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上对乙烷进行脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。

A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated. In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures. The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction. The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly. Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved. Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions. However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate. For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized. Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR. Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system. The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity. Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol). In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step. In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls. In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst. A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system. Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels. The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+. The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst. Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by accelerating catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of platinum modifiers to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials, and controlling the acidity of the catalyst support with alkali or alkaline earth metals. Additionally, the use of multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology can help maintain high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity while operating at superatmospheric pressures.

1.催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直在商业使用中。商业化的丙烷和丁烷催化脱氢工艺的每道工序转化率在30%至60%之间，而C10C14石蜡的催化脱氢通常在10%至20%的转化水平下运行。在使用铬-氧化铝催化剂的脱氢过程中，催化剂被包含在一个固定浅床中，该床位于可能是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，至少部分热量由再生过程中（碳燃烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10至20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上会沉积大量焦炭，因此，使用并行的多个反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在被净化或再生。20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高严苛度下与CCR技术相结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但也会加速副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速烯烃材料的骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和聚合以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。这种修改不会显著降低单烯烃和二烯烃的连续脱氢速率，而不会降低石蜡脱氢速率。焦炭形成也被抑制，因此，稳定性大大提高。氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为载体材料的最重要原因是它具有维持高铂分散度的卓越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。对于给定的孔体积，随着孔径的减小，载体的表面积和强度增加，而孔扩散阻力随着孔径的增加而减小。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率（Eq. (1)）可以根据Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表示为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。Houdry的Catofin和类似工艺采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。UOP的Oleflex工艺使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢工艺由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的400至500°C温度条件下进行。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持长寿命，且催化剂生产力高。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不合理的。轻质石蜡的脱氢需要600°C以上的显著更高温度，以实现经济上吸引人的转化。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如STAR）中，催化剂被装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的回混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了较低的入口温度，相对于单级反应器系统。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在低水平。再生是通过预热的空气完成的，该空气通过直接燃烧器预热，或者，替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。氢化步骤准备催化剂进行脱氢阶段，并从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个工艺周期所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤准备催化剂进行脱氢阶段，并从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。
2.在高温条件下，铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会加速催化剂失活，对于轻质石蜡脱氢而言，需要频繁的催化剂再生，从而影响工艺效率。减轻焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用铂修饰剂选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用，提高对重碳质材料污染的稳定性，以及使用碱金属或碱土金属控制载体的酸性。此外，使用多级绝热反应器和连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术可以帮助在超大气压下保持高脱氢活性和选择性。
