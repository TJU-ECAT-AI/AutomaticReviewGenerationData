[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[5] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[6] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."
[7] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[8] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[9] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[10] "Thus, extrapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."
[11] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction."

[13] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."

[16] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[17] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[18] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[19] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[20] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."

[31] "Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[32] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[33] "UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[34] "Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[35] "Here too the coke build-up is very low, and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[36] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[37] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g., Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step."
[38] "In an isothermal process (e.g., STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace, and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[39] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[40] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system."
[41] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[42] "The on-stream period at sub-atmospheric pressure is followed by a purge."
[43] "Next comes regeneration at essentially atmospheric pressure, followed by purge, hydrogen reduction, and evacuation to reaction pressure, after which the reactor is ready for another on-stream period."

[45] "The gate valves can range up to 40 in. (1 m) in diameter, are designed for high-temperature service, and are equipped with a pressurized inert seal in the bonnet to prevent leakage of air into the process gas when the valve is closed."
[46] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."
[47] "The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst."
[48] "Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler."
[49] "The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+."
[50] "Another cyclical process is the Phillips STAR (steam active reforming) process."
[51] "This process uses a fixed-bed fired-tube reactor operating at a positive superatmospheric pressure."
[52] "In many respects, it is similar in design to a steam reforming furnace with the heat of reaction provided by firing outside the tubes, thus operating at near isothermal conditions."
[53] "Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 3040% for propane and 4555% for butanes."
[54] "Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby extending cycle time from minutes to hours."
[55] "Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burn-off is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst."
[56] "Typical cycle time is reported to be at least 8 h, with 7 h of process time and 1 h of regeneration time."
[57] "For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that, for example, seven operate in the process mode while one is in the regeneration mode."
[58] "Snamprogetti, an Italian company, has commercialized fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins using a chromia-alumina catalyst with an alkaline promoter."

[60] "The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor."
[61] "In all concepts, the FBD process is very similar to the FCC process units commonly used in petroleum refineries."
[62] "However, because backmixing has a negative effect on the yields, horizontal baffles with suitable openings are inserted within the fluidized bed to limit the back-flow of solids, such that the fluidized bed is split into a series of stages, each comparable to a CSTR."
[63] "A typical process scheme is shown in Fig. 14."
[64] "Fresh feed is vaporized, mixed with the recycle of unconverted paraffins, and fed to the fluidized reactor through a distributor for optimal even distribution."
[65] "Entrained catalyst is removed from the product off-gas by means of cyclones."
[66] "Catalyst circulates continuously from the reactor to the regenerator and vice-versa by means of transfer lines."
[67] "Coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt off in the regenerator; however, because the amount of coke is relatively small, additional fuel must be burnt in the regenerator in order to satisfy the thermal requirements of the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[68] "However, while this approach is similar to that in the Houdry process, FBD does not have a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle; lack of this step is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process."
[69] "UOP's catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."
[70] "The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 15 in combination with the UOP detergent alkylation process."

[76] "As noted earlier, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route."
[77] "The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1."
[78] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected."
[79] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethane-ethylene splitter is otherwise too high."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60%. The process typically uses a fixed shallow bed of chromia-alumina catalyst located inside a reactor, which may be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available and can be as short as 10-20 minutes. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, so a number of reactors are used in parallel, some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated.

3. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction. The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion of platinum is necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation.

5. The rate of light paraffin conversion over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized.
6. The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400-500°C. Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity. Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration. However, because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600°C to achieve economically attractive conversions. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation.
7. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized. Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process.

1. 催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来已投入商业使用。丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢商业过程的每通道转化率在30-60%的范围内。该过程通常使用位于反应器内的固定浅床的铬铝催化剂，该反应器可以是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形。脱氢反应是强吸热的，热量由再生过程中（碳燃烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热、直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可以短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此并行使用了多个反应器，一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在净化或再生。
2. 20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高苛刻度下与CCR技术结合使用，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。然而，平衡转化率随温度升高而增加，而副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也加速。因此，不能直接从重烯烃外推到轻烯烃，而不考虑其他因素。
3. 铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。铂的高分散度对于实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）是必要的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。
4. 氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为载体材料最重要的原因是它具有维持铂高分散度的卓越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，则活性和选择性都会降低。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳催化性能。
5. 轻质石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。
6. 长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下（400-500°C）进行。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持较长的寿命，且催化剂生产力高。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不划算的。然而，由于平衡限制，轻质石蜡的脱氢需要在600°C以上的显著较高温度下进行，以实现经济上吸引人的转化率。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。
7. 对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但与Houdry再生实际上是一种为反应提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积累仍然很低的情况下，STAR过程中的催化剂仅在焦炭积累到导致催化剂活性降低的显著水平后再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器与CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。在这里，焦炭积累也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。
8. 石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如，Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如，STAR）中，催化剂被加载到炉子内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床层的回混区域可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了较低的入口温度，相对于单级反应器系统。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。
9. 在亚大气压下的在线期之后是净化。接下来是在几乎大气压下进行再生，然后是净化、氢还原和压力降至反应压力，之后反应器准备好进行下一个在线期。工艺流体通过快速动作的闸阀进入和离开反应器。闸阀的直径可达40英寸（1米），设计用于高温服务，并配备有加压惰性密封件，以防止空气在阀门关闭时泄漏到工艺气体中。再生是通过直接燃烧器或替代方案，通过燃气轮机的废气预热空气进行的。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到在线温度，以启动下一个过程循环，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并且还从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。
10. 另一个循环过程是Phillips STAR（蒸汽活性重整）过程。该过程使用在正超大气压下运行的固定床火管反应器。在许多方面，它在设计上类似于蒸汽重整炉，其中反应热由炉外燃烧提供，因此在接近等温条件下运行。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压，从而实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化率。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，从而将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。需要定期催化剂再生或碳烧除以维持催化剂的活性。据报道，典型的循环时间至少为8小时，其中7小时为过程时间，1小时为再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，例如，七个在过程模式下运行，而一个在再生模式下运行。
11. 意大利公司Snamprogetti已经商业化了流化床脱氢（FBD），用于使用碱性促进剂的铬铝催化剂催化轻质石蜡的脱氢。催化剂是平均直径<100 μm、表观堆积密度<2000 kg/m3的微球形。反应热由循环回反应器的热再生催化剂提供。在所有概念中，FBD过程与石油炼制中常用的FCC过程单元非常相似。然而，由于回混对产率有负面影响，因此在流化床内插入了具有合适开口的水平挡板，以限制固体的回流，从而使流化床分为一系列阶段，每个阶段都相当于CSTR。典型的工艺方案如图14所示。新鲜进料被汽化，与未转化石蜡的循环混合，并通过分配器送入流化反应器，以实现最佳的均匀分布。通过旋风分离器从产品尾气中去除夹带的催化剂。催化剂通过转移管线连续从反应器循环到再生器，反之亦然。沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在再生器中被烧掉；然而，由于焦炭量相对较小，再生器中必须燃烧额外的燃料，以满足吸热脱氢反应的热要求。然而，虽然这种方法类似于Houdry过程，但FBD在进行脱氢循环之前没有氢还原催化剂的步骤；缺乏这一步骤被认为对过程的整体性能有害。
12. UOP的催化脱氢过程通常使用具有改性Pt氧化铝催化剂的径向流绝热固定床（或慢动床）反应器。用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃的UOP Pacol过程如图15所示，与UOP洗涤剂烷基化过程结合。Pacol过程由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成。全世界有超过200万吨/年的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用该过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程的流程图如图16所示。该过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成。反应器部分由三到四个径向流反应器、进料和中间加热器、反应器进料-尾气热交换器和CCR部分组成。如前所述，今天通过该路线生产了超过100万吨丙烯和200万吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。
13. Oleflex过程用于将乙烷脱氢为乙烯的使用也进行了研究，但到目前为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率，则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分离的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上将乙烷脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。
