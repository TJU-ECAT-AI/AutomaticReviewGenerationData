[1] "Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized."
[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[5] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[6] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."
[7] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins."
[8] "In the 1960s, Bloch further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."
[9] "Long-chain paraffins are both valuable and highly prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to maintain high selectivity and yield, it is necessary to operate at relatively mild conditions, typically below 500 C, and at relatively low per-pass conversions."
[10] "In a somewhat abbreviated form for the production of mono-olefins, this can be expressed as follows: x2 e = Kp Kp + P"
[11] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases."
[12] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[13] "Production of light olefins by the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins must be able to maintain reasonable per-pass conversion levels and high olefin selectivity."
[14] "Very importantly, it must be able to produce olefins in high yields over long periods of time without shutdowns."
[15] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[16] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[17] "This technology is known as the UOP OleflexTM process."
[18] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."
[19] "In addition, another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction."
[20] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has increased steadily over the past 10 years and is expected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane."
[21] "On the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
[22] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[23] "Such conditions cause excessive coking of the catalyst or require costlier operation under vacuum."
[24] "Practically, all existing catalytic dehydrogenation capacity based on Pt catalysts is based on the Oleflex process with CCR; however, there are also two smaller units for isobutane dehydrogenation for 118,000 and 13,000 MTA isobutylene, respectively, both based on the STAR technology developed by Phillips Petroleum and derived from their earlier multitubular reactor design experience."
[25] "The STAR technology is currently owned and licensed by KruppUhde."
[26] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin."
[27] "Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[28] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[29] "The consecutive reactions that form triolefins, aromatics, dimers, and polymers must be suppressed kinetically or by catalyst modifications."
[30] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction."
[31] "Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
[32] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[33] "Platinum is a highly active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities to catalyze the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface-area support."
[34] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[35] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[36] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[37] "Also, -alumina supports that have essentially no acidity can be utilized; however, the challenge is to obtain high dispersion of platinum on such very low surface area supports."
[38] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[39] "Modified catalysts possess high activity and high selectivity to mono-olefins."
[40] "The major by-products are diolefins that can be controlled kinetically."
[41] "Coke formation is also suppressed and, therefore, stability is greatly improved."
[42] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[43] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[44] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[45] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."
[46] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[47] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[48] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[49] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[50] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[51] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[52] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."
[53] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[54] "For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized."
[55] "Houdrys Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[56] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[57] "UOPs Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[58] "Snamprogettis dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[59] "Here too the coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[60] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[61] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step; because several reactors are used in parallel, an average conversion is obtained."
[62] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[63] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[64] "In Oleflex adiabatic reactors, a significant temperature drop occurs across the catalyst bed which lowers the equilibrium conversion level; a multistage reactor system with interstage reheating is used for higher paraffin conversions."
[65] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single stage reactor system."
[66] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[67] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."
[68] "The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst."
[69] "Flue gas sensible heat may be recovered in a waste heat boiler."
[70] "The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+Cr3+."
[71] "Another cyclical process is the Phillips STAR (steam active reforming) process."
[72] "This process uses a fixed-bed fired-tube reactor operating at a positive superatmospheric pressure."
[73] "In many respects, it is similar in design to a steam reforming furnace with the heat of reaction provided by firing outside the tubes, thus operating at near isothermal conditions."
[74] "Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 3040% for propane and 4555% for butanes."
[75] "Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby, extending cycle time from minutes to hours."
[76] "Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burnoff is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst."
[77] "Typical cycle time is reported to be at least 8 h, with 7 h of process time and 1 h of regeneration time."
[78] "For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that, for example, seven operate in the process mode while one is in the regeneration mode."
[79] "Snamprogetti, an Italian company, has commercialized fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins using a chromia-alumina catalyst with an alkaline promoter."
[80] "The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor."
[81] "In all concepts, the FBD process is very similar to the FCC process units commonly used in petroleum refineries."
[82] "However, because backmixing has a negative effect on the yields, horizontal baffles with suitable openings are inserted within the fluidized bed to limit the back-flow of solids, such that the fluidized bed is split into a series of stages, each comparable to a CSTR."
[83] "A typical process scheme is shown in Fig. 14."
[84] "Fresh feed is vaporized, mixed with the recycle of unconverted paraffins, and fed to the fluidized reactor through a distributor for optimal even distribution."
[85] "Entrained catalyst is removed from the product off-gas by means of cyclones."
[86] "Catalyst circulates continuously from the reactor to the regenerator and vice-versa by means of transfer lines."
[87] "Coke deposited on the catalyst is burnt off in the regenerator; however, because the amount of coke is relatively small, additional fuel must be burnt in the regenerator in order to satisfy the thermal requirements of the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[88] "However, while this approach is similar to that in the Houdry process, FBD does not have a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle; lack of this step is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process."
[89] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."
[90] "The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins is shown in Fig. 15 in combination with the UOP detergent alkylation process."
[91] "The Pacol process consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section."
[92] "Worldwide, more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) is produced employing this process."
[93] "The flow diagram of the UOP Oleflex process is shown in Fig. 16."
[94] "The process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section."
[95] "The reactor section consists of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters, reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR section."
[96] "As noted earlier, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route."
[97] "The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1."
[98] "Use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has also been investigated but, to date, the economics do not appear to be favorable because of the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected."
[99] "The cost of fractionating ethylene in an ethaneethylene splitter is otherwise too high."
[100] "Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethyleneethane stream by alkylating it with benzene."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically attains per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60% for propane and butanes, while the dehydrogenation of C10-C14 paraffins operates at conversion levels of 10-20%. The process uses chromia-alumina catalysts contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor, which can be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn), direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available and can be as short as 10-20 minutes. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, necessitating the use of multiple reactors in parallel for dehydrogenation, purging, and regeneration.
2. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the need for high temperatures to achieve economically attractive conversions, as the process is limited by chemical equilibrium. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve these conversions. However, high-temperature conditions accelerate catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. Various reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized for light paraffin dehydrogenation, including cyclic processes like Houdry's Catofin and Phillips' STAR, which employ a sequence of steps for process, purge, air regeneration, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR), while Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system.
3. Regarding catalyst types, chromia-alumina catalysts have been traditionally used for PDH. However, in the 1960s, Bloch developed Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and minimal cracking. These catalysts are particularly suitable for the production of light olefins, such as propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while operating at superatmospheric pressures. The Oleflex process, which combines noble metal catalysts with CCR technology, has been widely adopted for the production of light olefins.
4. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity. Excessive coking can lead to the need for costlier operation under vacuum or the shutdown of the reactor for catalyst regeneration. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the Oleflex process uses CCR technology, which allows noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without requiring shutdowns for regeneration. This has enabled the design, construction, and economic operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units for the production of light olefins.
5. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propylene and isobutylene. As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene. Another propane dehydrogenation unit for 350,000 MTA polymer grade propylene was under design and construction. The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, has increased steadily over the past 10 years and is expected to grow further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane. However, environmental concerns regarding the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications.

1. 催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来就已投入商业使用。该过程通常对于丙烷和丁烷的每次通过转化率在30-60%的范围内，而对于C10-C14石蜡烃的脱氢操作转化水平在10-20%。该过程使用铬铝催化剂，这些催化剂被包含在位于反应器内的固定浅床中，反应器可以是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量由再生过程中储存在催化剂床中的显热（碳烧）、直接燃料燃烧以及铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上会沉积大量焦炭，因此需要并行使用多个反应器进行脱氢、吹扫和再生。
2. 关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括需要高温以实现经济上吸引人的转化率，因为该过程受到化学平衡的限制。为了实现这些转化率，轻石蜡的脱氢需要显著高于600 C的温度。然而，高温条件会加速催化剂失活，需要频繁的催化剂再生。各种反应器-再生系统被商业用于轻石蜡脱氢，包括Houdry的Catofin和Phillips的STAR等循环过程，这些过程采用过程、吹扫、空气再生、氢还原和返回过程的序列步骤。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和连续催化剂再生（CCR），而Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。
3. 关于催化剂类型，铬铝催化剂传统上已被用于PDH。然而，在1960年代，Bloch开发了Pt基催化剂，这些催化剂能够选择性地将长链线性石蜡烃脱氢为相应的内部单烯烃，具有高活性、稳定性和最小的裂化。这些催化剂特别适合于在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻烯烃，如丙烯和异丁烯。结合了贵金属催化剂和CCR技术的Oleflex过程已被广泛用于生产轻烯烃。
4. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂活性和选择性影响过程效率。过度焦化可能导致需要在真空下进行成本更高的操作或关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。为了缓解焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，Oleflex过程使用CCR技术，这允许贵金属催化剂在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需因再生而关闭。这使得能够设计、建造和经济运行用于生产轻烯烃的大规模催化脱氢装置。
5. PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯和异丁烯。截至2000年末，有四个丙烷脱氢装置、五个异丁烷脱氢装置和一个联合丙烷/异丁烷脱氢装置在商业运行中，总运行产能为900,000 MTA聚合级丙烯和230万吨异丁烯。另一个用于350,000 MTA聚合级丙烯的丙烷脱氢装置正在设计和建设中。基于丙烷催化脱氢使用的全球丙烯生产能力在过去10年中稳步增长，并且在相对于丙烷可用性的适当经济条件下，预计将进一步增长。然而，对MTBE使用的环境担忧预计会对异丁烷脱氢应用的未来扩张产生不利影响。
