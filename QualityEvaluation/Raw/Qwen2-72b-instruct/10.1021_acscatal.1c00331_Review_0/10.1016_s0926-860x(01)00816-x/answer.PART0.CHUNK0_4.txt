[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[5] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[6] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."
[7] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[8] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."

[31] "The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation."
[32] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[33] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step."

[35] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[36] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system."

1.催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直在商业使用中。商业化的丙烷和丁烷催化脱氢工艺的每道工序转化率在30%至60%之间，而C10C14石蜡的催化脱氢通常在10%至20%的转化水平下运行。在使用铬-氧化铝催化剂的脱氢过程中，催化剂被包含在一个固定浅床中，该床位于可能是球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，至少部分热量由再生过程中（碳燃烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10至20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上会沉积大量焦炭，因此，使用并行的多个反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在被净化或再生。20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高严苛度下与CCR技术相结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但也会加速副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速烯烃材料的骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和聚合以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。这种修改不会显著降低单烯烃和二烯烃的连续脱氢速率，而不会降低石蜡脱氢速率。焦炭形成也被抑制，因此，稳定性大大提高。氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为载体材料的最重要原因是它具有维持高铂分散度的卓越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。对于给定的孔体积，随着孔径的减小，载体的表面积和强度增加，而孔扩散阻力随着孔径的增加而减小。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率（Eq. (1)）可以根据Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表示为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统在商业上得到应用。Houdry的Catofin和类似工艺采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。UOP的Oleflex工艺使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢工艺由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的400至500°C温度条件下进行。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持长寿命，且催化剂生产力高。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不合理的。轻质石蜡的脱氢需要600°C以上的显著更高温度，以实现经济上吸引人的转化。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如STAR）中，催化剂被装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的回混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了较低的入口温度，相对于单级反应器系统。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在低水平。再生是通过预热的空气完成的，该空气通过直接燃烧器预热，或者，替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。氢化步骤准备催化剂进行脱氢阶段，并从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个工艺周期所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤准备催化剂进行脱氢阶段，并从Cr6+Cr3+的还原中贡献额外的热量。
2.在高温条件下，铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会加速催化剂失活，对于轻质石蜡脱氢而言，需要频繁的催化剂再生，从而影响工艺效率。减轻焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用铂修饰剂选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用，提高对重碳质材料污染的稳定性，以及使用碱金属或碱土金属控制载体的酸性。此外，使用多级绝热反应器和连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术可以帮助在超大气压下保持高脱氢活性和选择性。
