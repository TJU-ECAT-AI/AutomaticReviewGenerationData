1. Catalytic paraffin dehydrogenation for the production of olefins has been in commercial use since the late 1930s, while catalytic paraffin oxydehydrogenation for olefin production has not yet been commercialized. Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10-C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 10-20%. In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder.

The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction. The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity. Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate. If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered. Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary for light paraffin dehydrogenation. For the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, a number of different types of reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized. Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process.

The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and also contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and, thus, to achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, thereby extending cycle time from minutes to hours. Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burnoff is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst.

Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.
2. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been in commercial use since the late 1930s. The process typically operates at conversion levels of 10-20% for C10-C14 paraffins and 30-60% for propane and butanes. The reaction conditions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and heat released in the chromium redox cycle. The process uses chromia-alumina catalysts contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder. A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, requiring the use of multiple reactors in parallel for dehydrogenation, purging, and regeneration. The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, are used in conjunction with continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for catalyst regeneration. The combination of noble metal catalysts and CCR technology allows for the design, construction, and economic operation of large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, such as propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures. The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction, improving stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. The high dispersion of the catalyst is necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation. Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity, and acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers. The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate, and an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance. The rate of light paraffin conversion over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The catalyst deactivation is accelerated under high-temperature conditions, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Various reactor-regeneration systems are commercially utilized for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, including cyclic processes such as Houdry's Catofin and the Phillips STAR process, which employ a cyclic sequence of steps for process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process. The Phillips STAR process regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but the Houdry regeneration is a mechanism to provide heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low. UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR, while Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system. The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol). In a cyclic adiabatic operation, heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, while in an isothermal process, the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls. In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst. A multi-stage reactor system affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system, allowing for the control of thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation at higher temperatures. The regeneration is done with preheated air or the exhaust of a gas turbine, and the hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Steam is used as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes.

For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that some operate in the process mode while others are in the regeneration mode. The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor in Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process. However, the lack of a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle in the FBD process is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process. The UOP Pacol process for selective long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation to produce linear mono-olefins consists of a radial-flow reactor and a product recovery section, with more than 2 million MTA of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) produced worldwide using this process. The UOP Oleflex process consists of a reactor section and a product recovery section, with the reactor section consisting of three or four stages of radial-flow reactors, charge and interstage heaters, reactor feed-effluent exchangers, and the CCR section. More than 1 million metric tons of propylene and 2 million metric tons of isobutylene are produced via this route. The performances of the Pacol and Oleflex processes are summarized in Table 1. The use of the Oleflex process for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has been investigated, but the economics do not appear to be favorable due to the low equilibrium conversion and the need to operate at a pressure lower than atmospheric if a reasonable ethane conversion is to be expected.

Dow Chemical has recently been awarded a patent for the dehydrogenation of ethane over a metal-mordenite catalyst complex at relatively low conversions, in which the product ethylene is selectively recovered from the dilute ethylene-ethane stream by alkylating it with benzene.
3. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency of catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) by causing deactivation of the catalyst and necessitating frequent regeneration. The high-temperature conditions required for light paraffin dehydrogenation accelerate catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. The regeneration process involves the use of preheated air or the exhaust of a gas turbine to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst. The hydrogenation step prepares the catalyst for the dehydrogenation phase and contributes additional heat from the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of steam as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of the reactants and achieve reasonable conversion levels of about 30-40% for propane and 45-55% for butanes. Steam also helps slow down the deposition of carbon (coke) on the catalyst, extending cycle time from minutes to hours. Periodic catalyst regeneration or carbon burnoff is required to maintain the activity of the catalyst, with typical cycle times of at least 8 hours, including 7 hours of process time and 1 hour of regeneration time. For continuous operation, various furnace modules can be operated such that some operate in the process mode while others are in the regeneration mode. The heat of reaction is provided by circulating hot regenerated catalyst back to the reactor in Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process. However, the lack of a catalyst reduction step with hydrogen before proceeding to the dehydrogenation cycle in the FBD process is believed to be detrimental to the overall performance of the process.

1. 催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用，而催化石蜡氧脱氢生产烯烃尚未被商业化。对于丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢，商业过程的每通过转化率在30-60%的范围内，而C10-C14石蜡的催化脱氢通常在10-20%的转化水平下运行。在使用铬铝催化剂的脱氢过程中，催化剂被包含在一个固定浅床中，该床位于可能为球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量至少部分由再生过程中（碳烧）储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器周期的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此，使用了多个并行反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在被吹扫或再生。20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂与CCR技术的结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也会加速。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。高分散性也是实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）所必需的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，活性和选择性都会降低。因此，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率（Eq. (1)）可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，对于轻质石蜡脱氢，需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有几种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化利用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、吹扫、空气再生、吹扫、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种在碳积聚仍然很低时为反应提供热量的机制，但等温STAR过程中的催化剂仅在碳积聚到导致催化剂活性降低的显著水平后再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。在这里，焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作（例如，Houdry）中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂重新加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低。在等温过程（例如，STAR）中，催化剂被加载到炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，可以在较高温度下控制热裂化和催化剂失活。再生是通过预热的空气或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气来完成的。氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并且还从Cr6+还原到Cr3+中贡献额外的热量。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压，从而实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化水平。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，从而将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。为了维持催化剂的活性，需要定期的催化剂再生或碳烧。典型的循环时间报告为至少8小时，其中7小时为过程时间，1小时为再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，使得例如，七个在过程模式下运行，而一个在再生模式下运行。反应热通过将热再生催化剂循环回反应器来提供。在所有概念中，FBD过程与通常在炼油厂中使用的FCC过程单元非常相似。然而，由于背混对产量有负面影响，因此在流化床内插入了具有适当开口的水平挡板，以限制固体的回流，从而使流化床分为一系列阶段，每个阶段相当于CSTR。沉积在催化剂上的焦炭在再生器中被烧掉；然而，由于焦炭量相对较小，再生器中必须燃烧额外的燃料，以满足吸热脱氢反应的热要求。然而，虽然这种方法类似于Houdry过程中的方法，但FBD没有在进行脱氢循环之前用氢还原催化剂的步骤；缺乏这一步骤被认为对过程的整体性能有害。UOP的Pacol过程用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃，如图15所示，与UOP洗涤剂烷基化过程相结合。Pacol过程由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成。全世界有超过200万MTA的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用此过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程的流程图如图16所示。该过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成。反应器部分由三到四个阶段的径向流反应器、电荷和中间加热器、反应器进料-出料热交换器和CCR部分组成。如前所述，今天通过此路线生产了超过100万公吨丙烯和200万公吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。也已对使用Oleflex过程将乙烷脱氢为乙烯进行了研究，但迄今为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分馏的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上对乙烷进行脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。
2. 催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用。该过程通常在C10-C14石蜡的10-20%转化水平和丙烷和丁烷的30-60%转化水平下运行。反应条件是强烈的吸热反应，热量由储存在再生过程中（碳烧）的催化剂床中的显热、直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。该过程使用铬铝催化剂，包含在一个可能为球形、矮垂直圆柱形或水平圆柱形的反应器内的固定浅床中。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，需要使用多个并行反应器进行脱氢、吹扫和再生。随着温度的升高，平衡转化率增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也会加速。贵金属催化剂，如铂，与连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术结合使用，可以在几年内保持稳定的活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂与CCR技术的结合使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在超大气压下以高选择性生产轻质烯烃，如丙烯和异丁烯。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用，提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。催化剂的高分散性对于实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应（如裂化）是必要的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝载体具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制，必须为载体确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。光石蜡在Pt催化剂（Oleflex型工艺）上的转化率可以按照Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制表达为修改后的一阶方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，对于轻质石蜡脱氢，需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有几种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化利用，包括循环过程，如Houdry的Catofin和Phillips STAR过程，它们采用循环序列的步骤进行过程、吹扫、空气再生、吹扫、氢还原，然后回到过程。Phillips STAR过程在循环基础上再生催化剂，但Houdry再生实际上是一种在碳积聚仍然很低时为反应提供热量的机制。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR，而Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。在循环绝热操作中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂重新加热到高温来提供，而在等温过程中，催化剂被加载到炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区的温度分布可以保持均匀，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度，允许在较高温度下控制热裂化和催化剂失活。再生是通过预热的空气或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气来完成的，氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并从Cr6+还原到Cr3+中贡献额外的热量。蒸汽用作稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压并实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化水平。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。为了维持催化剂的活性，需要定期的催化剂再生或碳烧，典型的循环时间为至少8小时，包括7小时的过程时间和1小时的再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，使得一些在过程模式下运行，而其他在再生模式下运行。反应热通过将热再生催化剂循环回反应器来提供。UOP的Pacol过程用于选择性长链石蜡脱氢以生产线性单烯烃，由径向流反应器和产品回收部分组成，全世界有超过200万MTA的线性烷基苯（LAB）采用此过程生产。UOP Oleflex过程由反应器部分和产品回收部分组成，反应器部分由三到四个阶段的径向流反应器、电荷和中间加热器、反应器进料-出料热交换器和CCR部分组成。今天通过此路线生产了超过100万公吨丙烯和200万公吨异丁烯。Pacol和Oleflex过程的性能总结在表1中。也已对使用Oleflex过程将乙烷脱氢为乙烯进行了研究，但迄今为止，由于低平衡转化率和如果要实现合理的乙烷转化率则需要在低于大气压的压力下运行，因此经济性似乎并不有利。否则，将乙烯在乙烷-乙烯分离器中分馏的成本太高。Dow Chemical最近获得了一项专利，用于在相对较低转化率下在金属-沸石催化剂复合物上对乙烷进行脱氢，其中产品乙烯通过与苯烷基化从稀乙烷-乙烯流中选择性回收。
3. 在Pt基催化剂上形成焦炭影响催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）的过程效率，导致催化剂失活并需要频繁再生。高温条件下，轻质石蜡脱氢加速催化剂失活，需要频繁催化剂再生。再生过程涉及使用预热的空气或燃气轮机的废气来烧掉沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。氢化步骤为催化剂的脱氢阶段做准备，并从Cr6+还原到Cr3+中贡献额外的热量。为了减轻焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，策略包括使用蒸汽作为稀释剂，以降低反应物的分压并实现约30-40%的丙烷和45-55%的丁烷的合理转化水平。蒸汽还有助于减缓催化剂上碳（焦炭）的沉积，将循环时间从几分钟延长到几小时。为了维持催化剂的活性，需要定期的催化剂再生或碳烧，典型的循环时间为至少8小时，包括7小时的过程时间和1小时的再生时间。为了连续运行，可以操作各种炉模块，使得一些在过程模式下运行，而其他在再生模式下运行。反应热通过将热再生催化剂循环回反应器来提供。然而，在FBD过程中，在进行脱氢循环之前缺乏用氢还原催化剂的步骤被认为对过程的整体性能有害。
