[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[5] "The length of the total reactor cycle is limited by the amount of heat available, and can be as short as 1020 min."
[6] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallel—some for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."
[7] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[8] "The combination of noble metal catalysts operating at high severity in conjunction with CCR technology made it possible to design, build, and economically operate large catalytic dehydrogenation units that can produce light olefins, in particular, propylene and isobutylene, at high selectivities while still operating at superatmospheric pressures."
[9] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[10] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction."
[11] "The consecutive dehydrogenation rate of mono-olefins and diolefins is decreased by this modification without lowering the rate of paraffin dehydrogenation significantly."
[12] "The modifier also improves the stability against fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials."
[13] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[14] "The typical high surface area alumina supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization of olefinic materials, and enhance coke formation."
[15] "Alkali or alkaline earth metals assist in the control of the acidity."
[16] "Therefore, acidity must be eliminated by using suitable modifiers."
[17] "Alumina has excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength under processing, transport, and catalyst regeneration conditions."
[18] "However, the most important reason alumina is used as support material is its superior capability to maintain a high degree of platinum dispersion, which is essential for achieving high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[19] "The catalytic reaction rate is limited by the intraparticle mass transfer rate."
[20] "If the mass transfer rate is relatively slow, both activity and selectivity are lowered."
[21] "As a result, the support must have a low pore diffusional resistance (high effectiveness factor)."
[22] "For a given pore volume, the surface area and the strength of the support increase as the pore diameter decreases, and the pore diffusional resistance decreases as the pore diameter increases."
[23] "Thus, an appropriate pore structure must be determined for the support to achieve optimal catalytic performance."
[24] "The rate of light paraffin conversion (Eq. (1)) over a Pt catalyst (Oleflex type process) can be expressed as a modified first order equation according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism."

[27] "Houdry's Catofin and similar processes employ a cyclic sequence of steps—process, purge, air regeneration, purge, hydrogen reduction, and back to process."
[28] "The Phillips STAR process also regenerates the catalyst on a cyclic basis, but while the Houdry regeneration is actually a mechanism to provide the heat for the reaction even when coke build-up is still very low, the catalyst in the isothermal STAR process is only regenerated after coke has accumulated to appreciable levels that result in low catalyst activity."
[29] "UOP's Oleflex process uses multi-stage adiabatic reactors with CCR."
[30] "Snamprogetti's dehydrogenation process consists of a fluidized bed reactor and regeneration system."
[31] "Here too the coke build-up is very low and the regeneration loop is actually a means of supplying heat to the reactor."
[32] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."
[33] "In a cyclic adiabatic operation (e.g. Houdry), heat is provided by reheating the catalyst to a high temperature during the regeneration step, so that the catalyst cools down and conversion decreases during the reaction step; because several reactors are used in parallel, an average conversion is obtained."
[34] "In an isothermal process (e.g. STAR), the catalyst is loaded inside vertical tubes inside a furnace and the heat is introduced through the tube walls."
[35] "In a fluidized reactor, the temperature profile can be maintained uniformly in the backmixed zone of the bed, while heat is provided by introducing hot regenerated catalyst."
[36] "A multi-stage reactor system also affords lower inlet temperatures, relative to a single-stage reactor system."
[37] "Thus, thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation, which are accelerated at higher temperatures, can be controlled to low levels."
[38] "The regeneration is done with air that has been preheated through a direct fired burner or, alternatively, with the exhaust of a gas turbine."
[39] "The regeneration step is intended to preheat the catalyst to the on-stream temperature necessary to initiate the next process cycle and to remove coke deposits on the catalyst."

[42] "The dehydrogenation of long-chain paraffins is performed under relatively mild temperature conditions of 400500 C."
[43] "Thus, the catalyst can maintain a long life even at high space velocity, and high catalyst productivity."
[44] "Therefore, it is not economical to build facilities for catalyst regeneration."
[45] "Because of equilibrium limitations, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires significantly higher temperatures above 600 C to achieve economically attractive conversions."

1.催化石蜡脱氢生产烯烃自20世纪30年代末以来一直被商业化使用，而催化石蜡氧脱氢生产烯烃尚未被商业化。商业过程催化脱氢丙烷和丁烷达到每通过转换范围30-60%，而催化脱氢C10-C14石蜡通常在转换水平10-20%。在脱氢过程中使用铬-氧化铝催化剂，催化剂包含在固定浅床中，位于可能是球形、矮垂直圆柱或水平圆柱的反应器内。脱氢反应是强烈的吸热反应，热量至少部分由再生过程中(碳燃烧)储存在催化剂床中的显热提供；额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬氧化还原循环中释放的热量提供。总反应器循环的长度受可用热量的限制，可能短至10-20分钟。在脱氢步骤中，催化剂上沉积了大量的焦炭，因此，使用了多个并行反应器——一些用于脱氢，而其余的正在净化或再生。
2.20世纪70年代初，UOP引入了连续催化剂再生(CCR)技术，使贵金属催化剂能够在几年内保持其最理想的稳定活性，而无需关闭反应器进行催化剂再生。贵金属催化剂在高严重性下与CCR技术相结合，使设计、建造和经济运行大型催化脱氢装置成为可能，这些装置可以在高选择性下生产轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和异丁烯，同时仍以超大气压运行。平衡转换在较高温度下增加，但副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失活也加速。铂修饰剂的作用是选择性地削弱铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-石蜡相互作用。这种修改降低了单烯烃和二烯烃的连续脱氢速率，而不会显著降低石蜡脱氢速率。修饰剂还提高了对重碳质材料污染的稳定性。高分散性也是实现高选择性脱氢相对于不希望的副反应(如裂化)所必需的。所使用的典型高表面积氧化铝支撑材料具有加速骨架异构化、裂化、寡聚化和烯烃材料聚合化以及增强焦炭形成的酸性位点。碱金属或碱土金属有助于控制酸性。因此，必须通过使用合适的修饰剂来消除酸性。氧化铝在加工、运输和催化剂再生条件下具有优异的热稳定性和机械强度。然而，使用氧化铝作为支撑材料的最重要原因是它具有保持高程度铂分散的优越能力，这对于实现高脱氢活性和选择性至关重要。催化反应速率受颗粒内传质速率的限制。如果传质速率相对较慢，活性和选择性都会降低。因此，支撑材料必须具有低孔扩散阻力(高效率因子)。对于给定的孔体积，支撑材料的表面积和强度随孔径的减小而增加，而孔扩散阻力随孔径的增加而减小。因此，必须为支撑材料确定适当的孔结构，以实现最佳的催化性能。
3.轻质石蜡在Pt催化剂(如Oleflex型过程)上的转化率(方程(1))可表示为Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制下的修正一级方程。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化使用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。菲利普斯STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积聚仍然很低的情况下，等温STAR过程中的催化剂只有在焦炭积聚到导致催化剂活性低的显著水平后才再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。这里焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol(125 kJ/mol)。在循环绝热操作(如Houdry)中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低；由于使用了多个并行反应器，获得了平均转化率。在等温过程(如STAR)中，催化剂装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。再生是通过预热空气进行的，预热空气通过直接燃烧器或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个过程循环所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为脱氢阶段准备催化剂，并从Cr6+Cr3+还原中提供额外的热量。
4.长链石蜡的脱氢在相对温和的温度条件下进行，为400-500 C。因此，即使在高空间速度下，催化剂也能保持长寿命，具有高催化剂生产力。因此，建造催化剂再生设施在经济上是不划算的。由于平衡限制，轻质石蜡的脱氢需要显著高于600 C的温度，以实现经济上吸引人的转化。在高温条件下，催化剂失活加速，轻质石蜡脱氢需要频繁的催化剂再生。对于轻质石蜡的脱氢，有多种不同类型的反应器-再生系统被商业化使用。Houdry的Catofin和类似过程采用循环序列的步骤——过程、净化、空气再生、净化、氢还原，然后回到过程。菲利普斯STAR过程也在循环基础上再生催化剂，但虽然Houdry再生实际上是一种提供热量的机制，即使在焦炭积聚仍然很低的情况下，等温STAR过程中的催化剂只有在焦炭积聚到导致催化剂活性低的显著水平后才再生。UOP的Oleflex过程使用多级绝热反应器和CCR。Snamprogetti的脱氢过程由流化床反应器和再生系统组成。这里焦炭积聚也很低，再生循环实际上是向反应器提供热量的一种方式。石蜡脱氢的反应热约为30 kcal/mol(125 kJ/mol)。在循环绝热操作(如Houdry)中，热量通过在再生步骤中将催化剂加热到高温来提供，因此催化剂在反应步骤中冷却，转化率降低；由于使用了多个并行反应器，获得了平均转化率。在等温过程(如STAR)中，催化剂装在炉内的垂直管内，热量通过管壁引入。在流化反应器中，床的背混区可以保持均匀的温度分布，而热量通过引入热再生催化剂来提供。多级反应器系统还提供了相对单级反应器系统较低的入口温度。因此，热裂化和催化剂失活，这些在较高温度下加速，可以控制在较低水平。再生是通过预热空气进行的，预热空气通过直接燃烧器或替代地，通过燃气轮机的废气。再生步骤的目的是将催化剂预热到启动下一个过程循环所需的在线温度，并去除催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。烟气显热可以在废热锅炉中回收。氢化步骤为脱氢阶段准备催化剂，并从Cr6+Cr3+还原中提供额外的热量。
