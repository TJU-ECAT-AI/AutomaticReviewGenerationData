1.Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in the 1980s, is a major technique for propylene production and contributes significantly to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation, particularly in the commercial Oleflex process. However, these catalysts are prone to rapid deactivation due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is not fully understood. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It also aids in the rational design of catalysts that maintain activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt and modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, focusing on reducing the coking rate by modifying the Pt with elements like Sn or alkali metals and using different catalyst supports. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions, and coke can form on either the support or the metal, with different effects on catalyst deactivation. Studies on the impact of reaction conditions, particularly gas compositions, on coke formation and the nature of coke deposited on different sites are essential for understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and catalyst deactivation. However, such studies are scarce in the literature.

1.丙烷脱氢技术在20世纪80年代商业化发展，是丙烯生产的主要技术之一，对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。基于铂的催化剂在丙烷脱氢中广泛应用，特别是在商业Oleflex工艺中。然而，这些催化剂容易因焦炭形成而迅速失活，铂催化剂上的焦炭形成机制尚未完全理解。理解焦炭形成机制对于优化反应条件、减少脱氢和再生周期的频率、从而提高丙烯产量至关重要。它还帮助合理设计催化剂，保持活性和选择性，同时最小化焦炭形成。许多研究者研究了丙烷脱氢过程中铂和改性铂催化剂上的焦炭形成，重点是通过用Sn或碱金属等元素改性铂，以及使用不同的催化剂载体来降低焦炭形成速率。焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作条件，焦炭可以在载体或金属上形成，对催化剂失活有不同的影响。研究反应条件，特别是气体组成，对焦炭形成速率和不同部位沉积的焦炭性质的影响，对于理解焦炭形成和催化剂失活的机制至关重要。然而，这类研究在文献中很少见。
