[1] "Recently the rapidly rising needs for propylene [13] have driven searching for new propylene production techniques. Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
[3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
[4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
[6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
[7] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
[8] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."
[9] "Studies on the influences of reaction conditions on the rate of coke formation and the nature of the coke deposited on different sites are essential for the understanding of the mechanism of coke formation as well as the mechanism of catalyst deactivation."
[10] "However, studies on the influences of reaction conditions, especially gas compositions, during propane dehydrogenation are seldom reported."

1.Propane dehydrogenation is a technique for propylene production that has been developed commercially since the 1980s and is now making significant contributions to the world's propylene supply. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is still unclear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It can also help in the rational design of catalysts to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with Sn or alkali metals or using different catalyst supports. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions, and coke can form on either the support or the metal, with different effects on catalyst deactivation. Studies on the influences of reaction conditions, especially gas compositions, during propane dehydrogenation are essential for understanding the mechanism of coke formation and catalyst deactivation, but such studies are rarely reported.

1.丙烷脱氢是一种自20世纪80年代以来商业化发展的丙烯生产技术，现在对世界丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。Pt基催化剂是丙烷脱氢中最受欢迎的催化剂，用于商业Oleflex工艺中。然而，这些催化剂会迅速失活，主要是由于焦炭的形成，而Pt催化剂上焦炭形成的机制仍然不清楚。理解焦炭形成的机制对于优化反应条件、减少脱氢和再生周期的频率、从而提高丙烯产量至关重要。它还可以帮助合理设计催化剂，以减少焦炭形成速率，同时保持脱氢中的活性和选择性。许多研究人员研究了丙烷脱氢期间Pt或改性Pt催化剂上的焦炭形成，大多数研究旨在通过用Sn或碱金属改性Pt或使用不同的催化剂载体来降低焦炭形成速率。焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作条件，焦炭可以在支撑物或金属上形成，对催化剂失活有不同的影响。研究反应条件，特别是丙烷脱氢期间的气体组成，对焦炭形成速率和不同部位沉积的焦炭性质的影响，对于理解焦炭形成和催化剂失活的机制至关重要，但这类研究很少被报道。
