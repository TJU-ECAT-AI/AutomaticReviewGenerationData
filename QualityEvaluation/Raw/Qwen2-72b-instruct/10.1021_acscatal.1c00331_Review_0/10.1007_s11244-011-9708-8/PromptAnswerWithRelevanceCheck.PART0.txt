[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."
[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process."
[3] "This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."
[4] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."
[5] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers."
[6] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."
[7] "Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst."
[8] "Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization."
[9] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions."
[10] "Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."
[11] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."
[12] "Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed."

1.Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in the 1980s, is a major technique for propylene production and has made significant contributions to the world's propylene supply in recent years. Pt-based catalysts are the most popular for propane dehydrogenation and are used in commercial Oleflex processes. However, these catalysts, along with other alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, are quickly deactivated, mainly due to coke formation. The mechanism of coke formation on Pt catalysts is not yet fully understood. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, thereby increasing propylene productivity. It also aids in the rational design of catalysts to minimize coke formation while maintaining activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation. Many researchers have studied coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, with most studies aimed at reducing the coking rate by modifying Pt with elements like Sn or alkali metals, or by using different catalyst supports. Alkali metals, such as Li, Na, and K, have been shown to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can also reduce coke formation by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization. The rate of coke formation is highly dependent on operating conditions. Studies have suggested that hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation and the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Coke formation is a structure-sensitive reaction, and hydrogen can decrease both the rate of coke formation and the deactivating effect of the coke formed.

1.丙烷脱氢技术，自20世纪80年代商业化以来，是丙烯生产的主要技术之一，近年来对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。铂基催化剂是丙烷脱氢中最常用的催化剂，广泛应用于商业Oleflex工艺中。然而，这些催化剂，以及其它烷烃脱氢催化剂，会迅速失活，主要原因是焦炭的形成。铂催化剂上焦炭形成的机制尚未完全理解。理解这一机制对于优化反应条件、减少脱氢和再生周期的频率、从而提高丙烯产量至关重要。它还帮助合理设计催化剂，以在保持脱氢活性和选择性的同时，最小化焦炭的形成。许多研究者研究了丙烷脱氢过程中铂或改性铂催化剂上的焦炭形成，大多数研究旨在通过用Sn或碱金属等元素改性铂，或使用不同的催化剂载体，来降低焦炭的形成速率。碱金属，如锂、钠和钾，已被证明通过向铂催化剂提供过量的可移动电子来降低焦炭形成速率。使用弱酸性载体，如SBA-15，也可以通过减弱丙烯吸附和抑制丙烯脱氢或聚合来减少焦炭的形成。焦炭形成速率高度依赖于操作条件。研究表明，氢气可以减少焦炭形成速率和催化剂失活速率，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，但不能去除已经形成在催化剂上的焦炭。焦炭形成是一个结构敏感的反应，氢气可以降低焦炭形成速率和焦炭形成的失活效应。
