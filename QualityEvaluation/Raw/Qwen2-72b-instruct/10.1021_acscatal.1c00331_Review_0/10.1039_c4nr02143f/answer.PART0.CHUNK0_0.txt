[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
[2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
[4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
[5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
[6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
[7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
[8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."
[9] "Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion."
[10] "Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."
[11] "However, many problems of Pt,such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke forma-tion10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the gener-ation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic effi-ciency of Pt catalysts."
[12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low cost of the PDH process. However, PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring relatively high reaction temperatures to obtain high yields of propylene. These conditions can lead to undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and rapid coke deposition, causing catalyst deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the process efficiency. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, but they face challenges such as significant catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters like Cu, which inhibits propylene adsorption, diminishing the possibility of coke formation and suppressing the cracking reaction towards lighter hydrocarbons, while also increasing the energy barrier for CC bond cleavage.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，因为它将低成本的饱和烃转化为高价值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。由于对天然气作为丙烷资源的广泛开采，PDH过程的可行性和低成本得到了保证，这尤其具有优势。然而，PDH是一种吸热和平衡受限的反应，为了获得高产率的丙烯，需要相对较高的反应温度。这些条件可能导致不希望的热裂解，产生较轻的烃类，并迅速沉积焦炭，导致催化剂失活。开发具有高丙烯选择性、优异的抗焦炭能力以及高丙烷转化率的催化材料对于过程效率至关重要。基于铂的催化剂因其高催化活性和热稳定性而受到青睐，但它们面临着诸如由于焦炭形成导致的显著催化剂失活以及由于CC键断裂产生较轻的烃类导致的丙烯选择性低等挑战。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括添加如Cu等促进剂，这可以抑制丙烯吸附，减少焦炭形成的可能性，抑制向较轻烃类的裂解反应，同时增加CC键断裂的能量屏障。
