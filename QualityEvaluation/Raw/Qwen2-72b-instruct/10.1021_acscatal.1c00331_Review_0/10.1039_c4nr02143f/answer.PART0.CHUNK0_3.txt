1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is particularly advantageous due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions can result in undesired thermal cracking, generating lighter hydrocarbons and causing rapid coke deposition on the catalyst, leading to deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, with a lower coke formation rate compared to Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage limit the catalytic performance and efficiency of Pt catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the addition of promoters such as Cu, which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbons, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，因为它将低成本的饱和烃转化为高附加值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。由于天然气作为丙烷资源的广泛开采，PDH过程的可行性和低成本得到了保证，这尤其有利。然而，丙烷的脱氢是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，为了获得高产率的丙烯，需要相对较高的反应温度。这样的反应条件会导致不希望的热裂解，产生较轻的烃类，并在催化剂上迅速沉积焦炭，导致催化剂失活。开发具有高丙烯选择性、优异的抗焦炭能力和高丙烷转化率的催化材料对于PDH过程的效率至关重要。基于铂的催化剂因其高催化活性和热稳定性而受到青睐，与基于铬的催化剂相比，其焦炭形成率较低。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的显著催化剂失活和由于CC键断裂产生较轻烃类导致的丙烯选择性降低，限制了铂催化剂的催化性能和效率。为了减轻焦炭的形成并提高催化剂的再生，可以采取添加如Cu等促进剂的策略，这可以抑制焦炭和较轻烃类的形成，增强催化剂的稳定性和选择性。
