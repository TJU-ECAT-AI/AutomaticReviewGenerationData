[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
[2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

[12] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising method for propene production, as it converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive. The process is favored due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. This can result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons and rapid coke deposition, causing catalyst deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial. Pt-based catalysts are preferred for their high catalytic activity and thermal stability, but they face challenges such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity due to the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include inhibiting propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, and increasing the energy barrier for CC bond cleavage to suppress methane formation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种有前途的方法，因为它将低成本的饱和烃转化为高价值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。由于天然气作为丙烷资源的广泛开采，保证了PDH过程的可行性和低成本，因此该过程受到青睐。然而，丙烷的脱氢是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，为了获得高产率的丙烯，需要相对较高的反应温度。这可能导致不希望的热裂解，产生较轻的烃类，并迅速沉积焦炭，导致催化剂失活。开发具有高丙烯选择性、优异的抗焦炭能力和高丙烷转化率的催化材料至关重要。基于铂的催化剂因其高催化活性和热稳定性而受到青睐，但它们面临着由焦炭形成引起的催化剂显著失活和由CC键断裂产生的较轻烃类导致的丙烯选择性低的挑战。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括抑制丙烯吸附，这减少了焦炭形成的可能性，抑制了向较轻烃类的裂解反应，并增加CC键断裂的能量势垒，以抑制甲烷的形成。
