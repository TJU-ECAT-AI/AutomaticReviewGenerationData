[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chem-icals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acryloni-trile."
[2] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil."
[3] "However,the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."
[4] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6"
[5] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."
[6] "Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3"
[7] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene."
[8] "Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[14] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it an economically competitive route. The process is particularly favored due to the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane, which guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, requiring a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yields of propylene. This can result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons and rapid coke deposition, causing catalyst deactivation. Developing catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity, excellent anti-coking ability, and high propane conversion is crucial for the efficiency of the PDH process. Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts have excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts. However, significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity resulting from the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic efficiency of Pt catalysts. The inhibited propylene adsorption on PtCu/Al2O3 diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation, improving the process efficiency and catalyst regeneration.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种将低成本饱和烃转化为高价值烯烃的丙烯生产方法，使其成为经济上具有竞争力的路线。由于对天然气作为丙烷资源的广泛开采，保证了PDH过程的可行性和低成本，因此该过程特别受到青睐。然而，丙烷的脱氢是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，为了获得高产率的丙烯，需要相对较高的反应温度。这可能导致不希望的热裂解，生成较轻的烃类，并迅速沉积焦炭，导致催化剂失活。开发具有高丙烯选择性、优异的抗焦炭能力以及高丙烷转化率的催化材料对于PDH过程的效率至关重要。目前，铬基和铂基催化剂是PDH的主流商业催化剂。Cr基催化剂具有优异的催化性能和良好的抗中毒能力，但其应用受到铬毒性的限制。Pt基催化剂显示出高催化活性和热稳定性，焦炭形成率远低于Cr基催化剂。然而，由于焦炭形成导致的显著催化剂失活和通过CC键断裂生成较轻烃类导致的低丙烯选择性，限制了Pt催化剂的催化性能和催化效率。在PtCu/Al2O3上抑制丙烯吸附减少了焦炭形成的可能性，抑制了向较轻烃类的裂解反应，而较高的CC键断裂能垒抑制了甲烷的形成，提高了过程效率和催化剂再生。
