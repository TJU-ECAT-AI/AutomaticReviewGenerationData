1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。
