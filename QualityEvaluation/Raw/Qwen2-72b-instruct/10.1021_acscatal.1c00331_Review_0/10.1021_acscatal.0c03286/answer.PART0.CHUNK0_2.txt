1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, cannot meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. Therefore, the critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high propylene selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, which have shown promising results in PDH with minimal use of noble metal and high anticoking ability.

1.由于对丙烯的需求日益增加，传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，无法满足需求，丙烷脱氢(PDH)成为丙烯生产的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性成分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这个问题，通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强工业过程中的丙烯选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。因此，PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；并提高抗焦化能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高丙烯选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，在PDH中显示出有希望的结果，具有最小的贵金属使用和高抗焦化能力。
