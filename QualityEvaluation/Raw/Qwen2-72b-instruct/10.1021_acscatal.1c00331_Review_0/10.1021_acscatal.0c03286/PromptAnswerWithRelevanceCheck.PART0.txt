1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, can hardly meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which can be mitigated by designing catalysts with high selectivity and stability, such as atomically dispersed Pt catalysts that inhibit undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and stability.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)由于对丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足，因此成为生产丙烯的重要替代方法。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为了解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为促进剂添加到单金属Pt催化剂中，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，这可以通过设计具有高选择性和稳定性的催化剂来缓解，例如原子分散的Pt催化剂，可以抑制不希望的副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和稳定性。

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production due to the increasing demand for propene that traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, cannot meet. Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. To address this issue, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process. However, the addition of Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. Moreover, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. The critical requirements in PDH are to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity, and increase anticoking ability. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, which leads to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single-atom catalysts, which can minimize noble metal usage and exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties, such as enhanced desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibition of its further dehydrogenation. Additionally, the use of Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%. Furthermore, the use of different doped graphene strategies can tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range, and the single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的一种重要替代方法，由于丙烯需求的不断增加，传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解已无法满足需求。由于其优越的活性，贵金属Pt被广泛用作PDH中的活性组分，但其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。为解决这一问题，工业过程中通常将Sn作为单金属Pt催化剂的助剂，以增强丙烯的选择性。然而，添加Sn会显著降低PDH的反应速率。此外，由于焦炭的形成导致的催化剂逐渐失活仍然是一个无法克服的问题。PDH中的关键要求是：最小化贵金属Pt的使用，以降低生产成本；在高活性水平下保持高丙烯选择性；提高抗焦炭能力。Pt基催化剂上焦炭的形成通过催化剂失活影响过程效率，导致活性和选择性的下降。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子催化剂，它可以最小化贵金属的使用，并表现出更出色的催化性能，如增强表面结合丙烯的解吸和禁止其进一步脱氢。此外，使用分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的Pt单原子可以显著增强表面结合丙烯的解吸，禁止其进一步脱氢，显示出90%的丙烯选择性。此外，使用不同的石墨烯掺杂策略可以广泛调节支撑Pt原子的电子结构，预测具有最正电荷的单Pt原子是最活跃的，且不易发生深度脱氢，使用第一性原理计算。
