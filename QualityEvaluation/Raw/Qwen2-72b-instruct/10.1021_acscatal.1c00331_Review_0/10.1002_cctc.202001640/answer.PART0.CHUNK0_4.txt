1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies such as the addition of promoters like Sn have been implemented. The promoter can increase the lifetime of the catalyst by reducing deactivation due to coking. Microwave irradiation has also been found to be a promising approach to reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the PDH process. The use of microwave irradiation can increase reaction rates and selectivity, and save energy through reductions in the reaction temperature and time. The development of excellent microwave catalysts, such as CoSn/NC, is critical for achieving highly effective direct dehydrogenation reactions under microwave catalysis.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及在强烈的吸热反应中将丙烷转化为丙烯。该反应受到热力学平衡的限制，高丙烷转化率在很大程度上取决于550-700°C的高温。然而，在高温下，C-C键比C-H键更具反应性，导致不必要的副反应和焦炭沉积，这可能会使催化剂烧结。为了减轻Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，已经实施了诸如添加Sn等促进剂的策略。促进剂可以通过减少由于焦化导致的失活来延长催化剂的寿命。已经发现微波照射是减少能源消耗和提高PDH过程效率的有希望的方法。微波照射的使用可以提高反应速率和选择性，并通过降低反应温度和时间来节省能源。开发出色的微波催化剂，如CoSn/NC，对于在微波催化下实现高效直接脱氢反应至关重要。
