1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have the potential to be commercialized in the future and have shown promising catalytic properties. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve the direct dehydrogenation of propane at lower temperatures.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯的强吸热反应。该反应受热力学平衡的限制，高丙烷转化率在很大程度上取决于550-700°C的高温。然而，在高温下，C-C键比C-H键更具反应性，导致不必要的副反应和焦炭沉积，这可能会使催化剂烧结。为了减轻Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成，提高过程效率，可以实施诸如使用Sn等促进元素等策略。Sn的添加已被证明可以延长Pt基催化剂的寿命，通过减少由于焦化导致的失活。此外，开发更高效和新型催化剂，如Co基催化剂，目前是主要的研究兴趣。这些催化剂有潜力在未来商业化，并显示出有希望的催化性能。正在探索使用微波照射作为在较低温度下减少能源消耗和改善丙烷直接脱氢的手段。
