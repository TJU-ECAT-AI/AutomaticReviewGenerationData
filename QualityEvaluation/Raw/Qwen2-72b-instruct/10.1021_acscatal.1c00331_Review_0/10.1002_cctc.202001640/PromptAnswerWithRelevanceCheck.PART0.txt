1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the C-C bond becomes more reactive than the C-H bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies such as the use of promoter elements like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the use of microwave irradiation can reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the PDH process by accelerating the reaction rate and selectivity at lower temperatures.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯的强吸热反应。该反应受热力学平衡的限制，高丙烷转化率在很大程度上取决于550-700°C的高温。然而，在高温下，C-C键比C-H键更具反应性，导致不必要的副反应和焦炭沉积，这可能会使催化剂烧结。为了减轻Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以实施使用促进元素（如Sn）的策略。Sn的添加已被证明可以延长Pt基催化剂的寿命，通过减少由于焦化导致的失活。此外，使用微波照射可以降低能量消耗，并通过在较低温度下加速反应速率和选择性来提高PDH过程的效率。

The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the CC bond becomes more reactive than the CH bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoters like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have better catalytic performance among non-precious metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
