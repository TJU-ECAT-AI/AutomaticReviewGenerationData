1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene in a strongly endothermic reaction. The reaction is restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium, and a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550-700°C. However, at high temperatures, the CC bond becomes more reactive than the CH bond, leading to unnecessary side reactions and coke deposition, which can sinter the catalyst. To mitigate coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and improve process efficiency, strategies such as the use of promoters like Sn can be implemented. The addition of Sn has been shown to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts by reducing deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, the development of more efficient and novel catalysts, such as Co-based catalysts, is currently a major research interest. These catalysts have better catalytic performance among non-precious metal catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of microwave irradiation is also being explored as a means to reduce energy consumption and improve reaction rates and selectivity in PDH reactions.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯的强烈吸热反应。该反应受热力学平衡的限制，高丙烷转化率在很大程度上取决于550-700°C的高温。然而，在高温下，CC键比CH键更具反应性，导致不必要的副反应和焦炭沉积，这可能会使催化剂烧结。为了减轻Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成，提高过程效率，可以实施如使用Sn等促进剂等策略。Sn的添加已被证明可以延长Pt基催化剂的寿命，通过减少由于焦化导致的失活。此外，开发更高效和新型催化剂，如Co基催化剂，目前是主要的研究兴趣。这些催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中在非贵金属催化剂中具有更好的催化性能。正在探索使用微波照射作为减少能量消耗和提高PDH反应中的反应速率和选择性的手段。
