1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, remains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms. Additionally, this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal stability compared with conventional single-atom alloys. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1 site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of surface-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种商业丙烯生产技术，已受到广泛关注，但高温反应会导致丙烯选择性降低和催化剂稳定性下降。因此，在高温下烷烃脱氢领域开发高效稳定的SACs仍然是一个重大挑战。原子有序的Pt1M1金属间合金（IMA）（Pt/M的摩尔比为1）含有一种活性金属Pt和另一种惰性组分M，M原子可以将活性位点分散成孤立的Pt1位点。此外，这种高度有序的晶体结构为活性位点提供了比传统单原子合金更高的热稳定性。PtZn IMAs中的表面[PtZn4]集合体作为关键的活性位点结构，在[PtZn4]集合体中，几何孤立和电子丰富的Pt1位点可以有效地促进丙烷的第一次和第二次C H断裂，但抑制表面束缚丙烯的进一步脱氢。这通过禁止焦炭副反应显著提高了选择性和稳定性。
