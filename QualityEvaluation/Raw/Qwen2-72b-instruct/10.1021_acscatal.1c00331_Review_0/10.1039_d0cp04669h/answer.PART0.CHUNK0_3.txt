1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by removing hydrogen from propane. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the selectivity and activity of the reaction. Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for PDH, but they are susceptible to coke formation, which can deactivate the catalyst and reduce process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using promoters, such as phosphate, to stabilize the catalyst surface and prevent the accumulation of coke. Catalyst regeneration can also be implemented to restore the activity of the deactivated catalyst.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在过程效率中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的选择也很关键，因为它影响反应的选择性和活性。Pt基催化剂通常用于PDH，但它们容易形成焦炭，这会钝化催化剂，降低过程效率。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用促进剂，如磷酸盐，来稳定催化剂表面，防止焦炭的积累。催化剂再生也可以实施，以恢复失活催化剂的活性。
