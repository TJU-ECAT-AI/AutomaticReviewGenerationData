1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress surface carbon and prevent coking, as well as the development of alternative catalysts with high resistance to coking.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来形成丙烯的丙烯生产方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在确定过程的效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的选择也很关键，铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）是研究最深入和商业化的PDH催化剂。然而，这些催化剂价格昂贵且对环境有害。最近的研究确定了基于廉价和无毒铁基材料的有前途的PDH催化剂，包括由硫酸铝支撑的Fe或Fe2O3，铁硅酸盐沸石，硅胶上的单点Fe原子以及从金属有机框架衍生的碳支持上的铁纳米粒子。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会导致活性和选择性下降，影响过程效率。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用磷酸盐抑制表面碳并防止焦炭形成，以及开发具有高抗焦炭性的替代催化剂。
