1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress coking and maintain activity and selectivity.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来形成丙烯的丙烯生产方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在决定过程的效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的选择也很关键，铂(Pt)和铬(Cr)是PDH研究最深入和商业化的催化剂。然而，这些催化剂既昂贵又对环境有害，导致需要地球丰富的和环境友好的替代催化剂。最近的研究已经确定了基于廉价和无毒的铁基材料的有希望的PDH催化剂，包括由硫酸铝支撑的Fe或Fe2O3，铁硅酸盐沸石，单点Fe原子在二氧化硅上，以及从金属有机框架衍生的碳载体上的铁纳米粒子。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会导致活性和选择性的下降，影响过程效率。抑制焦炭形成的策略包括使用磷酸盐来抑制焦化，以保持活性和选择性。
