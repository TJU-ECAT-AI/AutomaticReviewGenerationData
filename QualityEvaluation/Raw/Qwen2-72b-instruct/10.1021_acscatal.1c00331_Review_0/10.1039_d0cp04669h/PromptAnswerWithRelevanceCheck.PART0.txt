1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most well-studied and commercialized catalysts for PDH. However, these catalysts are expensive and environmentally hazardous, respectively, leading to a need for earth-abundant and environmentally-benign alternative catalysts. Recent research has identified promising PDH catalysts based on inexpensive and non-toxic iron-based materials, including Fe or Fe2O3 supported by sulfated alumina, iron-silica zeolites, single-site Fe atoms on silica, and iron nanoparticles derived from metalorganic frameworks on carbon supports. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of phosphate to suppress coking and maintain activity and selectivity.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来形成丙烯的丙烯生产方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在决定过程的效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的选择也很关键，铂(Pt)和铬(Cr)是PDH研究最深入和商业化的催化剂。然而，这些催化剂既昂贵又对环境有害，导致需要地球丰富的和环境友好的替代催化剂。最近的研究已经确定了基于廉价和无毒的铁基材料的有希望的PDH催化剂，包括由硫酸铝支撑的Fe或Fe2O3，铁硅酸盐沸石，单点Fe原子在二氧化硅上，以及从金属有机框架衍生的碳载体上的铁纳米粒子。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会导致活性和选择性的下降，影响过程效率。抑制焦炭形成的策略包括使用磷酸盐来抑制焦化，以保持活性和选择性。

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) traditionally used due to their high activity and selectivity. However, these metals can be expensive and toxic, leading to a search for alternative, earth-abundant, and environmentally benign catalysts. Iron-based materials, including iron carbides, have shown promise as potential catalysts for PDH. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity over time, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of promoters, such as phosphate, which can stabilize the catalyst surface and prevent the accumulation of coke. Catalyst regeneration techniques, such as thermal treatment under an oxidizing atmosphere, can also be employed to remove coke and restore catalyst activity.
