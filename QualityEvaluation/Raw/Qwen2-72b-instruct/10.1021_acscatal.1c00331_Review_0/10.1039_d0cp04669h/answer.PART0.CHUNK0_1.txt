1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The choice of catalyst is also critical, with metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) traditionally used due to their high activity and selectivity. However, these metals can be expensive and toxic, leading to a search for alternative, earth-abundant, and environmentally benign catalysts. Iron-based materials, including iron carbides, have shown promise as potential catalysts for PDH. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity over time, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of promoters, such as phosphate, which can stabilize the catalyst surface and prevent the accumulation of coke. Catalyst regeneration techniques, such as thermal treatment under an oxidizing atmosphere, can also be employed to remove coke and restore catalyst activity.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在决定过程的效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的选择也很关键，传统上使用像铂(Pt)和铬(Cr)这样的金属，因为它们具有高活性和选择性。然而，这些金属可能既昂贵又有毒，导致寻找替代的、丰富的、环境友好的催化剂。铁基材料，包括铁碳化物，已经显示出作为PDH潜在催化剂的前景。在基于Pt的催化剂上形成焦炭会导致随时间推移活性和选择性下降，影响过程效率。缓解焦炭形成的战略包括使用促进剂，如磷酸盐，它可以稳定催化剂表面，防止焦炭的积累。催化剂再生技术，如在氧化气氛下进行热处理，也可以用于去除焦炭，恢复催化剂活性。
