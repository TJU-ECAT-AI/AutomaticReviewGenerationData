          "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."

"The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."

"Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."

"Larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions."

"Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

"The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials,air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs."

"The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990."

"STAR catalyst (PtSn on ZnCa aluminate) is based on zinc aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various metals, and exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance,and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate."

"In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

"Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."

"As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."

"Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."

"A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."

"In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."

"Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface."

"The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

"In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a highly endothermic reaction. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane. However, these conditions must be carefully regulated to inhibit side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and productivity.

The most commonly used catalysts for PDH are platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which show excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness. However, they have a high tendency for coking and sintering, and their high cost requires the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, support, and promoter effects.

Industrial applications of PDH include several processes:

1. The Catofin process, which uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials (air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward), allowing for more products to be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs.

2. The Oleflex process, which converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors. This process was commercialized in 1990.

3. The STAR process, which uses a PtSn catalyst on zinc aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various metals. This catalyst exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate.

Key considerations for PDH include managing the endothermic nature of the reaction, controlling reaction conditions to minimize side reactions, and developing catalysts that balance activity, selectivity, and stability while minimizing coking and sintering.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts the process efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by causing catalyst deactivation through two main mechanisms:

1. Poisoning of active sites
2. Limiting access of reactants to active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke

The formation of coke is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures of the catalyst. Factors that influence coke formation include the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene on the catalyst surface.

Several strategies can be implemented to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Facilitating propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene
2. Separating active metal components to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions
3. Increasing the electron density of Pt particles to weaken Pt-C bonds and inhibit coke precursors
4. Modifying acidic supports to reduce coke formation and suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules
5. Increasing hydrogen pressure to lower the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface
6. Enhancing oxygen mobility to oxidize adsorbed surface carbonaceous species
7. Transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports to prolong catalyst life

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, maintain high propylene selectivity, and extend the operational lifetime of the catalyst. The design of catalysts with specific reaction ensembles and the careful control of reaction conditions are crucial for optimizing the PDH process and minimizing coke formation.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过高度吸热反应将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在决定过程效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。提高反应温度和/或降低分压有助于提高丙烷的转化率。然而，这些条件必须仔细调节，以抑制副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和产量。

PDH最常用的催化剂是铂(Pt)基催化剂，由于其对烷基CH键的亲和力和环境友好性，它们在丙烷脱氢方面表现出优异的活性。然而，它们有很高的结焦和烧结倾向，而且高昂的成本需要通过特殊制备方法、载体和促进剂效应来开发低Pt含量和稳定的Pt基催化剂。

PDH的工业应用包括几个过程：

1. Catofin工艺，使用逆流技术改变反应物料的流向（空气向下，烃类直接向上），从而以较少的原料获得更多的产品，降低投资和运营成本。

2. Oleflex工艺，通过移动床反应器中的催化脱氢将丙烷转化为丙烯。该工艺于1990年实现商业化。

3. STAR工艺，使用锌铝酸盐和钙载体上的PtSn催化剂，并浸渍各种金属。该催化剂在几乎平衡的转化率下表现出优异的脱氢性能和高选择性。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括管理反应的吸热性质，控制反应条件以最小化副反应，以及开发在平衡活性、选择性和稳定性的同时最小化结焦和烧结的催化剂。

在Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活显著影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的效率，主要通过两种机制：

1. 毒化活性位点
2. 由于焦炭部分或完全堵塞孔隙而限制反应物接触活性位点

焦炭的形成本质上由催化剂的表面几何和电子结构决定。影响焦炭形成的因素包括丙烯在催化剂表面的吸附构型和强度。

可以实施几种策略来减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生：

1. 促进丙烯脱附和增加丙烯脱氢的能垒
2. 分离活性金属组分以抑制结构敏感的副反应
3. 增加Pt颗粒的电子密度以削弱Pt-C键并抑制焦炭前体
4. 改性酸性载体以减少焦炭形成并抑制反应分子的扩散
5. 增加氢气压力以降低表面深度脱氢焦炭前体的覆盖率
6. 提高氧的移动性以氧化吸附在表面的碳质物种
7. 将焦炭前体从Pt转移到载体上以延长催化剂寿命

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，保持高丙烯选择性，并延长催化剂的操作寿命。设计具有特定反应集合的催化剂和仔细控制反应条件对于优化PDH过程和最小化焦炭形成至关重要。
