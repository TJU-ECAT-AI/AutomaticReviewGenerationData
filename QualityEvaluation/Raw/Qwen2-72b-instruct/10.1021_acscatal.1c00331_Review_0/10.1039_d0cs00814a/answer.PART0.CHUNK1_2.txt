[1] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm."
[2] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[3] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[4] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[5] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[6] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[7] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[8] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[9] "As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[10] "In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[11] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface."
[12] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[13] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."

1.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Pt-based catalysts are commonly used due to their high activity for PDH. However, the efficiency of the process can be impacted by coke formation on the catalyst surface, which can lead to deactivation and decreased selectivity. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts is influenced by the size of the metal particles, with smaller particles being more susceptible to coke formation due to the higher fraction of under-coordinated atoms. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include geometric separation of active metal components, electron richness of the catalyst surface, poisoning of acidic sites on the support, co-feeding of hydrogen or carbon dioxide, enhancing oxygen mobility, and transferring coke precursors from the metal surface to the support.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by decreasing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The deactivation rate constant (kd) is used to evaluate the stability of the catalyst, with a higher kd value indicating faster deactivation and lower stability. Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, leading to a decrease in activity on smaller nanoparticles. The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition. In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity through two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.

1.催化直接脱氢反应是丙烷转化为丙烯的一种方法，通过从丙烷中去除氢原子来实现。反应条件，如温度和压力，在决定过程的效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。由于其对PDH的高活性，通常使用基于Pt的催化剂。然而，催化剂表面的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活和选择性降低。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成受金属颗粒大小的影响，较小的颗粒由于具有较高比例的未配位原子而更容易形成焦炭。抑制焦炭形成的策略包括活性金属组分的几何分离、催化剂表面的电子丰富性、支持物上酸性位点的中毒、氢气或二氧化碳的共馈、增强氧流动性以及从金属表面向支持物转移焦炭前体。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率，通过降低催化剂的活性和选择性。失活速率常数(kd)用于评估催化剂的稳定性，kd值越高，表明失活越快，稳定性越低。焦炭优先覆盖表面未配位的活性位点，导致较小颗粒上的活性降低。丙烯的脱氢产物C3H5*可以作为焦炭沉积的模型前体。在PDH反应中，Pt基催化剂上的焦化行为通过两种机制导致催化活性降低：中毒活性位点或由于焦炭部分或完全堵塞孔隙而限制反应物对活性位点的访问。抑制焦炭形成的策略包括活性金属组分的几何分离、催化剂表面的电子丰富性、支持物上酸性位点的中毒、氢气或二氧化碳的共馈、增强氧流动性以及从金属表面向支持物转移焦炭前体。
