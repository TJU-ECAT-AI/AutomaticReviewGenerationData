[1] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm."
[2] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[3] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[4] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[5] "In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys."
[6] "The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the cata- lytic performance."
[7] "Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement."
[8] "A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports,metals and treatments (Fig. 12b)."
[9] "In the following sections, we Fig. 12 The deactivation and inhibition strategies over Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. (a) The main deactivation phenomena are shown. (b) The approaches for inhibiting deactivation are shown and divided after the different modification stages of supports, metal particles and treatment."
[10] "3.1.3.1 Coke formation"
[11] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[12] "As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[13] "It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations.134 Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[14] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[15] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi- fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[16] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[17] "TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively."
[18] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.133"
[19] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[20] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[21] "Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[22] "Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration."
[23] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[24] "3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation. Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[25] "For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44 The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[26] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke (Fig. 13a and b)."
[27] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC inter- actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[28] "For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135"
[29] "In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136"
[30] "3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness. As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor."
[31] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[32] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[33] "Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics,and in situ X-ray spectroscopies."
[34] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42"
[35] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms.72"
[36] "3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites. In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[37] "Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports."
[38] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[39] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[40] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[41] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[42] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021 Chem. Soc. Rev., 2021, 50, 33153354  3335 Chem Soc Rev Review Article Published on 25 January 2021. Downloaded by University of California - Santa Barbara on 5/16/2021 10:10:53 PM."
[43] "View Article Online and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[44] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[45] "3.1.3.1.5 Co-feeding streams. In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[46] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138"
[47] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[48] "Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[49] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139"
[50] "3.1.3.1.6 Enhancing oxygen mobility. The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[51] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[52] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140"
[53] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[54] "3.1.3.1.7 Coke transfer. In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[55] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[56] "Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72"
[57] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[58] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[59] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."
[60] "3.1.3.2 Catalyst sintering"
[61] "3.1.3.2.1 Sintering mechanism. As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway."
[62] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[63] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[64] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[65] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti- cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.141"

[112] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[113] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[114] "Although many efforts have been made,further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamics, with the equilibrium conversion of propane being around 20% at 600°C. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and contact time, play a crucial role in determining the yield and selectivity of propene. The reaction is typically carried out over a metal or metal oxide-based catalyst, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most commonly used metals. The Pt-based catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity, but they are also prone to deactivation due to coke formation. The Cr-based catalysts, on the other hand, are less expensive but have lower selectivity and are more prone to environmental issues due to the toxicity of Cr.
2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a decrease in activity and selectivity over time. The coke, which is a carbonaceous deposit, covers the active sites of the catalyst, preventing the reactants from reaching the surface and undergoing the dehydrogenation reaction. This leads to a decrease in the conversion of propane and the yield of propene. The coke formation can also lead to sintering of the Pt nanoparticles, which further reduces the activity of the catalyst. To mitigate the formation of coke and improve the catalyst regeneration, several strategies can be implemented. These include the use of non-acidic supports, such as silica or alumina, which can reduce the formation of coke by suppressing the cracking and polymerization reactions. The addition of promoters, such as tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn), can also help to inhibit the coke formation by altering the electronic properties of the Pt and reducing the reactivity towards the side reactions. The use of co-feeding streams, such as hydrogen or carbon dioxide, can also help to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts. The hydrogen can reduce the coverage of coke precursors on the surface, while the carbon dioxide can act as a soft oxidant and reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperatures via the reverse Boudouard reaction.

1. 催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。该反应是吸热的，受热力学限制，丙烷在600°C时的平衡转化率约为20%。反应条件，如温度、压力和接触时间，在确定丙烯产量和选择性方面起着关键作用。该反应通常在金属或金属氧化物基催化剂上进行，铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）是最常用的金属。Pt基催化剂以其高活性和选择性而闻名，但它们也容易因焦炭形成而失活。Cr基催化剂，另一方面，成本较低，但选择性较低，由于Cr的毒性，更容易出现环境问题。
2. Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过随时间降低活性和选择性影响过程效率。焦炭，一种碳沉积物，覆盖催化剂的活性位点，阻止反应物到达表面并进行脱氢反应。这导致丙烷转化率和丙烯产量的降低。焦炭形成还可能导致Pt纳米颗粒的烧结，进一步降低催化剂的活性。为了抑制焦炭的形成并改善催化剂再生，可以实施几种策略。这些包括使用非酸性载体，如二氧化硅或氧化铝，可以减少焦炭的形成，通过抑制裂解和聚合反应。添加促进剂，如锡（Sn）或锌（Zn），也可以通过改变Pt的电子性质并降低对副反应的反应性来帮助抑制焦炭的形成。使用共馈流，如氢气或二氧化碳，也可以帮助去除焦炭并重新激活催化剂。氢气可以降低表面焦炭前体的覆盖度，而二氧化碳可以作为温和的氧化剂，在高温下通过逆Boudouard反应减少焦炭的形成。
