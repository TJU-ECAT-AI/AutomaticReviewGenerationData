[1] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm."
[2] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[3] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[4] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[5] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[6] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[7] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[8] "In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[9] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[10] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[11] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[12] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it."
[13] "Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."
[14] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."
[15] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[16] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138"
[17] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[18] "Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[19] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139"
[20] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[21] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[22] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140"
[23] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[24] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[25] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[26] "Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72"
[27] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[28] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[29] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Catalyst types, particularly Pt-based catalysts, are essential for enhancing the reaction rate and selectivity towards propene. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemical products.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a decrease in catalytic activity and selectivity. Coke acts as a barrier, preventing reactants from reaching the active sites of the catalyst, leading to a reduction in the reaction rate. Additionally, coke formation can lead to the deactivation of the catalyst, requiring regeneration or replacement, which increases the overall cost of the process.
3.Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of non-acidic supports, such as alumina, which can reduce the formation of coke precursors and improve the stability of the catalyst. The addition of promoters, such as alkali metals, can also help to poison acid sites and reduce the formation of coke. Cofeeding streams, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination. Hydrogen can reduce the coverage of coke precursors and promote the desorption of propene, while carbon dioxide can act as a soft oxidant and reduce the amount of coke formed on the catalysts. The use of ceria as a support can also enhance the oxygen mobility and storage capacity, leading to improved desorption of propene and inhibition of deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过去除氢原子将丙烷转化为丙烯的方法。反应条件，如温度和压力，在确定过程效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂类型，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，对于提高反应速率和选择性向丙烯至关重要。PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯用于制造塑料、洗涤剂和其他化学产品。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化活性和选择性影响过程效率。焦炭作为屏障，阻止反应物到达催化剂的活性位点，导致反应速率降低。此外，焦炭形成会导致催化剂失活，需要再生或更换，这会增加过程的总体成本。
3.减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用非酸性载体，如氧化铝，可以减少焦炭前体的形成，提高催化剂的稳定性。添加促进剂，如碱金属，也可以帮助毒化酸位点，减少焦炭的形成。共馈流，如氢气和二氧化碳，也可以对焦炭消除产生积极影响。氢气可以减少焦炭前体的覆盖，促进丙烯的解吸，而二氧化碳可以作为温和的氧化剂，减少催化剂上焦炭的形成。使用铈作为载体也可以增强氧的流动性和储存能力，从而改善丙烯的解吸，抑制深度脱氢和焦炭的形成。
