          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
          [2] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [3] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [4] "Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions."
          [5] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [6] "In this section, we will summarize the current PDH catalysts and their application."
          [7] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [8] "The difficulties mainly stem from the structural complexity of supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation processes."
          [9] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."
          [10] "In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity."
          [11] "While propylene is more active and can more easily undergo complex side reactions, such as further dehydrogenation and cracking."
          [12] "The main problems of Pt particles are CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation."
          [13] "Meanwhile, high temperatures during the dehydrogenation and regeneration induce severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles mainly through the Ostwald ripening mechanism (the Tammann temperature is 750 1C for platinum)."
          [14] "Therefore, although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."
          [15] "The different preparation methods and metal loadings may contribute to the different structures."
          [16] "The possible structures of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7b."
          [17] "The debate details are summarized as follows: (i) the chemical states of Sn, the metallic state, oxidation state or coexistence of Sn0 and Snx+ (0 o x r 4), (ii) the chemical states of Pt, (iii) coke mechanisms, and (iv) redispersion behaviors in the regeneration process."
          [18] "In addition to promoters, good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under harsh dehydrogenation and regeneration conditions."
          [19] "Their textural properties such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."
          [20] "For example, to avert the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled."
          [21] "Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."
          [22] "An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2."
          [23] "The comparison of the different catalysts is based on the propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Pt per hour at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction as a function of the deactivation rate."
          [24] "Because of propane dehydrogenation as a structure-insensitive reaction, all Pt atoms on the surface are active for propane dehydrogenation."
          [25] "It is difficult to calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) because Pt dispersion values in different catalysts were not given."
          [26] "Additionally, to determine the stability of different catalysts, we calculated the deactivation rate (kd), based on a first-order deactivation mechanism."
          [27] "The propylene formation rate as a function of the deactivation rate for the representative Pt-based catalysts is shown in Fig. 8."
          [28] "We can find that the propylene formation rates of the most Pt-based catalysts are about 5 mol gpt 1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.05 h1."
          [29] "However, the catalysts life and Pt loadings are 10 h and 0.51 wt% in the references, which are far away from the industrial application."

          Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production that has received extensive attention in recent years. The reaction is highly endothermic, and increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane. However, increasing the temperature also increases the rates of side reactions such as cracking to ethylene and methane. Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and productivity. Larger particles can lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, hydrogenation, and coke formation, which pose great challenges to dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design. Current PDH catalysts and their applications are summarized in the literature. Although Pt catalysts show excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, their high tendency to coking and sintering, as well as high cost, require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts. The structural complexity of supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation processes contribute to the difficulties in understanding the active sites and reaction mechanisms of Pt-based catalysts.
