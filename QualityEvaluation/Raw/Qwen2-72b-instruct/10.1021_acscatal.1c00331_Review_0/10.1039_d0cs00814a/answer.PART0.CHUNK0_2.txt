[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
[3] "By increasing the temperature, the rates of both the CH cleavage and competitive CC cleavage side reactions, such as cracking to ethylene and methane (eqn (2)), are increased (Fig. 2b)."
[4] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
[5] "Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions."
[6] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
[7] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[10] "Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[11] "Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."
[12] "Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface."
[13] "As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of attention."

[16] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41,78 are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition."
[17] "Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media."
[18] "Zhen Zhao and coworkers found that graphene doped with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production that has received extensive attention in recent years. The reaction is highly endothermic, and increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane. However, increasing the temperature also increases the rates of side reactions such as cracking to ethylene and methane. Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and productivity. Larger particles can lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, hydrogenation, and coke formation, which pose great challenges to dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
2.Pt-based catalysts show excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness. However, they have a high tendency to coking and sintering, and high cost. Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired. Regulating the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions. Supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred to increase the dispersion of metal particles. Alkaline metals such as Li, Na, and K can help poison strong acid sites and avoid coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Modified Al2O3 and alternative supports have attracted attention during the dehydrogenation reaction. Other oxide supports such as SiO2, CeO2, and zeolites have been further developed. Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels, and mesoporous materials such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41 are often used as catalyst supports. Carbon materials have been widely used due to their large surface area, chemical inertness, and stability in acidic/basic media. Graphene doped with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance. Supports can change selectivity by influencing the component, morphology, and distribution of metal particles, and alter reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering, and anti-coking resistance. However, the catalysts' life and Pt loadings are far from industrial application.
3.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts process efficiency by decreasing catalyst activity and selectivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using modified Al2O3 and alternative supports, regulating the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters, and increasing the dispersion of metal particles on supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution. Alkaline metals such as Li, Na, and K can help poison strong acid sites and avoid coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface. Other oxide supports such as SiO2, CeO2, and zeolites have been further developed. Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels, and mesoporous materials such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41 are often used as catalyst supports.

Graphene doped with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance. Supports can change selectivity by influencing the component, morphology, and distribution of metal particles, and alter reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering, and anti-coking resistance. Improving catalyst regeneration involves developing low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术,近年来受到广泛关注。该反应高度吸热,提高反应温度和/或降低分压有助于提高丙烷转化率。然而,提高温度也会增加裂解为乙烯和甲烷等副反应的速率。因此,应调节反应条件和反应动力学,以抑制副反应,提高丙烯选择性和生产力。大颗粒会导致氢解、裂解、氢化和焦炭形成等副反应,这对脱氢技术和催化剂设计构成了巨大挑战。
2.铂基催化剂由于对烷基CH键的亲和力和环境友好性,在丙烷脱氢中表现出优异的活性。然而,它们有很高的焦炭和烧结倾向,成本高昂。开发低或非铬含量的替代金属氧化物催化剂是高度期望的。调节铂和氧化物促进剂之间的相互作用对PDH反应至关重要。为了增加金属颗粒的分散度,优选具有高表面积和均匀孔径分布的载体。碱金属如锂、钠和钾可以帮助毒化强酸位点,避免在Al2O3表面沉积焦炭。在脱氢反应过程中,使用改性Al2O3和替代载体引起了广泛关注。除了基于Al2O3的载体,其他氧化物载体如SiO2、CeO2和沸石也得到了进一步发展。Pt可以嵌入具有特殊三维通道的沸石中,如Pt@KA(LTA型沸石)和Pt@ZSM-5(MFI型沸石),具有独特的物理性质。此外,如SBA-1561和MCM-41等介孔材料通常用作催化剂载体。碳材料由于其大表面积、化学惰性和在酸性/碱性介质中的稳定性,已被广泛用于多种反应。Zhen Zhao等人发现,用吡啶氮掺杂的石墨烯是增强Pt催化性能最有效的载体。载体不仅可以影响组分、形态和金属颗粒分布,从而改变选择性,还可以通过增加机械强度、抗烧结和抗焦炭性,改变反应稳定性。然而,催化剂的寿命和Pt负载量远未达到工业应用水平。
3.铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响过程效率,降低催化剂活性和选择性。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用改性Al2O3和替代载体,调节铂和氧化物促进剂之间的相互作用,以及在具有高表面积和均匀孔径分布的载体上增加金属颗粒的分散度。碱金属如锂、钠和钾可以帮助毒化强酸位点,避免在Al2O3表面沉积焦炭。其他氧化物载体如SiO2、CeO2和沸石也得到了进一步发展。Pt可以嵌入具有特殊三维通道的沸石中,如SBA-1561和MCM-41等介孔材料通常用作催化剂载体。碳材料由于其大表面积、化学惰性和在酸性/碱性介质中的稳定性,已被广泛用于多种反应。Zhen Zhao等人发现,用吡啶氮掺杂的石墨烯是增强Pt催化性能最有效的载体。载体不仅可以影响组分、形态和金属颗粒分布,从而改变选择性,还可以通过增加机械强度、抗烧结和抗焦炭性,改变反应稳定性。改善催化剂再生涉及通过特殊制备方法开发低Pt含量和稳定的铂基催化剂,以及载体和促进剂效应。
