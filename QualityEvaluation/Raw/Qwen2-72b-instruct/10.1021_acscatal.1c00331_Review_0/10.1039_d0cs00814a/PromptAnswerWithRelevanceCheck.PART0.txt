Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions,undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation.
The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm.
The activation energy is not constant with the progression of the Fig. 11c.
The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced.
The intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking,as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking,contributing to the formation of side products like ethane,methane and coke.
Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles.
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.
Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously.
As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
Propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO).
The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well.
The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke.
Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC inter- actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions.
A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity.
The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).
In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms.
Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports.
However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K.
Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).
More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h).
In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.
The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.
The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i).
Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.
In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
The drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.
However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation.
In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles.
The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters.
Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti- cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.
In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other.
To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide.
Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a).
The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 1C.
Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c).
In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions.
The confinement situation offered by a sup- port can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering.
The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhib- ited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 1C.
Compared with Al2O3 supports (Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protec- tive effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f).
In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect.
Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4 1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation.
Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiffzeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles.
Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innova- tive approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions.
High temperature oxidation reduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm.
A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure.
After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).
Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@ MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
Regenerating catalysts under oxi- dizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts.
Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural trans- formation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.
Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.
However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration.
In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres.
Although many efforts have been made,further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved.

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamics, with the equilibrium conversion of propane to propene typically around 30-40% at high temperatures. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the temperature, pressure, and residence time, with higher temperatures and pressures favoring higher conversion rates but also increasing the likelihood of side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The most commonly used catalysts for PDH are platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which have high activity and selectivity for propene production. However, these catalysts are prone to deactivation due to coke formation, which can cover the active sites and limit access of reactants to the catalyst surface.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by decreasing the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Coke is formed through the deep dehydrogenation of propene and propane, which results in the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. These carbon deposits can cover the active sites of the catalyst, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Additionally, the formation of coke can lead to the blocking of pores in the catalyst, further limiting access of reactants to the active sites. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies such as increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propene, facilitating propylene desorption, and inhibiting the formation of propylidyne intermediates can be implemented. These strategies can help to reduce the formation of coke and improve the stability and performance of the catalyst.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years.
The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a.
Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity.
Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions.
These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
In this section, we will briefly introduce the basic operating procedures and applied catalysts,which are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1.
The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials,air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs.
The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990.
The pre-treated C3 LPG feedstock is introduced into the depropanizer. Butane or heavy components in C3 LPG are discharged from the bottom of the depropanizer.
The top of the depropanizer is fed to the C3 Oleflex unit to produce propylene rich liquid products and hydrogen-rich gas products.
The net hydrogen can be exported directly for modification of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or as a fuel in the unit.
Oleflex dehydrogenation units can be easily integrated with downstream conversion processes, such as alkylation,to produce high-octane alkylation oils, or isobutylene dimerization,followed by hydrogenation to produce high-octane isooctane.
This combination is called as a UOP indirect alkylation (InAlkTM) process.
The feed flow is that, first, the feed gas flows into the reaction tower, and then the catalyst powder and product gas are separated by the cyclone separator.
Afterward, the product gas is compressed and subsequently separated to obtain the targeted propylene gas.
Additionally, the catalyst with carbon deposition on the surface is transported to the regeneration tower (700 1C).
The heat generated by the roasting is used as the reactor heat source.
The generated catalyst is then transferred to the reaction tower for the next propane dehydrogenation cycle.
The latest dehydrogenation catalysts focus on platinumtin catalysts with excellent selec- tivity and activity.
The multi-tube fixed bed reactor operates at 550650 1C and catalysts are periodically regenerated with air.
Under isothermal operation, the process can achieve more than 90% propylene selectivity.
The catalyst life can exceed two years due to the reduced coke accumulation and low deactiva- tion rates.
The high conversion rates and simple fixed-bed reactor design result in less equipment and therefore less investment.
In addition, operating above atmospheric pressure provides higher safety standards than other technologies.
In the oxidative dehydrogenation section, oxygen is introduced into the reactor,where it reacts with some hydrogen products to form H2O.
This reverses the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, thus increasing the conversion rate.
In addition, the formation of H2O is an exothermic reaction, thus providing additional heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.
STAR catalyst (PtSn on ZnCa aluminate) is based on zinc aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various metals, and exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance,and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate.
The catalyst is very stable in the presence of steam at high temperatures, providing a unique advantage to the process.
It has been commercially validated and shows a life span of more than 5 years.
The STAR process has the highest spatial yield of all PDH technologies and operates at a reactor outlet pressure of approximately 5.8 bar, allowing for a higher compressor suction pressure, which significantly reduces the investment and operating expenses associated with coarse gas compression.
This dehydrogenation technology is operated with a non-toxic,non-corrosive and non-noble metal oxide catalyst, in a highly efficient circulating fluidized bed reactor, and involves burning the catalyst to regeneration for continuous dehydrogenation reaction.
The ADHO technology has the following characteristics,where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearseni- fication and other complex technical processes.
The reaction and catalyst regeneration are carried out continuously with high production efficiency.
The catalyst is non-toxic with no pollution to the environment and non-corrosive, and is con- ducive to the safe and stable operation of the device over a long period.
Additionally, the catalyst exhibits high mechanical strength and low agent consumption.
It is not only suitable for dehydrogenation of propane and butane alone, but also for dehydrogenation of mixed propane and butane.
The results of the industrialization test in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited show that the single-pass conversion rates of alkanes, and the yields and selectivities of alkenes are comparable to the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, which fills the gap in the field of this technology in China.
The optimized catalysts coupled with appropriate dehydrogena- tion and regeneration units achieve approximately 93% propylene selectivity at about 45% propane conversion over K-promoted PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts.
Over 20% capital savings versus other commercial technologies have been achieved largely because of the simplicity of this system.
Moreover, the energy demand per pound of propylene is reduced due to the higher propane conversion at moderate operating pressure.
In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regen- erator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed.
With a concept of using the catalyst to carry heat to the reactor, lower energy requirements and lower CO2 emissions come true.
Besides, the FCDh technology applies a different method from the commercial technologies where the transport of the deactivated catalysts between the dehydrogenation and regeneration units is over shorter periods.
This new technology can be fully integrated with existing ethylene crackers in parallel 3320  Chem. Soc.

Dow is currently promoting this technology on a commer- cial scale in an existing cracker.
The technology can be implemented as a stand-alone propylene production unit inde- pendent of a steam cracker or an FCC unit.
The regeneration is Orthoflow FCC continuous regeneration.
In the K-PROt reaction section, fresh propane and recycled propane are fed into the KBR Orthoflow Converter.
Reaction section effluent gas is then flowed into the compressing unit, low temperature section, and subse- quential PSA and purification sections.
Notably, the K-COTt reactor includes inherent continuous catalyst regeneration and heat input.
The active component of Pt-based catalysts is metal Pt cluster or nanocrystalline.
Xing-Gui Zhou and coworkers, using density functional theory (DFT), showed that the dehydrogenation barrier and desorption barrier of propylene on Pt(111) were similar, and the dehydrogenation barrier (0.29 eV) on Pt(211) was much lower than the desorption barrier of propylene (1.43 eV).
Therefore, the main problems of Pt particles are CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation.
Meanwhile, high temperatures during the dehydrogenation and regeneration induce severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles mainly through the Ostwald ripening mechanism (the Tammann temperature is 750 1C for platinum).
10,39,40 Therefore, although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects.
The different preparation methods and metal loadings may contribute to the different structures (Fig. 6b).
On the one hand, some researchers indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation,which is a structure-sensitive side reaction.
On the other hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich,which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer from Pt sites to the support.
Additionally, DFT calculations are applied to reveal the influence of the Sn promoter for Pt-based catalysts on dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
Yang et al. found that the addition of the Sn promoter contributes to the broadening of the d-band of Pt, which correspondingly downshifts the d-band center of Pt on PtSn surfaces.
Consequently, the PtSn catalysts decrease the energy barrier for propylene desorption and increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation,which lead to the promotion of propylene selectivity.
In addition,it has been recently demonstrated that the Sn species can help in the redispersion of the Pt clusters in the regeneration operation.
Although many studies have established the roles of Sn, the exact active structures under reaction conditions are still under continuing debates.
The possible structures of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7b.
The debate details are summarized as follows: (i) the chemical states of Sn, the metallic state,oxidation state or coexistence of Sn0 and Snx+ (0 o x r 4),(ii) the chemical states of Pt, (iii) coke mechanisms, and (iv) redispersion behaviors in the regeneration process.

Additionally, using supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution can help disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.
4.Pt-based catalysts are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, particularly due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Propane dehydrogenation is a structure-insensitive reaction, for which the kinetics is independent of the particle size of Pt clusters. Assuming that every surface atom is an active site, its reaction rate is directly proportional to the dispersion. Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed Pt atoms decreases, leading to a lower dispersion. Therefore, the development of low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects is highly desired.

The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized.
Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles.
In addition, the high reaction and regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys.
The aforementioned deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the cata- lytic performance.
Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve as an important requirement.
A number of synthetic strategies for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be classified in accordance with the modification of supports,metals and treatments (Fig. 12b).
In the following sections, we Fig. 12 The deactivation and inhibition strategies over Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. (a) The main deactivation phenomena are shown. (b) The approaches for inhibiting deactivation are shown and divided after the different modification stages of supports, metal particles and treatment.
3.1.3.1 Coke formation
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously.
As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
It has been reported that compared to flat surfaces (6372 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) by DFT calculations.134 Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi- fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports.
For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO).
TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst imply that different peaks are consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and disordered coke on the support, respectively.
The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure.133
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation. Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
For example, Gong and coworkers described an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44 The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well.
The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke (Fig. 13a and b).
Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC inter- actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions.
For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals) alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135
In regard to the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136
3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness. As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor.
A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity.
Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics,and in situ X-ray spectroscopies.
The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42
In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms.72
3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites. In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst.
However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K.
Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable.
Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it.
Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021 Chem. Soc.

View Article Online and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent.
This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt.
3.1.3.1.5 Co-feeding streams. In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138
More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h).
Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect.
In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139
3.1.3.1.6 Enhancing oxygen mobility. The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed.
When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140
DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation.
3.1.3.1.7 Coke transfer. In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i).
Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72
Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area.
A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.
But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated.
3.1.3.2 Catalyst sintering
3.1.3.2.1 Sintering mechanism. As discussed above, Pt cluster size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway.
However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation.
In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles.
The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters.
Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti- cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.141

3.1.3.2.2 SMSI on oxide/non-oxide supports. Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide.
Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.
Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a).
The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 1C.
Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c).74
In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions.
Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between plati- num and MXenes.
The results in this case showed that the catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane dehydrogenation.55
3.1.3.2.3 Encapsulation with oxides, carbon layers or meso- porous materials. The confinement situation offered by a sup- port can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering.
The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell could effectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable cata- lytic performances.
The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhib- ited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being Fig. 14 Anti-sintering strategies over Pt-based catalysts.

In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation (Fig. 14d).
Compared with Al2O3 supports (Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protec- tive effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f).142
In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect.
Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4 1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation.
3.1.3.2.4 Fixation in zeolite crystals. Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiffzeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles.
Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innova- tive approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions.
High temperature oxidation reduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm.143
A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure.
A similar situation occurred again.
After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83
As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h.
The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters.
Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@ MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
3.1.3.3 Other deactivation. Regenerating catalysts under oxi- dizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts.
Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural trans- formation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles.144
Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.63
However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration.
In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres.
Although many efforts have been made,further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved.

1. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamics, with the equilibrium conversion of propane being around 20% at 600°C. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and contact time, play a crucial role in determining the yield and selectivity of propene. The reaction is typically carried out over a metal or metal oxide-based catalyst, with platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) being the most commonly used metals. The Pt-based catalysts are known for their high activity and selectivity, but they are also prone to deactivation due to coke formation. The Cr-based catalysts, on the other hand, are less expensive but have lower selectivity and are more prone to environmental issues due to the toxicity of Cr.
2. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a decrease in activity and selectivity over time. The coke, which is a carbonaceous deposit, covers the active sites of the catalyst, preventing the reactants from reaching the surface and undergoing the dehydrogenation reaction. This leads to a decrease in the conversion of propane and the yield of propene. The coke formation can also lead to sintering of the Pt nanoparticles, which further reduces the activity of the catalyst. To mitigate the formation of coke and improve the catalyst regeneration, several strategies can be implemented. These include the use of non-acidic supports, such as silica or alumina, which can reduce the formation of coke by suppressing the cracking and polymerization reactions. The addition of promoters, such as tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn), can also help to inhibit the coke formation by altering the electronic properties of the Pt and reducing the reactivity towards the side reactions. The use of co-feeding streams, such as hydrogen or carbon dioxide, can also help to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts. The hydrogen can reduce the coverage of coke precursors on the surface, while the carbon dioxide can act as a soft oxidant and reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperatures via the reverse Boudouard reaction.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years.
With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging.
The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene.
The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a.
Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity.
Larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions.
These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects.
Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired.
The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials,air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs.
The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990.
The pre-treated C3 LPG feedstock is introduced into the depropanizer. Butane or heavy components in C3 LPG are discharged from the bottom of the depropanizer.
The top of the depropanizer is fed to the C3 Oleflex unit to produce propylene rich liquid products and hydrogen-rich gas products.
The net hydrogen can be exported directly for modification of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or as a fuel in the unit.
Oleflex dehydrogenation units can be easily integrated with downstream conversion processes, such as alkylation,to produce high-octane alkylation oils, or isobutylene dimerization,followed by hydrogenation to produce high-octane isooctane.
This combination is called as a UOP indirect alkylation (InAlkTM) process.
The feed flow is that, first, the feed gas flows into the reaction tower, and then the catalyst powder and product gas are separated by the cyclone separator.
Afterward, the product gas is compressed and subsequently separated to obtain the targeted propylene gas.
Additionally, the catalyst with carbon deposition on the surface is transported to the regeneration tower (700 1C).
The heat generated by the roasting is used as the reactor heat source.
The generated catalyst is then transferred to the reaction tower for the next propane dehydrogenation cycle.
The latest dehydrogenation catalysts focus on platinumtin catalysts with excellent selec- tivity and activity.
The multi-tube fixed bed reactor operates at 550650 1C and catalysts are periodically regenerated with air.
Under isothermal operation, the process can achieve more than 90% propylene selectivity.
The catalyst life can exceed two years due to the reduced coke accumulation and low deactiva- tion rates.
The high conversion rates and simple fixed-bed reactor design result in less equipment and therefore less investment.
In addition, operating above atmospheric pressure provides higher safety standards than other technologies.
In the oxidative dehydrogenation section, oxygen is introduced into the reactor,where it reacts with some hydrogen products to form H2O.
This reverses the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, thus increasing the conversion rate.
In addition, the formation of H2O is an exothermic reaction, thus providing additional heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.
STAR catalyst (PtSn on ZnCa aluminate) is based on zinc aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various metals, and exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance,and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate.
The catalyst is very stable in the presence of steam at high temperatures, providing a unique advantage to the process.
It has been commercially validated and shows a life span of more than 5 years.
Similar techniques can achieve acceptable yields at pressures close to atmospheric pressure or even lower (in a vacuum).
The STAR process has the highest spatial yield of all PDH technologies and operates at a reactor outlet pressure of approximately 5.8 bar, allowing for a higher compressor suction pressure, which significantly reduces the investment and operating expenses associated with coarse gas compression.
The ADHO technology has the following characteristics,where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearseni- fication and other complex technical processes.
The reaction and catalyst regeneration are carried out continuously with high production efficiency.
The catalyst is non-toxic with no pollution to the environment and non-corrosive, and is con- ducive to the safe and stable operation of the device over a long period.
Additionally, the catalyst exhibits high mechanical strength and low agent consumption.
It is not only suitable for dehydrogenation of propane and butane alone, but also for dehydrogenation of mixed propane and butane.
The results of the industrialization test in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited show that the single-pass conversion rates of alkanes, and the yields and selectivities of alkenes are comparable to the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, which fills the gap in the field of this technology in China.
The optimized catalysts coupled with appropriate dehydrogena- tion and regeneration units achieve approximately 93% propylene selectivity at about 45% propane conversion over K-promoted PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts.
Over 20% capital savings versus other commercial technologies have been achieved largely because of the simplicity of this system.
Moreover, the energy demand per pound of propylene is reduced due to the higher propane conversion at moderate operating pressure.
In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regen- erator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed.
With a concept of using the catalyst to carry heat to the reactor, lower energy requirements and lower CO2 emissions come true.
Besides, the FCDh technology applies a different method from the commercial technologies where the transport of the deactivated catalysts between the dehydrogenation and regeneration units is over shorter periods.
This new technology can be fully integrated with existing ethylene crackers in parallel 3320  Chem. Soc.

The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized.
Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.
The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows.
Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
As mentioned above, the empty d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor.
In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface.
The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.

1.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Pt-based catalysts are commonly used due to their high activity for PDH. However, the efficiency of the process can be impacted by coke formation on the catalyst surface, which can lead to deactivation and decreased selectivity. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts is influenced by the size of the metal particles, with smaller particles being more susceptible to coke formation due to the higher fraction of under-coordinated atoms. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include geometric separation of active metal components, electron richness of the catalyst surface, poisoning of acidic sites on the support, co-feeding of hydrogen or carbon dioxide, enhancing oxygen mobility, and transferring coke precursors from the metal surface to the support.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by decreasing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The deactivation rate constant (kd) is used to evaluate the stability of the catalyst, with a higher kd value indicating faster deactivation and lower stability. Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, leading to a decrease in activity on smaller nanoparticles. The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition. In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity through two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include geometric separation of active metal components, electron richness of the catalyst surface, poisoning of acidic sites on the support, co-feeding of hydrogen or carbon dioxide, enhancing oxygen mobility, and transferring coke precursors from the metal surface to the support.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years.
The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a.
By increasing the temperature, the rates of both the CH cleavage and competitive CC cleavage side reactions, such as cracking to ethylene and methane (eqn (2)), are increased (Fig. 2b).
Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity.
Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions.
These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects.
Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired.
Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions.
Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.
Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on the Al2O3 surface.
As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of attention.
In addition to Al2O3-based supports, other oxide supports such SiO2, CeO2 and zeolites have been further developed.
Additionally, Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite) with some unique physical properties.
Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41,78 are often used as the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.
Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media.
Zhen Zhao and coworkers found that graphene doped with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance.
It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.
However, the catalysts life and Pt loadings are 10 h and 0.51 wt% in the references, which are far away from the industrial application.
The reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity.

The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized.
Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.
In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst.
However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K.
Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable.
Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it.
Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent.
This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt.
In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination.
Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138
More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h).
Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect.
In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139
The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability.
As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed.
When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140
DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation.
In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life.
The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i).
Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72
Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area.
A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn.
But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated.

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propene through the removal of hydrogen atoms. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Catalyst types, particularly Pt-based catalysts, are essential for enhancing the reaction rate and selectivity towards propene. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemical products.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by causing a decrease in catalytic activity and selectivity. Coke acts as a barrier, preventing reactants from reaching the active sites of the catalyst, leading to a reduction in the reaction rate. Additionally, coke formation can lead to the deactivation of the catalyst, requiring regeneration or replacement, which increases the overall cost of the process.
3.Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of non-acidic supports, such as alumina, which can reduce the formation of coke precursors and improve the stability of the catalyst. The addition of promoters, such as alkali metals, can also help to poison acid sites and reduce the formation of coke. Cofeeding streams, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, can also have a positive effect on coke elimination. Hydrogen can reduce the coverage of coke precursors and promote the desorption of propene, while carbon dioxide can act as a soft oxidant and reduce the amount of coke formed on the catalysts. The use of ceria as a support can also enhance the oxygen mobility and storage capacity, leading to improved desorption of propene and inhibition of deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years.
With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging.
The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene.
PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product.
The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a.
Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity.
Larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions.
These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects.
The difficulties mainly stem from the structural complexity of supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation processes.
Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges.

3.1.3.1 Coke formation
In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously.
As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition.
In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi- fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports.
For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO).
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important.
Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation.
Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity.
3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness.
A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity.
3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites.
In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst.

Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and is typically carried out at high temperatures (around 600-700°C) over a catalyst. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the temperature, pressure, and residence time of the reactants. Catalyst types commonly used for PDH include platinum-based catalysts, chromium-based catalysts, and vanadium-based catalysts. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for use in the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other petrochemical products.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency of propane dehydrogenation by causing catalyst deactivation. Coke is a carbonaceous material that forms on the catalyst surface during the reaction and can block active sites, reducing the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using a regenerative catalyst system, where the catalyst is periodically removed from the reactor and treated to remove the coke, and using a promoter to modify the catalyst's surface properties and reduce coke formation. Additionally, operating the reactor at lower temperatures and shorter residence times can also help to reduce coke formation.

Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions.
These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
In this section, we will summarize the current PDH catalysts and their application.
Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects.
The difficulties mainly stem from the structural complexity of supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation processes.
Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges.
In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity.
While propylene is more active and can more easily undergo complex side reactions, such as further dehydrogenation and cracking.
The main problems of Pt particles are CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation.
Meanwhile, high temperatures during the dehydrogenation and regeneration induce severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles mainly through the Ostwald ripening mechanism (the Tammann temperature is 750 1C for platinum).
Therefore, although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects.
The different preparation methods and metal loadings may contribute to the different structures.
The possible structures of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7b.
The debate details are summarized as follows: (i) the chemical states of Sn, the metallic state, oxidation state or coexistence of Sn0 and Snx+ (0 o x r 4), (ii) the chemical states of Pt, (iii) coke mechanisms, and (iv) redispersion behaviors in the regeneration process.
In addition to promoters, good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under harsh dehydrogenation and regeneration conditions.
Their textural properties such as specific surface area, acid-base properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts.
For example, to avert the occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled.
Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles, supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred.
An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2.
The comparison of the different catalysts is based on the propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Pt per hour at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction as a function of the deactivation rate.
Because of propane dehydrogenation as a structure-insensitive reaction, all Pt atoms on the surface are active for propane dehydrogenation.
It is difficult to calculate the turnover frequency (TOF) because Pt dispersion values in different catalysts were not given.
Additionally, to determine the stability of different catalysts, we calculated the deactivation rate (kd), based on a first-order deactivation mechanism.
The propylene formation rate as a function of the deactivation rate for the representative Pt-based catalysts is shown in Fig. 8.
We can find that the propylene formation rates of the most Pt-based catalysts are about 5 mol gpt 1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.05 h1.
However, the catalysts life and Pt loadings are 10 h and 0.51 wt% in the references, which are far away from the industrial application.
