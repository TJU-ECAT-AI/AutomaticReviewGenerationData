[1] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm."
[2] "The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a."
[3] "A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability:73 kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t (6) where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h). kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are realized."
[4] "3.1.3.1 Coke formation"
[5] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[6] "As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[7] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[8] "In addition to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi- fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Ptsupport boundary, and on supports."
[9] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[10] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[11] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[12] "Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[13] "3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation."
[14] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[15] "3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness."
[16] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[17] "3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites."
[18] "In addition to the coke on metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress the diffusion of reactive molecules."
[19] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."
[20] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[21] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[22] "3.1.3.1.5 Co-feeding streams."
[23] "In addition to the modulation of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,can also have a positive effect on coke elimination."
[24] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138"
[25] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[26] "Several explanations are suggested:(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."
[27] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139"
[28] "3.1.3.1.6 Enhancing oxygen mobility."
[29] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[30] "As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed."
[31] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced.140"
[32] "DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation and the subsequent coke formation."
[33] "3.1.3.1.7 Coke transfer."
[34] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[35] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[36] "Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72"
[37] "Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit CC bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to supports with large surface area."
[38] "A drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[39] "But until now, the coke transfer pathway has not been directly demonstrated."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and is typically carried out at high temperatures (around 600-700°C) over a catalyst. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the temperature, pressure, and residence time of the reactants. Catalyst types commonly used for PDH include platinum-based catalysts, chromium-based catalysts, and vanadium-based catalysts. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for use in the manufacture of plastics, resins, and other petrochemical products.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency of propane dehydrogenation by causing catalyst deactivation. Coke is a carbonaceous material that forms on the catalyst surface during the reaction and can block active sites, reducing the catalyst's ability to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include using a regenerative catalyst system, where the catalyst is periodically removed from the reactor and treated to remove the coke, and using a promoter to modify the catalyst's surface properties and reduce coke formation. Additionally, operating the reactor at lower temperatures and shorter residence times can also help to reduce coke formation.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。该反应是吸热的，通常在催化剂上以高温(约600-700°C)进行。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括反应物的温度、压力和停留时间。PDH常用的催化剂类型包括铂基催化剂、铬基催化剂和钒基催化剂。PDH的工业应用包括生产丙烯，用于制造塑料、树脂和其他石化产品。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会影响丙烷脱氢过程的效率，导致催化剂失活。焦炭是一种碳质材料，在反应过程中在催化剂表面形成，可以堵塞活性位点，降低催化剂促进脱氢反应的能力。减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用再生催化剂系统，其中催化剂定期从反应器中移除并进行处理以去除焦炭，以及使用促进剂来改变催化剂的表面性质并减少焦炭形成。此外，以较低的温度和较短的停留时间运行反应器也可以帮助减少焦炭形成。
