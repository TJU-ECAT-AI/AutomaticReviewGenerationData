[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
[3] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
[4] "Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation (eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions."
[5] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
[6] "In this section, we will briefly introduce the basic operating procedures and applied catalysts,which are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1."
[7] "The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials,air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs."
[8] "The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990."
[9] "The pre-treated C3 LPG feedstock is introduced into the depropanizer. Butane or heavy components in C3 LPG are discharged from the bottom of the depropanizer."
[10] "The top of the depropanizer is fed to the C3 Oleflex unit to produce propylene rich liquid products and hydrogen-rich gas products."
[11] "The net hydrogen can be exported directly for modification of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or as a fuel in the unit."
[12] "Oleflex dehydrogenation units can be easily integrated with downstream conversion processes, such as alkylation,to produce high-octane alkylation oils, or isobutylene dimerization,followed by hydrogenation to produce high-octane isooctane."
[13] "This combination is called as a UOP indirect alkylation (InAlkTM) process."
[14] "The feed flow is that, first, the feed gas flows into the reaction tower, and then the catalyst powder and product gas are separated by the cyclone separator."
[15] "Afterward, the product gas is compressed and subsequently separated to obtain the targeted propylene gas."
[16] "Additionally, the catalyst with carbon deposition on the surface is transported to the regeneration tower (700 1C)."
[17] "The heat generated by the roasting is used as the reactor heat source."
[18] "The generated catalyst is then transferred to the reaction tower for the next propane dehydrogenation cycle."
[19] "The latest dehydrogenation catalysts focus on platinumtin catalysts with excellent selec- tivity and activity."
[20] "The multi-tube fixed bed reactor operates at 550650 1C and catalysts are periodically regenerated with air."
[21] "Under isothermal operation, the process can achieve more than 90% propylene selectivity."
[22] "The catalyst life can exceed two years due to the reduced coke accumulation and low deactiva- tion rates."
[23] "The high conversion rates and simple fixed-bed reactor design result in less equipment and therefore less investment."
[24] "In addition, operating above atmospheric pressure provides higher safety standards than other technologies."
[25] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation section, oxygen is introduced into the reactor,where it reacts with some hydrogen products to form H2O."
[26] "This reverses the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, thus increasing the conversion rate."
[27] "In addition, the formation of H2O is an exothermic reaction, thus providing additional heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[28] "STAR catalyst (PtSn on ZnCa aluminate) is based on zinc aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various metals, and exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance,and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate."
[29] "The catalyst is very stable in the presence of steam at high temperatures, providing a unique advantage to the process."
[30] "It has been commercially validated and shows a life span of more than 5 years."
[31] "The STAR process has the highest spatial yield of all PDH technologies and operates at a reactor outlet pressure of approximately 5.8 bar, allowing for a higher compressor suction pressure, which significantly reduces the investment and operating expenses associated with coarse gas compression."
[32] "This dehydrogenation technology is operated with a non-toxic,non-corrosive and non-noble metal oxide catalyst, in a highly efficient circulating fluidized bed reactor, and involves burning the catalyst to regeneration for continuous dehydrogenation reaction."
[33] "The ADHO technology has the following characteristics,where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearseni- fication and other complex technical processes."

[35] "The catalyst is non-toxic with no pollution to the environment and non-corrosive, and is con- ducive to the safe and stable operation of the device over a long period."
[36] "Additionally, the catalyst exhibits high mechanical strength and low agent consumption."
[37] "It is not only suitable for dehydrogenation of propane and butane alone, but also for dehydrogenation of mixed propane and butane."
[38] "The results of the industrialization test in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited show that the single-pass conversion rates of alkanes, and the yields and selectivities of alkenes are comparable to the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, which fills the gap in the field of this technology in China."
[39] "The optimized catalysts coupled with appropriate dehydrogena- tion and regeneration units achieve approximately 93% propylene selectivity at about 45% propane conversion over K-promoted PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts."
[40] "Over 20% capital savings versus other commercial technologies have been achieved largely because of the simplicity of this system."
[41] "Moreover, the energy demand per pound of propylene is reduced due to the higher propane conversion at moderate operating pressure."
[42] "In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regen- erator technology that allows the process to be scaled as needed."
[43] "With a concept of using the catalyst to carry heat to the reactor, lower energy requirements and lower CO2 emissions come true."
[44] "Besides, the FCDh technology applies a different method from the commercial technologies where the transport of the deactivated catalysts between the dehydrogenation and regeneration units is over shorter periods."

[49] "The regeneration is Orthoflow FCC continuous regeneration."
[50] "In the K-PROt reaction section, fresh propane and recycled propane are fed into the KBR Orthoflow Converter."
[51] "Reaction section effluent gas is then flowed into the compressing unit, low temperature section, and subse- quential PSA and purification sections."
[52] "Notably, the K-COTt reactor includes inherent continuous catalyst regeneration and heat input."
[53] "The active component of Pt-based catalysts is metal Pt cluster or nanocrystalline."
[54] "Xing-Gui Zhou and coworkers, using density functional theory (DFT), showed that the dehydrogenation barrier and desorption barrier of propylene on Pt(111) were similar, and the dehydrogenation barrier (0.29 eV) on Pt(211) was much lower than the desorption barrier of propylene (1.43 eV)."
[55] "Therefore, the main problems of Pt particles are CC cleavage and deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation."
[56] "Meanwhile, high temperatures during the dehydrogenation and regeneration induce severe sintering of Pt nanoparticles mainly through the Ostwald ripening mechanism (the Tammann temperature is 750 1C for platinum)."
[57] "10,39,40 Therefore, although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."
[58] "The different preparation methods and metal loadings may contribute to the different structures (Fig. 6b)."
[59] "On the one hand, some researchers indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation,which is a structure-sensitive side reaction."
[60] "On the other hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich,which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer from Pt sites to the support."
[61] "Additionally, DFT calculations are applied to reveal the influence of the Sn promoter for Pt-based catalysts on dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[62] "Yang et al. found that the addition of the Sn promoter contributes to the broadening of the d-band of Pt, which correspondingly downshifts the d-band center of Pt on PtSn surfaces."
[63] "Consequently, the PtSn catalysts decrease the energy barrier for propylene desorption and increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation,which lead to the promotion of propylene selectivity."
[64] "In addition,it has been recently demonstrated that the Sn species can help in the redispersion of the Pt clusters in the regeneration operation."
[65] "Although many studies have established the roles of Sn, the exact active structures under reaction conditions are still under continuing debates."
[66] "The possible structures of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 7b."
[67] "The debate details are summarized as follows: (i) the chemical states of Sn, the metallic state,oxidation state or coexistence of Sn0 and Snx+ (0 o x r 4),(ii) the chemical states of Pt, (iii) coke mechanisms, and (iv) redispersion behaviors in the regeneration process."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production that has received extensive attention in recent years. The reaction is highly endothermic, and increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures can contribute to higher conversions of propane. However, larger particles can lead to side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, hydrogenation, and coke formation, which pose significant challenges to dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design.
2.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene through a highly endothermic reaction. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, should be regulated to inhibit side reactions and improve propene selectivity and productivity. The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials, air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, to obtain more products with fewer raw materials, reducing investments and operating costs. The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, which was commercialized in 1990. The pre-treated C3 LPG feedstock is introduced into the depropanizer, and butane or heavy components in C3 LPG are discharged from the bottom of the depropanizer. The top of the depropanizer is fed to the C3 Oleflex unit to produce propylene-rich liquid products and hydrogen-rich gas products. The net hydrogen can be exported directly for modification of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or as a fuel in the unit. Oleflex dehydrogenation units can be easily integrated with downstream conversion processes, such as alkylation, to produce high-octane alkylation oils, or isobutylene dimerization, followed by hydrogenation to produce high-octane isooctane. This combination is called the UOP indirect alkylation (InAlkTM) process.
3.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the active sites available for the reaction, leading to decreased propene selectivity and productivity. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using smaller particle sizes to reduce the number of active sites for coke formation, promoting redispersion of Pt clusters during regeneration, and using promoters such as tin to help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, eliminating the sites for coke formation. Additionally, using supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution can help disperse the active phase with more active sites and less coke deposition.
4.Pt-based catalysts are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, particularly due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. Propane dehydrogenation is a structure-insensitive reaction, for which the kinetics is independent of the particle size of Pt clusters. Assuming that every surface atom is an active site, its reaction rate is directly proportional to the dispersion. Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed Pt atoms decreases, leading to a lower dispersion. Therefore, the development of low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects is highly desired.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，近年来受到了广泛关注。该反应高度吸热，提高反应温度和/或降低分压可以促进丙烷的转化。然而，较大的颗粒会导致氢解、裂解、氢化和焦炭形成等副反应，这给脱氢技术及催化剂设计带来了重大挑战。
2.催化直接脱氢的丙烷(PDH)作为丙烯生产的方法，通过将丙烷转化为丙烯的高吸热反应来实现。应调节反应条件，如温度和压力，以抑制副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和产量。Catofin工艺采用逆流技术改变反应物料的流向，空气向下，烃类直接向上，以较少的原料获得更多的产品，从而减少投资和运营成本。Oleflex工艺于1990年商业化，通过催化脱氢在移动床反应器中将丙烷转化为丙烯。预处理的C3 LPG原料被引入脱丙烷器，C3 LPG中的丁烷或重组分从脱丙烷器底部排出。脱丙烷器顶部的物料被送入C3 Oleflex单元，生产富含丙烯的液体产品和富氢气体产品。净氢可以直接用于压力摆动吸附(PSA)的改性，或作为单元的燃料。Oleflex脱氢单元可以轻松地与下游转化过程集成，如烷基化，生产高辛烷值的烷基化油，或异丁烯二聚，随后氢化生产高辛烷值的异辛烷。这种组合被称为UOP间接烷基化(InAlkTM)工艺。
3.在Pt基催化剂上形成焦炭会影响过程效率，通过减少可用于反应的活性位点，导致丙烯选择性和产量降低。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用较小的颗粒尺寸以减少焦炭形成活性位点的数量，促进再生过程中Pt簇的再分散，以及使用锡等促进剂帮助将较大的Pt集合体分离成较小的簇，消除焦炭形成的位点。此外，使用高比表面积和均匀孔径分布的载体有助于分散活性相，提供更多活性位点和更少的焦炭沉积。
4.Pt基催化剂在金属状态下对脱氢反应具有活性，特别是由于它们对烷烃CH键的亲和力。丙烷脱氢是一种结构不敏感的反应，其动力学与Pt簇的粒径无关。假设每个表面原子都是一个活性位点，其反应速率与分散度成正比。虽然小颗粒倾向于在表面上增加活性位点的数量，但暴露的Pt原子的相对分数降低，导致分散度降低。因此，通过促进剂(如金属和氧化物)和载体(氧化物和非氧化物)效应开发低Pt含量和改性Pt基金属催化剂是高度期望的。
