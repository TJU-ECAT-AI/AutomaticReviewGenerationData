[1] "Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions,undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The fraction of certain active sites can be calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles shrinking from B10 to B1 nm."
[3] "The activation energy is not constant with the progression of the Fig. 11c."
[4] "The activation energy differences between the elementary steps of cracking and dehydrogenation are considerably reduced."
[5] "The intermediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is supposed to be the point of origin of CC bond breaking,as the CC bond cleavage is easier than CH bond breaking,contributing to the formation of side products like ethane,methane and coke."
[6] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."
[7] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[8] "Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously."
[9] "As shown above,the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu- rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as CC breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation of carbon deposits."
[10] "Propylidyne intermediates, as precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former."
[11] "The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be taken as a model precursor for coke deposition."
[12] "For Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[13] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[14] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."
[15] "As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."
[16] "Additionally, tuning the supports acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation."
[17] "The effective strategies for inhibiting coke are summarized as follows."
[18] "Previous research studies have shown that separating the active metal components could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved propylene selectivity."
[19] "The interaction between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for CC bond breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well."
[20] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke."
[21] "Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface through a single bond instead of more stable three PtC inter- actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly inhibit the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation side reactions."
[22] "A high electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt(CC) bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena- tion and CC cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity."
[23] "Since the reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic structure and hence the reactivity."
[24] "The modified energy of the Pt 5d electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d)."
[25] "In addition to the alloys, the addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms."
[26] "Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports."
[27] "However, most alumina supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K."
[28] "Zn and Mg with different ratios have also been used to dope the support (Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable."
[29] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy- drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g)."
[30] "More recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h)."
[31] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."
[32] "The oxidation of the adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."
[33] "When the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are enhanced."
[34] "The interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large extent (Fig. 13i)."
[35] "Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi- cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show."
[36] "In addition to inhibiting the coke accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life."
[37] "The drain off effect is proposed to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic sites upon addition of Sn."
[38] "However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suffer from sintering at high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could lead to their permanent deactivation."
[39] "In principle, two aspects cause the sintering of metal particles."
[40] "The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable diameters."
[41] "Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti- cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow."
[42] "In addition, the migrationcoalescence process has also been implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are close to each other."
[43] "To date, many efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes."
[44] "Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical reactions at the metaloxide interface, diffusion, and charge redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide."
[45] "Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a)."
[46] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the reaction temperature to 680 1C."
[47] "Moreover, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of reaction performance (Fig. 14c)."
[48] "In addition to the oxide supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in PDH reactions."
[49] "The confinement situation offered by a sup- port can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."
[50] "The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhib- ited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being maintained up to 700 1C."
[51] "Compared with Al2O3 supports (Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protec- tive effect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f)."
[52] "In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement effect."
[53] "Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is 6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4 1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe sintering during the reduction operation."
[54] "Compared to the encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiffzeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."
[55] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innova- tive approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."
[56] "High temperature oxidation reduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of 1 to 2 nm."
[57] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure."
[58] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."
[59] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@ MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."
[60] "Regenerating catalysts under oxi- dizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."
[61] "Nevertheless, such continuous generation may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural trans- formation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles."
[62] "Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface."
[63] "However, without Sn, Pt may sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration."
[64] "In addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and complex atmospheres."
[65] "Although many efforts have been made,further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and proposals of effective strategies should be achieved."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamics, with the equilibrium conversion of propane to propene typically around 30-40% at high temperatures. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include the temperature, pressure, and residence time, with higher temperatures and pressures favoring higher conversion rates but also increasing the likelihood of side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The most commonly used catalysts for PDH are platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, which have high activity and selectivity for propene production. However, these catalysts are prone to deactivation due to coke formation, which can cover the active sites and limit access of reactants to the catalyst surface.
2.Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by decreasing the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Coke is formed through the deep dehydrogenation of propene and propane, which results in the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. These carbon deposits can cover the active sites of the catalyst, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Additionally, the formation of coke can lead to the blocking of pores in the catalyst, further limiting access of reactants to the active sites. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies such as increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propene, facilitating propylene desorption, and inhibiting the formation of propylidyne intermediates can be implemented. These strategies can help to reduce the formation of coke and improve the stability and performance of the catalyst.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种通过从丙烷中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。该反应是吸热的，受热力学限制，丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率通常在高温下约为30-40%。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和停留时间，其中较高的温度和压力有利于提高转化率，但也增加了副反应和催化剂失活的可能性。PDH中最常用的催化剂是铂(Pt)基催化剂，它们具有高活性和选择性，用于生产丙烯。然而，这些催化剂容易因焦炭形成而失活，焦炭可以覆盖活性位点，限制反应物到达催化剂表面的途径。
2.Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过降低催化剂的活性和选择性，影响过程效率。焦炭是通过丙烯和丙烷的深度脱氢形成的，这导致催化剂表面形成碳沉积物。这些碳沉积物可以覆盖催化剂的活性位点，导致活性和选择性的下降。此外，焦炭的形成可以导致催化剂孔隙的堵塞，进一步限制反应物到达活性位点的途径。为了抑制焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以实施策略，如增加丙烯的脱氢屏障，促进丙烯的解吸，并抑制丙基亚胺中间体的形成。这些策略可以帮助减少焦炭的形成，提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。
