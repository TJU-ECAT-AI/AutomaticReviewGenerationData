          The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.
