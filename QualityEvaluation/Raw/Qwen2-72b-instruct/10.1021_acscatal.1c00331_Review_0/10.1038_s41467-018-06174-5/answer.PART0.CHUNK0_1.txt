1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst, which has been shown to have higher activity and durability compared to Pt-based catalysts. The use of ZrO2 also allows for the regeneration of the catalyst through the removal of carbon deposits, which can contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of the CATOFIN process.
