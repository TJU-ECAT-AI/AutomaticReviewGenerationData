1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules, resulting in the formation of propene and hydrogen. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Typically, PDH is carried out at high temperatures, around 550-625 degrees Celsius, to promote the dehydrogenation reaction. The choice of catalyst is also critical, as it affects the reaction rate and product distribution. The study highlights the use of ZrO2 as a catalyst for PDH, which shows high activity and selectivity towards propene production. The concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size, which in turn affects the catalytic performance. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for the chemical industry, which is a major building block for the manufacture of plastics, detergents, and other chemicals. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency of the PDH process. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, which show higher durability and lower coke formation rates. Additionally, catalyst regeneration techniques, such as oxidative regeneration, can be employed to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）生产丙烯的过程涉及从丙烷分子中去除氢，形成丙烯和氢。反应条件，如温度和压力，在过程效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。通常，PDH在大约550-625摄氏度的高温下进行，以促进脱氢反应。催化剂的选择也很关键，因为它影响反应速率和产品分布。该研究强调了ZrO2作为PDH催化剂的使用，显示出高活性和选择性，倾向于丙烯生产。ZrO2中配位不饱和Zr位点的浓度可以通过调整晶粒尺寸来控制，这反过来又影响催化性能。PDH的工业应用包括为化工行业生产丙烯，这是制造塑料、洗涤剂和其他化学品的主要组成部分。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会导致失活和PDH过程效率降低。缓解焦炭形成的战略包括使用替代催化剂，如ZrO2，显示出更高的耐久性和较低的焦炭形成率。此外，可以采用催化剂再生技术，如氧化再生，以去除焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。
