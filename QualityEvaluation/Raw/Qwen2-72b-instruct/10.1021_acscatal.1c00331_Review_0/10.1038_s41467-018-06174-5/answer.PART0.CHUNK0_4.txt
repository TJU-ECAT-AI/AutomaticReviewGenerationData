1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The type of catalyst used is also a key consideration, with ZrO2 being identified as an effective catalyst for PDH. Industrial applications of PDH include the production of propene for use in the chemical industry. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity of the catalyst and increasing the need for regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of alternative catalysts, such as ZrO2, and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize the formation of coke.
