1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to produce propene is a process that involves the activation of the C-H bond in propane. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the type of catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The study reveals that ZrO2, free of any metals or metal oxides, can be an efficient catalyst for this reaction due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites located at oxygen vacancies. These sites are responsible for the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond in alkanes. The concentration of these active sites can be controlled by adjusting the crystallite size of ZrO2. The use of ZrO2 as a catalyst in PDH offers an industrially relevant and durable alternative to state-of-the-art catalysts containing Pt, CrOx, GaOx, or VOx species. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and decreased efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of ZrO2-based catalysts, which can regenerate in situ through the removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene, and the design of catalysts with optimal crystallite sizes to minimize coke formation and maximize propene selectivity.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）生产丙烯的过程涉及丙烷中C-H键的激活。该过程的效率受所用催化剂类型和反应条件的影响。研究表明，不含任何金属或金属氧化物的ZrO2可以作为这种反应的有效催化剂，因为存在位于氧空位的配位不饱和Zr位点。这些位点负责烷烃中C-H键的同裂。通过调整ZrO2的晶粒尺寸可以控制这些活性位点的浓度。在PDH中使用ZrO2作为催化剂提供了与含Pt、CrOx、GaOx或VOx物种的最先进的催化剂相比，具有工业相关性和耐用性的替代方案。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会导致失活和效率降低。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用ZrO2基催化剂，这些催化剂可以通过丙烷/丙烯去除晶格氧原位再生，以及设计具有最佳晶粒尺寸的催化剂，以最小化焦炭形成并最大化丙烯选择性。
