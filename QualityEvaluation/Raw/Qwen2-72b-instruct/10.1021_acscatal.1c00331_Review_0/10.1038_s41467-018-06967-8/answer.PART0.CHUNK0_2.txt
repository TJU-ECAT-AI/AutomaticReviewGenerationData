1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the use of a catalyst to facilitate the removal of hydrogen from propane, resulting in the formation of propene. Key considerations for this process include the reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, the type of catalyst used, and the efficiency of the process in an industrial setting. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) that can break the scaling relationship between adsorption energies, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and propane conversion. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种通过催化剂促进从丙烷中去除氢，从而形成丙烯的丙烯生产方法。该过程的关键考虑因素包括反应条件，如温度和压力，所用催化剂的类型以及在工业环境中的过程效率。Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成会严重影响过程效率，通过降低催化剂的活性和选择性。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括使用可以打破吸附能标度关系的单原子合金(SAAs)，从而提高丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率。Pt/Cu SAA催化剂，具有分散在铜纳米颗粒上的单个铂原子，在大气压下在520 C下显示出高丙烯选择性(90%)和超过120小时的优异稳定性。
