1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, and the propane-to-nitrogen ratio. The catalyst types play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and activity of the reaction. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can lead to a reduction in selectivity and activity, impacting the process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity and excellent stability under high-temperature conditions.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要工业反应。通常使用PtM合金，如PtSn、PtZn、PtGa、PtIn、PtGe和PtCu作为催化剂。关于反应条件的关键考虑因素包括温度、压力和丙烷与氮气的比例。催化剂类型在决定反应的选择性和活性方面起着关键作用。Pt基催化剂上焦炭的形成会导致选择性和活性的降低，影响过程效率。缓解焦炭形成的策略包括使用单原子合金（SAAs），如Pt/Cu，它可以显著增强表面束缚丙烯的解吸，阻止其进一步脱氢，从而实现高丙烯选择性和在高温条件下优异的稳定性。

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a key industrial reaction for the production of propylene. It is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa, PtIn, PtGe, and PtCu. The reaction conditions typically involve atmospheric pressure, temperatures around 520°C, and a propane-to-nitrogen ratio of 1:1. The selectivity and conversion rate of propane to propylene are crucial considerations. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts can lead to deactivation and reduced efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include using single atom alloys (SAAs) like Pt/Cu, which can maintain high propylene selectivity and stability even after 120 hours on stream. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows excellent stability and anti-coke capability, with a high formation rate of propylene and low deactivation rate.

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the use of a catalyst to facilitate the removal of hydrogen from propane, resulting in the formation of propene. Key considerations for this process include the reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, the type of catalyst used, and the efficiency of the process in an industrial setting. The formation of coke on Pt-based catalysts can significantly impact the process efficiency by reducing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include the use of single atom alloys (SAAs) that can break the scaling relationship between adsorption energies, leading to enhanced propene selectivity and propane conversion. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, with single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles, demonstrates high propene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability under atmospheric pressure at 520 C for more than 120 hours on stream.
