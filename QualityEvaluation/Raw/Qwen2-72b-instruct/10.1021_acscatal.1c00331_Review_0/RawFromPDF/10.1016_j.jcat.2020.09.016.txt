Abstract
The pronounced effect of Sn on RhSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation 
(PDH) is studied. A 0.5 wt% Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Rh(0.5)) without Sn exhibits very low 
propane (C3) conversion (10.7%) and low selectivity (25.4%) for propylene (C3=) at 600 °C 
and a WHSV of 10.8 h-1. However, the Sn addition to Rh(0.5) increases both the C3 conversion 
and C3= yield. Finally, the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst achieves a C3 conversion of 30.8% and a C3= 
selectivity of 96.3%. It has been reported that PtSn catalysts show the optimized C3= at the 
Sn/Pt molar ratio of about 1.0, increasing the propene selectivity at the expense of catalytic 
activity. The RhSn system is not the case. The primary product of Rh(0.5) is methane (65%) at 
the initial time and the severe coke formation covers the exposed Rh metal, resulting in the low 
C3 conversion. Both the C3 conversion and C3= yield increases with increasing the Sn content. 
The low C3 conversion and C3= yield of Rh(0.5) are ascribed to cracking via the strong 
adsorption of intermediates during propane dehydrogenation, resulting in the severe coke 
formation. The main role of Sn on Rh(0.5) for PDH is to suppress cracking of strongly adsorbed 
intermediates during dehydrogenation: the gain of C3= selectivity outweighs the loss of activity 
for propane dehydrogenation to propylene up to the high Sn addition of 3 wt%.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important raw material in many industries, which can be used to 
produce high-value chemicals through polymerization and epoxidation [1-4]. The global 
propylene market is anticipated to significantly grow to 165 million tons by 2030 [5]. Over the 
past few decades, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing novel catalysts to promote 
the industrial applications of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for achieving a more cost-
effective route [6-14]. The primary industrial technologies for PDH are the Catofin process 
(CrO3/Al2O3, CB & I Lummus) and Oleflex (Pt-Sn/Al2O3, UOP) [15,16]. In addition, 
propylene has been produced by steam cracking (SC), methanol to olefin production (MTO) 
and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of light oil fractions [17-19].
Since PDH is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures to 
obtain a high yield of propylene, it is commercially carried out in a temperature range of 450–
650 °C under atmospheric pressure. The c-c bond breakage is kinetically significant only 
through an adsorbed propyne intermediate, to produce methylidyne and ethylidiyne. 
Furthermore, that methylidyne and ethylidyne are both the sources of coke and of C1 and C2 
byproducts [20]. The coke on Pt can be mainly produced via methylidene and ethylidene. 
Therefore, the first step of propane dehydrogenation is dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane 
to propylene via 1-propyl and 2-propyl, and the second step is the desorption of propylene [20-
22]. The side products such as methane, ethane, and coke come from deep dehydrogenation.
PtSn-based catalysts (using different supports) are some of the most popular and 
efficient catalytic systems for PDH. On the other hand, the Sn/SiO2 catalysts without adding 
another metal exhibited the moderate catalytic activity [23-24], but alumina supported KSn 
catalysts gave very low activity [25]. Whereas, Sn combines with Pt (PtSn alloys) provides a 
desirable PDH activities. The addition of Sn not only stabilizes the Pt but also promotes the 
catalytic performance, increasing the propene yield as well as the selectivity [19,26-30]. 
Moreover, Sn plays a promoting role in enhancing the performance of Pt-based catalysts for 
dehydrogenation. Both the geometric and electronic contributions to the promoting role of Sn 
are well understood. The geometric effect results from the isolation of the aggregated Pt 
clusters by the Sn additives, thus substantially reducing the hydrogenolysis and coking 
reactions, leading to high selectivity and stability [31,32]. In addition, electron transfer from Sn 
to Pt increases the electron density of the Pt and decreases the activation energy for the 
desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired reactions and increasing 
the selectivity for olefins [24,33-38].
On the other hand, the DFT study states that Sn can weaken both the propane and 
propylene adsorptions (weakens the binding strengths) and suppress the bond-breaking 
reactions on the Pt surface, leading to lower catalytic activity but a higher selectivity toward 
propylene [39,40]. So, the optimum molar ratio of Sn to Pt for the highest propylene yield was 
observed: (1) Sn addition decreased the dehydrogenation and deep dehydrogenation activity 
weakening the bond strength between Pt and propane or propylene and (2) Sn addition 
increased the selectivity of propylene weakening the propylene adsorption. Moreover, the 
addition of Sn metal on the catalysts leads to the transfer of coke from the metal to the support 
during the reaction [41,42]. In addition, in PtSn bimetals, Sn fills up the 5d band of the Pt metal, 
which suppresses hydrogenolysis and coke formation by decreasing the interaction of the 
hydrocarbon with Pt [16]. It was reported that the Sn to Pt weight ratio on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts 
for PDH was optimized at 1.0-1.5 (Fig. S1 & Table S1). From the observed catalytic 
performance, it was suggested that Pt3Sn1 is the active species for PDH [30,43,44].
Recently, Rh based catalyst such as Rh-Ga have been attempted to find out the better 
alternative [45-50], but the activity and stability of Rh-Ga are not improved as compared with 
PtSn system. 
In this study, we examined the RhSn catalysts which can be a significant alternative for 
bimetallic catalytic system. In contrast to PtSn, there was little activity suppression even with 
excess amount of Sn content on the RhSn catalysts up to 7.5 Sn/Rh weight ratio. The activity 
and selectivity of RhSn increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Furthermore, the catalytic 
performance of the RhSn catalytic system for PDH was similar to or even better than the PtSn 
catalytic system.
2. Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation of the RhSn/𝛾-Al2O3 catalysts
Different amounts of Sn (0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 wt%) were loaded onto 
the 0.5 wt% Rh/𝛾-Al2O3 catalyst via a co-impregnation method, using rhodium chloride 
hydrate (Sigma Co., Ltd., South Korea) and tin chloride dihydrate (Sigma–Aldrich) as 
precursors. The alumina support (2 gram) was stirred with 5 mL ethanol in a 100 mL round 
bottom flask, then the weighed amounts of the Rh and Sn salts, dissolved in 5 mL ethanol, were 
added sequentially to the round bottom flask. After stirring the solution for 5 min, the ethanol 
was removed by evaporation, and the residue was dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 
600 °C for 3 h in air. The prepared RhSn catalysts are designated as Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), where the number in parenthesis indicates the metal 
loading wt% on the prepared RhSn catalysts. For comparison, 0.5 wt% Rh/𝛾-Al2O3 (Rh(0.5)) 
and 0.5 wt% Pt/𝛾-Al2O3 (Pt(0.5)) were prepared as described above.
2.2.
 Characterization of the prepared catalysts 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the calcined and reduced RhSn catalysts were 
recorded on a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα 
radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV and the current 30 mA with a 
scanning rate of 2° min-1. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at -196 °C 
using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.). The Brunauer-
Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods were used to calculate 
the specific surface area and pore size distribution, respectively. Each sample was degassed in 
vacuum at 200 °C for 2 h before the analysis.
The CO chemisorption of the pristine catalysts was performed in a pulse mode (BELCAT, 
BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to the measurements, 0.05 g of the sample was thermally treated under 
a He stream at 500 °C for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. 
The sample was cooled down to room temperature and heated to 600 °C with a heating rate of 
10 °C min-1 in pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL min-1. The sample was then reduced in H2 at 
600 °C for 2 h. After the reduction, the sample was purged with He gas at the same temperature 
for 1 h. After cooling to 50 °C, 10% CO/He gas was introduced for CO chemisorption. The CO 
loop gas was used for each pulse (a sample loop of 1 mL), and the pulse injections were 
repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity 
detector (TCD). The metal dispersion in each catalyst was calculated from the amount of CO 
adsorbed, assuming the stoichiometry factor (SF) for Rh/CO to be 1.0:
Dispersion (%) = 
100 × V𝑠× S𝐹× M𝑊
S𝑊× F𝑛× 22,414
where VS is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight 
of Rh metal (g mol-1), SW is the weight of the sample, and Fn is the Rh fraction in relation to 
the total weight of the catalyst sample. 
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed using a 
temperature program analyzer (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). A calcined sample (0.1 g) was 
placed between quartz wool in a U-type quartz reactor. The sample was heated at 20 °C min-1 
to 500 °C and purged with an Ar stream at 500 °C for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed water 
and other impurities. The catalyst was cooled down to room temperature under Ar gas. After 
this pre-treatment, the catalyst was heated at 10 °C min-1 from room temperature to 900 °C in 
a 5% H2/Ar stream with a flow rate of 30 mL min-1. The consumption of hydrogen was analyzed 
online by TCD.
The morphologies of the prepared catalysts and the γ-Al2O3 samples were observed 
using transmission emission microscopes; TEM-Talos (F 200X) and TEM-TitanTM (80-300). 
The TEM-Talos was operated at an accelerating voltage of 80–200 kV using a LaB6 source, an 
image resolution lower than 0.16 nm, a magnification of 25–1500000×. A Cu grid was used to 
spot the samples for the TEM analysis. The TEM- Titan was operated at an accelerating voltage 
of 80–300 kV, an image resolution lower than 0.1 nm, an electro probe size smaller than 0.09 
nm, a magnification of 25–1250000×. The samples were dispersed in ethanol using 
ultrasonication for 30 min. The resulting solution was dropped and deposited on a copper grid. 
The samples on the copper grid after solvent evaporation were used for the analysis. 
The TEM, dark-field scanning TEM (STEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), HR-
STEM images, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the RhSn bimetallic 
nanoparticles were also analyzed for atomic level studies. 
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of all the calcined and reduced catalysts were 
obtained using an Ulvac-PHI spectrometer (PHI 5000 Versa Probe; minimum X-ray beam size 
≤10 µm, energy resolution: ≤0.50 eV, sensitivity: ≥1000000 CPS, scanning electron gun 
(AES/SEM) and UV light source) using non-monochromated Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). 
The pressure in the analysis chamber was <1×10-7 Pa. Deconvolution of the Rh and Sn peaks 
was performed using a sum of Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. The binding energies were 
corrected using the C1s peak from carbon contamination at 284.6 eV. The amount of coke in 
the spent catalyst was measured using CHNS elemental analysis (on a Fision EA1108 
instrument). 
Coke formation can be analyzed qualitatively using Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FT-IR). The instrument used was an iS-10 spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher 
Scientific) with an attenuated total reflectance accessory, using a sensitivity (S/N ratio) of 
35000:1 (peak to peak), a resolution of 0.5 cm-1 and a range of 6500-500 cm-1.
A Raman analysis (Renishaw invia raman spectroscopy) was performed to determine 
the types of coke on the spent samples: Laser source: Ar laser-244 nm (UV), Nd:Yag laser- 
532 nm (Vis), diode laser-785 nm (Vis), 1064 nm (Near-IR), optical lens: ×50; grating: 830  
l/mm (1064), and scan range: 100-4000 cm-1.
The spent catalysts were also analyzed using the derivative thermogravimetric method 
(DTG) to determine the dependence of coke formation on the temperature. A Q600 (TA 
Instrument, US) instrument was used with the following settings: DTA sensitivity: 0.001 °C 
and calorimetric accuracy/precision: ±2%. The temperature range was 25 °C to 800 °C under 
an air atmosphere and the temperature ramping was 10 °C min-1. The coke weight loss can be 
studied using the DTG method.
The oxide samples were dried overnight at 110 °C before TPR and XPS analysis. To 
prepare reduced samples for TEM and XPS analysis, the calcined RhSn samples were first pre-
reduced in H2 (purity: 99.99%, 20 mL min-1) at 600 °C for 2 h before the TEM measurements 
of the reduced samples. The ramping rate for the reduction temperature was 20 °C min-1. 
After the reduction, the samples were cooled to room temperature in H2 and purged in Ar at 
room temperature for 4 h. The Rh and Sn contents in the prepared catalysts were determined 
by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP 6000 series, 
Thermo, USA).
2.3. Activity measurements
PDH was carried out in a tubular quartz reactor. The internal diameter of the tubular 
quartz reactor was 10 mm. Typically the reaction was conducted at 600 ºC and atmospheric 
pressure using 0.10 g of the prepared catalyst (100-140 mesh). The catalysts were pre-reduced 
in H2 (purity: 99.99 %, 20 ºC mL min-1) at 600 ºC for 2 h before the reaction. The ramping rate 
up to 600 ºC was 20 ºC mL min-1. A feed gas mixture (molar ratio of H2:N2:n-C3H8 = 
1.0:1.0:1.0) was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 30 mL min-1 (WHSV= 10.8 
h-1). The compositions of the products were analyzed by online gas chromatography using a 
capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technologies, i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m). The 
conversion of propane was calculated based on the carbon numbers in the products.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1.
 Physical Properties of the prepared catalysts: XRD and N2 sorption analysis
The prepared RhSn catalysts did not show distinctive metal phases in the XRD patterns 
(Fig. S2), indicating that the metals were well dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 supports. Characteristic 
peaks were observed at 39.3° (222), 37.5° (311), 45.6° (400) and 66.6° (440), which can be 
attributed to γ-Al2O3 (ICDD 29-0063). 
The pore size distributions of the prepared catalysts (Fig. S4) were obtained from the 
desorption branch of the adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S3) by the Barrett–Joyner–
Halenda (BJH) method. The pore size distributions of the calcined and reduced RhSn catalysts 
were not significantly different from that of the γ-Al2O3 support (Fig. S5). The distinctive 
mesopores were observed in the prepared catalysts. Table 1 shows a summary of the surface 
areas and total pore volumes of the prepared samples. All the samples have a similar pore 
diameter of ca. 5 nm in the inter-particles, a total pore volume of 0.84-0.92 at p/po=0.98 and a 
surface area of 230-265 m2 gcat-1. The surface area of the Rh(0.5) was not significantly affected 
by Sn addition for all the catalysts, indicating that Sn promoters are very well dispersed on the 
support. The reduced catalysts have similar surface areas (232-239 m2g-1), pore volumes (1.17-
0.87 cm3 g-1) and pore size distributions (ca. 5.0 nm) to the calcined catalysts.
3.2.
 CO chemisorption analysis
Table 2 shows the metal content, CO adsorbed, metal dispersion, specific metal surface 
area and average particle size of the prepared pristine catalysts. The loaded metal content was 
measured using ICP-OES. The measured amount of metal in the calcined catalysts was similar 
to that of the loaded precursors, indicating that the metal loss was very low during the catalyst 
preparation. The metal dispersion, specific metal surface area, and the average particle size of 
the Rh metals were measured by CO chemisorption method. The metal dispersion of the 
Rh(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), 
Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 60.9%, 49.4%, 50.8%, 
51.6%, 55.7%, 57.3%, 61.3%, 60.0% and 61.0%, respectively. When a small amount of Sn was 
added to Rh(0.5), the Rh metal dispersion decreased from 60.9% for Rh(0.5) to 49.4% for 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15). In contrast, the further addition of Sn increased the Rh metal dispersion, 
which finally reached 61.0% for Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst. Accordingly, the metal particle size 
of the RhSn catalysts was in the range of 1.8-2.2 nm. Here, the metal dispersion of these RhSn 
catalysts was comparable to or a little higher than that of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared for 
PDH [51-53]. 
3.3.
 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) Analysis
In the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) curves of all the prepared oxide 
samples up to 650 °C (Fig. S6), all the curves were de-convoluted into 5 peaks. The 
summarized data for the H2 consumption are listed in Table 3. The reduction of the Rh(0.5) 
oxide sample started at 120 °C and the reduction of the Rh(0.5) oxide sample finished at 580 
°C. Four peaks are observed at 182 °C, 269 °C, 407 °C, and 498 °C. The total amount of H2 
consumption was 0.077 mmol gcat-1, indicating that the Rh was mostly in the Rh2O3 phase 
(Rh2O3 estimated from the H2 consumption using elementary analysis: 0.0746 mmol gcat-1). 
The isolated reduction of Rh2O3 has been observed at 110-130 °C [54]. The reduction 
temperature of Rh2O3/γ-Al2O3 increased with a decrease in the Rh loading [55] and with an 
increase in the calcination temperature. Rh oxides calcined at a temperature higher than 600 
°C interact with γ-Al2O3, diffusing into the subsurface region and the bulk of γ-Al2O3. Then, 
the reduction temperature of Rh2O3 on γ-Al2O3 can be increased to 600 °C. As a result, the 
reduction of Rh oxides at 182 °C and 269 °C can be attributed to the reduction of the dispersed 
phase and the reduction at 407 °C and 498 °C can be attributed to the Rh phase interacting with 
the γ-Al2O3 in subsurface layers.

When Sn was added to the Rh(0.5) samples, the TPR patterns became so complex that 
it was difficult to analyze the origins of the reduction peaks. However, the reduction 
temperature of the Rh oxides at the α, β, γ, and θ peaks shifted to lower temperatures when Sn 
was added to Rh(0.5). Sn addition may weaken the interaction between Rh and alumina due to 
the competitive interaction of Rh and Sn with the alumina support. Generally, the loaded Sn 
oxides are not fully reduced even in the presence of Rh until the H2 reduction at 700 °C, which 
has also been attributed to the strong interaction between SnOx and alumina [56].
The reduction at γ and θ can be attributed to the co-reduction of Rh and Sn oxides. The 
reduction peak at δ can be assigned mainly to the reduction of Sn oxides. The reduction of Sn 
oxides can be promoted by hydrogen spillover in the presence of Rh [57].

 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis of the oxide and the reduced 
RhSn catalysts
Table 4 summarizes the binding energy of Sn from the deconvolution of the XPS 
spectra (Fig. S7). The XPS data of the calcined catalysts show that the Sn oxides in all the 
RhSn samples are in the mixed-phase of SnO2 and SnO after calcining at 600 °C for 3 h. The 
atomic percentages of SnO2 (%) in the total Sn were 59% for Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 64% for 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), 68% for Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), 73% for Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and 89% for Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). 
The atomic percentage of SnO2 in the total Sn of the RhSn oxide samples increased with an 
increase in the Sn content on Rh(0.5). After the reduction of the RhSn catalysts at 600 °C for 
2 h, the atomic amount of metallic Sn in the total Sn was 17% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst, 
19% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0) catalyst, 28% for the Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5) catalyst, 20% for the 
Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) catalyst, and 24% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst.

Fig. 1 shows the XPS spectra of Rh3d and Table 5 summarizes the binding energies and 
the valence states of Rh after the reduction of the catalysts at 600 oC for 2 h in H2. Rh3+ was 
observed 10 atomic % on Rh(0.5), 7 atomic% on Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) and 5 atomic % on 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) after the reduction. The metallic Rh (100%) only was observed on 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). The reduced Rh on the surface may be re-oxidized during the sample 
preparation for XPS analysis and RhSn alloy with high content may suppress the re-oxidation. 
On the other hand, RhSn alloy may assist the reduction of Rh oxide from TPR analysis. The 
TPR analysis shows the probability of the complete reduction of Rh oxide at 600 oC for 2 h. 
However, it should be noted that the binding energy of Rh(3d) is shifted to the lower value 
with increasing Sn content. The result indicates the intermetallic electron transfer from Sn to 
Rh in the RhSn alloy or bimetal. When we performed the reaction on both reduced Rh(0.5) and 
oxidized Rh(0.5), the cracking fraction on the oxidized Rh(0.5) was a little higher than that on 
the reduced Rh(0.5), but the activity on both catalysts is not so much different (Table S2).

Table 6 shows the percentage of Sn reduction calculated from the elemental analysis 
(Table 2), H2 consumption (Table 3) and XPS analysis (Table 4) assuming that the Rh oxides 
are completely reduced. The molar H2 consumption ratio to Rh with Rh(0.5) was 1.65, 
indicating that Rh2O3 was the main oxide phase of the calcined Rh(0.5). Table 6 shows that the 
reduction percentage of the Sn oxide on the surface (from XPS analysis) is a little higher than 
that in the bulk (from TPR analysis).

Once the Sn oxide is reduced to Sn metal, Sn migrates into the Rh, resulting in a highly 
reductive RhSn alloy at 600 °C. Assuming that all the reduced Sn metal on the surface is present 
in the RhSn alloy or RhSn bimetals, the average RhSn composition on the surface of catalysts 
from XPS is estimated to be Rh1.0Sn0.25 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst, Rh1.0Sn0.35 for 
the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0) catalyst, Rh1.0Sn0.79 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) catalyst, 
Rh1.0Sn0.82 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) catalyst and Rh1.0Sn1.43 for the reduced 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst. Because the presence of isolated Sn cannot be completely excluded, it 
is expected that the real Sn content in the RhSn alloy will be a little lower than the above 
estimated average alloy composition.

 Morphology and RhSn alloy formation of the catalysts from TEM, STEM and 
EDS mapping analyses
Fig. 2 shows the particle size distribution of the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts from STEM images by a Talos TEM microscope. 
The average particle size of the reduced catalysts was calculated with more than 100 metallic 
particles using Image J (1.46r, National Institute of Health, USA). The metallic particle sizes 
of the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts are 1.4, 1.5 and 
1.9 nm from the TEM analysis with reduced catalysts, respectively. The particle size of the 
reduced catalysts from the TEM analysis is comparatively matching with the data obtained 
from the CO chemisorption. 
Fig. 2. Particle size distribution using STEM images of reduced, Spent (5h) and spent (20h) catalysts: 
(a1-a3): Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), (b1-b3) Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and (c1-c3) Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts respectively
HR-STEM images from a Titan TEM microscope (Fig. S8) show that the particles of 
1.4~1.9 nm are composed of randomly distributed atomic level particles (~0.1 nm), indicating 
that the particles from the STEM images (Talos TEM microscope) are not single alloy phases 
but the aggregates of a few atomic particles. However, when we examined the fringes of Talos 
TEM microscope of scattered large particles of 6-10 nm, it is confirmed that the ratio of Sn to 
Rh on the RhSn alloy increases with an increase in the Sn to Rh ratio on the RhSn catalysts 
(Fig. S9).  When we analyze the composition of Rh and Sn with the Talos TEM-EDX analysis 
(Fig. S10), it is shown that the composition of Rh and Sn is close to the composition of ICP-
OES analysis (Table S3), indicating that the composition of Rh and Sn in small area is similar 
to that of the bulk Rh Sn composition.  The TEM-EDX mapping (Fig. S11) shows that the Rh 
particles on the support are mostly positioned near the Sn particles. Therefore, the extensive 
TEM analysis shows that the nanoparticles (1.4~1.9 nm) are the aggregates of a few atomic 
particles. The extensive TEM analysis shows that the particles of 1.4~1.9 nm from Talos-TEM 
are composed of a few atomic levels of Rh, Sn and RhSn bimetallic alloy.
Therefore, it is more reliable that the calculated metallic ratio of Sn to Rh from the 
reduction percentage of Sn oxides (TPR and XPS analysis) is close to the metallic ratio of Sn 
to Rh on the particles of 1.4~1.9 nm. Thus, it is inferred that the Sn content in the RhSn alloy 
or bimetals increases with the addition of Sn on the average composition (Table 6).

 Propane dehydrogenation on the prepared catalysts 
Fig. 3 shows the propane (C3) conversion and propylene (C3=) selectivity at 600 °C and a 
WHSV of 10.8 h-1. The catalytic performances are summarized in Table 7. The initial C3 
conversion of the Pt(0.5) and Rh(0.5) catalysts were 18.1% and 10.7%, respectively. After 5 h 
of reaction, Rh(0.5) exhibited a final yield of 1.8%, while Pt(0.5) showed 11.8%, indicating 
that the dehydrogenation on Rh(0.5) was insignificant for PDH (Table 7).

The Pt(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for dehydrogenation (C3= selectivity: 83.1%), 
while the Rh(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for cracking (C1-C2 selectivity: 73.5%) (Table 
S2). Table S4 shows the normalized product distribution of the cracking products using the 
Rh(0.5) and Pt(0.5) catalysts, respectively. The amount of methane in the cracking products on 
Rh(0.5) was much higher than on Pt(0.5). Recent DFT calculation on Pt and PtSn in propane 
dehydrogenation agrees that the cracking barrier to methane is higher than that to propylene so 
that methane is produced from methylidyne and ethylidyne via propyne (intermediates of deep 
dehydrogenation [20,39-41].

10.8 h-1). ()-Pt(0.5), ()-Rh(0.5), ()-Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
()- Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) and ()- 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0).
If methane is a primary product of propane, the conversion of Rh(0.5) (conversion: 10.7 
%) should not be so low as compared with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) (conversion: 25.6%), because Sn 
addition should suppress both propane cracking and dehydrogenation activity. Therefore, it can 
be deduced that the deep dehydrogenation on Rh(0.5) is very severe, because the desorption 
barrier for intermediates during dehydrogenation is very high compared to Pt(0.5). 
Furthermore, C2 products are not produced and methane is mainly produced on Rh(0.5) (Table 
S5). The low C3 conversion of Rh(0.5) is ascribed to the fast coke formation to cover the surface 
of Rh(0.5). Methane on Rh(0.5) can be mainly produced through the cracking of strongly 
adsorbed intermediates (Table S5), similarly to Pt [41]. On the other hand, C2 species is rarely 
observed. In short-term PDH reaction (every 30 sec until 6 min) (Fig. S12(b)), the conversion 
of Rh(0.5) at 30 sec is 22.8% and the deactivation is very fast. Methane is mainly produced on 
Rh(0.5). On the other hand, it should be noted that ethane and ethylene is co-produced with 
methane on Pt(0.5) in Table S4(a). Therefore, the short-term experiments support that methane 
on Rh(0.5) can be produced from the cracking of the strongly adsorbed intermediate of deep 
dehydrogenation. In C3H8-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption, Fig. S13), most of 
adsorbed propane (m/z:29) is desorbed at the temperature lower than 300 oC, while propylene 
(m/z:41) is completely desorbed at 390 oC with Rh(0.5), 485 oC with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) and  560 
oC with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). H2 desorption at high temperature is ascribed to onset of 
dehydrogenation, indicating that the coke formation through further dehydrogenation on 
Rh(0.5) occurs at much lower temperature than that on the Sn added Rh(0.5) catalysts. Methane 
(m/z:16) desorption is maximized at the temperature which desorption of propane and 
propylene stops, indicating that methane is mostly generated through deep dehydrogenation. 
No C2 fragment at high temperature in C3H8-TPD (Fig. S13) supports that methane is mainly 
produced through the deep dehydrogenation. The intensity of methane (m/z:16) is very high 
with Rh(0.5), as compared with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0).  So, it can be concluded 
that the Sn addition retarded the deep dehydrogenation and suppressed the cracking of strongly 
adsorbed intermediate during dehydrogenation.  
PDH occurs in two stages: (1) quick deactivation within the first tens of minutes by a fast 
coke formation and (2) a stable steady state after the first stage [58].
When a small amount of Sn (0.15 wt%) was added to Rh(0.5), the C3 conversion and the 
C3= selectivity was dramatically enhanced. The initial C3 conversion and C3= selectivity with 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) were 25.6% and 79.9%, respectively. The C3 conversion increased with 
increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts. The initial conversion of the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 25.6%, 26.4%, 27.8%, 31.1%, 31.7%, 
31.5%, 29.5% and 30.8%, respectively. The C3 conversion for the RhSn catalysts with more 
than 1.0 wt% of Sn is similar. On the other hand, the C3= selectivity and stability of all the 
RhSn catalysts also clearly increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Finally, the C3= yield of 
the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst after 5 h of reaction (26.8%) was the highest among the prepared 
catalysts. 
Sn has been used as a good promoter for increasing the olefin selectivity of Pt catalysts in 
light alkane dehydrogenation [27,32,24,44]. The geometric and electronic effects resulting in 
the effects of Sn on Pt in light alkane dehydrogenation have been discussed [24, 31-37]. The 
effect of Sn on Rh can also be explained in the same way, although the Sn effect on Rh in PDH 
was much more pronounced than that on Pt (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1). Nonetheless, the significant 
improvement in dehydrogenation on RhSn is unusual compared to PtSn, when a small amount 
of Sn is added to Rh(0.5).
The PtSn catalytic system has so far been considered to be the best catalyst for PDH in terms 
of conversion and selectivity [13,55,57,59-62]. The amount of Sn in the PtSn catalysts has been 
optimized at a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.0-1.5 for PDH (Fig. S1) [44,59]. Fig. 4, Fig. S1, Table 
S1, Fig. S14, and Table S6 show a brief and comparative study (initial conversion and 
selectivity) to clarify the effect of different amounts of Sn on the RhSn and PtSn catalysts at 
the range between 500-600 °C. The initial C3 conversion with the PtSn catalysts increased up 
to a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.5 and then decreased with the further addition of Sn [32]. The 
excess Sn suppressed the C3 conversion of the PtSn catalysts. From these observations, it has 
been claimed that Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1 is an active phase for PDH [43,44,59]. The reported DFT 
calculations [39] have shown that the activation energy for PDH on Pt increases with increasing 
amounts of Sn, while the adsorption energy of 1-propyl on Pt decreases. Thus, a PtSn alloy 
with an intermediate PtSn composition, Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1, has been claimed to be the optimum 
phase for PDH, with decreased activity and increased selectivity due to Sn addition.

WHSV rate of 10.8 h-1.
In contrast, no optimized Sn/Rh ratio was observed with Sn/Rh weight ratios up to 6.0. The 
average Sn/Rh atomic ratio from elemental analysis and XPS increased with increasing 
amounts of Sn. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of Sn enhanced the yield of 
propylene by suppressing the cracking via deep dehydrogenation without an optimized RhSn 
composition. On the other hand, the RhSn catalysts with more than 1.0 wt% Sn exhibited a 
similar C3 conversion and metal dispersion. It is clear that the C3= selectivity increased with 
increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts.
 
To clarify the Sn effect on the intrinsic catalytic activity, the catalytic activity was examined 
with respect to W/F (Fig. S15). W/F values of 63.1 (s), 126.2 (s) and 252.4 (s) are equivalent 
to WHSV value of 43.3, 21.7, and 10.8 h-1 respectively. It is clear from the data at 43.3 h-1 that 
the C3 conversion of the RhSn catalysts, as well as the C3= selectivity, increases with increasing 
Sn content. At low WHSV of 10.8 h-1, the similar conversion for RhSn catalysts with more 
than 0.75 wt% Sn content is shown. Accordingly, there was no considerable difference in 
turnover frequency (TOF) at the WHSV of 10.8 h-1. Whereas, the TOF values at the higher 
WHSV of 43.3 h-1 increased with an increase in Sn content. The TOF of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 2.03 s-1, 2.09 s-1 and 2.65 s-1 at the WHSV 
of 43.3 h-1, respectively (Fig. S16). TOF increased with an increase in Sn content on RhSn 
catalysts.

 Long-term stability of the RhSn catalysts
Fig. 5 shows the longer term stability tests over 20 h for Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) at 600 °C and a WHSV of 10.8 h-1. The catalytic performances are summarized 
in Table 8. The deactivation parameters for the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 58.3%, 36.0%, and 27.2%, respectively. The longer term 
stability clarified the higher stability, as well as C3= selectivity, of the RhSn catalysts with 
higher Sn contents.

Table 9 shows the metal dispersion and metal particle size of the spent Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 
Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts after 5 h and 20 h. The metal dispersions and metal 
sizes were obtained by CO chemisorption and TEM analysis (Fig. 2) using the spent catalyst 
after 5 h and 20 h of reaction. 
Fig. 5. Long-term stability test with ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and ()- Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) 
catalysts for 20 h (WHSV of 10.8 h-1).
CO chemisorption of the spent Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) 
catalysts after 5 h and 20 h was performed after two different pre-treatments: (1) CO 
chemisorption after H2 re-reduction at 600 °C for 2 h following coke removal by oxidation at 
600 °C for 1 h, and (2) CO chemisorption after H2 re-reduction at 600 °C for 2 h. The Rh 
dispersion without coke removal (DCOH2) is much smaller than DCOO2, indicating that the 
exposed metal is significantly covered by coke during the reaction. The ratio of DCOH2/DCOO2 
was the highest with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), indicating that coke formation was significantly 
suppressed due to Sn addition to Rh(0.5), supporting that the low C3 conversion with Rh(0.5) 
is due to the fast coke formation to cover the metal surface of Rh(0.5).
The Rh particle size of the spent catalysts determined by the CO chemisorption after 
coke removal (NCOO2) was a little smaller than that measured by TEM (NSTEM). However, the 
particle sizes determined from the TEM analysis indicate that the metal continued to be sintered 
during the reaction. On the other hand, the metal sintering of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) is very severe 
compared to Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). It is clear that both the coke formation and 
metal sintering of RhSn with a high Sn content are strongly suppressed, which may be one of 
the reasons for the higher stability of RhSn with a higher Sn content. 
From Table 9, the low C3 conversion with Rh(0.5) can be ascribed to the fast coke 
formation via the deep dehydrogenation in the initial stage. The Sn addition suppressed the 
coke formation increasing the C3 conversion. Generally, it has been known that coke forms on 
metal in alkane dehydrogenation, which migrates to the support [63]. TEM analysis shows that 
the severe coke on both metal and support of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst was observed and metal 
is almost covered by coke, and the Sn addition suppressed the coke formation on both Rh and 
support (Fig. S17). Again, the low C3 conversion can be due to the fast and severe coke 
formation to cover the metal and the low C3= selectivity can be due to the high barrier of 
propylene desorption inducing the deep dehydrogenation. On Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), coke is observed 
mainly on the support indicating that coke on metal can be spilt to the support.  
The TG-DTA and molecular spectroscopy have been used to monitor the coke 
formation on metallic catalysts. TG-DTA (thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis) 
experiments were carried out to examine the formation of cokes during the reaction time. Fig. 
6 shows the DTG curves of the spent (after 5 h) catalysts from the TGA curves (Fig. S18 (a-
d)) and Table 10 summarizes the amount of coke determined from the TGA and CHN analyses. 
The amount of coke determined from TGA was greater than that from the CHN analysis. The 
amount of coke determined by CHN may be more accurate because the weight loss from TGA 
can include errors from the buoyancy force and impurities such as water due to surface 
hydroxyls. Two typical DTG curves for cokes were observed for PDH. Peak I at low 
temperature can be assigned to coke on the metal and peak II can be assigned to coke on the 
support [64-66]. If coke forms on the intrinsic acid sites of the supports, the amount of coke 
should not be related to the amount of active metal. However, the amount of coke on the support 
decreased with an increase in the amount of Sn. As a result, it has been thought that the coke 
on the metal migrated to the support during the PDH reaction. Several authors have suggested 
that Sn in PtSn facilitates the migration of coke from the metal to the support [63,67,68].

However, Fig. 6 and Table 10 indicate that Sn does not play a decisive role in the coke 
migration. Rather, the coke percentage on the support (peak II) was the highest with Rh(0.5) 
and the amount of coke on the support decreased with increasing amounts of Sn. Therefore, it 
is clear that a simple drain-off effect dominates the coke migration. When the coke accumulates 
on the metal, the coke migration can be promoted irrespective of the active metal. A DFT 
calculation with PtSn has indicated that the propylene at the Pt-Sn bridge site can be relaxed to 
form a Pt-Pt bridge [39]. Similarly, the propylene at the Rh-Sn sites can migrate to Rh rich 
sites, where coke can form via deep dehydrogenation. Thus, the amount of coke on RhSn 
decreased with increasing amounts of Sn because coke formation via deep dehydrogenation is 
favored at Rh rich sites. Therefore, coke migration may be more limited in RhSn catalysts with 
higher amounts of Sn.
Fig. 7 shows the convoluted (A) and de-convoluted (B) Raman spectra of the spent (after 
5h) catalysts: [(a1)- (d1)] and [(a2)- (d2)] of Rh(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), and 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts respectively. Five major peaks at 1335, 1597, 2683, 2917, and 3150 
cm-1 are observed for the spent Rh(0.5) catalysts. The bands from 2656 cm-1 to 2926 cm-1 
(methylene type) can be assigned to aliphatic hydrocarbons. The bands from 3150 cm-1 to 3183 
cm-1 can be assigned to aromatic carbons [69]. The area ratio of the aromatic C-H to aliphatic 
C-H (Table 11(a)) decreases with increasing amounts of Sn, indicating that the presence of Sn 
suppresses the formation of aromatic carbons.

The bands at 1330-1335 (D band) and 1581-1600 cm-1 (G band) can be assigned to 
graphite-like carbon species [70-75]. Here, we observed a band at the front shoulder of the D 
band (1235-1260 cm-1), which is designated a-D. The band at the front shoulder of the G band 
(1507-1542 cm-1) is designated a-G. The bands at a-D and a-G were assigned to the turbostratic 
or random structure [73,76,77].

The G mode is the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites [26,78]. Thus, the G band 
can be seen even without the long-range order of the graphite structure, if any pair of sp2 sites 
are present. Therefore, the a-D and a-G bands are prominent features of the D and G bands of 
tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and its hydrogenated analog (ta-C:H) with a higher sp3 
content. 
The D band cannot be seen in perfect graphite with a long-range graphite structure. 
Therefore, the IDI/IG ratio has been used to identify graphitization. The position of the G band 
in the Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. 7 (~1600 cm-1), is much higher than the position of the 
G band in perfect graphite (~1580 cm-1). The higher energy of the G band can be attributed to 
nanocrystalline graphite or completely disordered sp2-bonded carbon (a-C). In that case, the D 
band indicates ordering, exactly the opposite of the case of long-range ordered graphite [78]. 
Therefore, the increase in IDI/IG means an increase in the number of aromatic rings. 
Here, IDI/IG decreases with increasing amounts of Sn, as shown in Table 11(b), which means 
that the amounts of aromatic carbon decrease with increasing amounts of Sn. Fig. 8 shows the 
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of all the spent Rh and RhSn catalysts after 5 h and 
20 h of reaction. The absorption bands between 1400-1450 cm-1 can be ascribed to the skeleton 
vibrations of branched aliphatics [79].
Fig. 8. FT-IR spectra of the spent catalysts after PDH for 5 h: (a) Rh(0.5), (b) Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), (c) 
Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), (d) Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) and FT-IR spectra of the spent catalysts after PDH for 20 h: (b’) 
Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), (c’) Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and (d’) Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0).
The bands between 1640-1680 cm-1 represent the C=C stretching vibrations of alkenes 
[80] and the bands between 1500-1630 cm-1 can be assigned to the C=C vibrations of aromatics 
[81]. The spent Rh(0.5) catalyst shows both aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic species. The 
intensity of the aromatic bands decreases gradually with increasing amounts of Sn on Rh, while 
the branched aliphatic bands slightly increase. However, the stretching vibrations of the 
unsaturated aliphatic carbon remain in all the spent catalysts. It should be noted that no aromatic 
carbon bands are observed on the RhSn catalysts with Sn content of more than 1.0 wt%, which 
implies that the formation of aromatic intermediates is suppressed on the RhSn alloy, 
improving the stability of the catalysts in the first stage. However, the accumulation of aromatic 
intermediates on the RhSn catalysts was observed a little after 20 h, indicating that coke 
formation can also affect the long-term stability. Nonetheless, the aromatic intermediates on 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) were almost negligible even after 20 h.
As explained earlier, the Rh(0.5) catalyst showed a very low C3 conversion and C3= 
selectivity. The low C3= selectivity with Rh(0.5) can be attributed to the high barrier for 
propylene desorption. Accordingly, cracking via deep dehydrogenation (methane formation) 
predominantly occurred on Rh(0.5). A very low C3 conversion may be due to the blocking of 
the Rh metal sites by fast coke formation in the initial stage. The short-term experiments (Fig. 
S12) and C3H8-TPD experiments (Fig. S13) support the explanations. A small amount of 
added Sn (0.15 wt%) drastically improved both the C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity. The 
C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity were improved by adding Sn to Rh(0.5) up to 3 wt%. 
Table 9 and Table 10 indicates that both Rh sintering and coke formation were significantly 
suppressed by the addition of Sn, resulting in high activity and stability. This apparent behavior 
of RhSn is quite different from that of PtSn. On PtSn, the addition of Sn increases the activation 
energy for PDH, thereby reducing the C3 conversion, while it decreased the desorption barrier, 
resulting in high selectivity. Thus, it has been suggested that Pt3Sn or Pt2Sn are the active 
species for PDH. However, the role of Sn addition should be the same for both PtSn and RhSn. 
In the case of Rh, coke formation on Rh is much worse compared to Pt. Therefore, Sn addition 
suppresses severe coke formation to maintain the activity of Rh, which overcomes the loss of 
the intrinsic activity of PDH. Therefore, the C3 conversion is increased by Sn addition. Even 
with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), coke is generated to such an extent that the main role of Sn is to enhance 
the C3 conversion. However, the desorption barrier of propylene may also be decreased by Sn 
addition, similar to PtSn.   
4. Conclusions
Rh(0.5)Sn(x.x)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of Sn were prepared and 
examined for PDH. Rh (0.5 wt%) was loaded onto γ-Al2O3 support (Rh(0.5)), and a Sn amount 
of 0.15-3.0 wt% was added to the Rh(0.5). The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion 
and very low C3= selectivity compared to the Pt(0.5) catalyst. The Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) catalyst with 
a low amount of Sn drastically improved both the C3 conversion and C3= selectivity. The C3 
conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing 
amounts of Sn. Rh(0.5) showed methane selectivity of ~84% with negligible C2 species at the 
similar conversion to Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) at the initial activity test at 30 sec. On the other hand, 
Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) showed high propylene selectivity of 96% even at the initial activity at 30 sec.  
C3H8-TPD curves exhibit that methane (m/z:16) desorption is maximized at the temperature 
which desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mainly generated 
by the cracking of intermediates through deep dehydrogenation. Corresponding to the reaction, 
the intensity of desorbed methane is very high on Rh(0.5) and the deep dehydrogenation is 
pronounced as compared with Sn added Rh catalysts. 
Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is 
the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH.

Graphical abstract
Highlights
C3= selectivity on Rh(0.5) is less than 26% in PDH and methane is a major product.
Low C3= selectivity on Rh(0.5) is ascribed to the severe deep dehydrogenation.
Sn addition to Rh(0.5) enhances both conversion and C3= selectivity nonotonously. 
Sn addition to Rh results in RhSn alloy lowering barrier for propylene desorption.
RhSn alloy suppresses the sintering of Rh resulting in high stability.
