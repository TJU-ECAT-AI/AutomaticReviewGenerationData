1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include developing catalysts with larger particle sizes and optimizing reaction conditions to reduce the formation of coke precursors.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，有可能弥补传统裂解器留下的丙烯供应短缺。然而，该过程与主要问题相关，如长链烃的裂解和焦炭形成。裂解降低了所需产品的选择性，而焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。失活的催化剂必须经常再生，而不会失去活性，选择性和稳定性，这增加了过程复杂性和操作成本。已经致力于开发脱氢催化剂的研究，以增加DHP反应的速率，同时减少诸如裂解等不需要的副反应，从而延长催化剂的寿命。较小的颗粒(3 nm)比较大的颗粒(21 nm)更活跃，但选择性较低，前者的焦化速率，焦炭形成的选择性和形成的焦炭量明显高于后者。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括开发具有较大颗粒尺寸的催化剂和优化反应条件以减少焦炭前体的形成。
