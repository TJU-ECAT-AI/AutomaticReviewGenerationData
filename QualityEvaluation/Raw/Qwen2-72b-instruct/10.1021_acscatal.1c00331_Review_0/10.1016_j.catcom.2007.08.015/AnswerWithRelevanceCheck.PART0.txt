          [1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers [13]."
          [2] "However,major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."
          [3] "The former reduces the desired product selectivity and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The deacti- vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los- ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."
          [5] "Consequently,much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena- tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time."
          [6] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm)."
          [7] "Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig- nificantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [8] "The most sig- nificant effect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma- tion during the reaction."
          [9] "Accordingly, coke content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a)."
          [10] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv- ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."
          [11] "However, from the above observations, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro- genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."
          [12] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11],namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti- cles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11],namely dehydrogenation reactions."
          [13] "Consequently, selectiv- ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation."
          [14] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."
          [15] "By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually (Fig. 2a and b)."
          [16] "Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the effect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be excluded."
          [17] "The other plausible reasons for the decrease in the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini- tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modifications in the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream [12]."

          The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially make up for the shortfall in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the desired product selectivity, while coke formation causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deactivated catalyst must be frequently regenerated without losing activity, selectivity, and stability, which increases the process complexity and operation costs. Research has been devoted to developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus prolonging the life time of the catalyst. Smaller particles (3 nm) are much more active and less selective than larger particles (21 nm), and the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter. The size of Pt particles on the catalyst can significantly affect the rate of coke formation, with smaller particles leading to higher coke content. Using a TEOM/GC system can provide comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking from a single catalysis experiment. The reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2, and even to surface carbon deposits. Small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, leading to cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, leading to dehydrogenation reactions. Selectivity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between CH and CC bond activation. Coke can act as a promoter to improve selectivity by deactivating sites that are active for CC bond activation. The decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity and increase in initial selectivity to CH4 and C2 on large Pt particles could be due to rearrangement or modifications in the behavior of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on stream.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，有可能弥补传统裂解器留下的丙烯供应缺口。然而，该过程与主要问题相关，如长链烃的裂解和焦炭形成。裂解降低了所需产品的选择性，而焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。失活的催化剂必须经常再生，而不会失去活性，选择性和稳定性，这增加了过程复杂性和操作成本。已经致力于开发脱氢催化剂的研究，以增加DHP反应的速率，同时减少诸如裂解等不需要的副反应，从而延长催化剂的寿命。较小的颗粒(3 nm)比较大的颗粒(21 nm)更活跃但选择性较差，前者的焦化速率，焦炭形成的选择性和形成的焦炭量明显高于后者。催化剂上Pt粒子的大小可以显著影响焦炭形成的速率，较小的粒子会导致更高的焦炭含量。使用TEOM/GC系统可以从单一催化实验中提供关于活性、选择性和焦炭形成的全面信息。涉及共同表面中间体的反应机制可以作为C3H6脱附，或者进一步裂解为C1、C2，甚至表面碳沉积。小Pt粒子对CC键活化非常活跃，导致裂解反应，而相对较大的Pt粒子对CH键活化更具选择性，导致脱氢反应。C3H6的选择性取决于CH和CC键活化之间的活性比。焦炭可以作为促进剂，通过使CC键活化活性位点失活来提高选择性。在大Pt粒子上，初始C3H6选择性的降低和初始CH4和C2选择性的增加可能是由于Pt粒子中Pt位点的行为在流经时间上的重新排列或修改。

          PDH is a method for propene production that can help make up for the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers. The key considerations for PDH include the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation, which can reduce product selectivity and cause catalyst deactivation. Catalyst regeneration is necessary to maintain activity, selectivity, and stability, but this increases process complexity and operation costs. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts impacts the process efficiency by reducing the desired product selectivity and causing deactivation of the catalyst. The rate of coking is significantly higher on catalysts with smaller Pt particles, leading to a higher coke content. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include developing dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking. Small Pt particles are very active for cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

          PDH是丙烯生产的一种方法，可以帮助弥补传统裂解器留下的丙烯供应缺口。PDH的关键考虑因素包括长链烃的裂解和焦炭的形成，这会降低所需产品的选择性并导致催化剂失活。为了保持活性、选择性和稳定性，需要催化剂再生，但这会增加工艺复杂性和运营成本。在基于Pt的催化剂上，焦炭的形成通过降低所需产品的选择性和导致催化剂失活影响过程效率。在具有较小Pt颗粒的催化剂上，焦化速率显著较高，导致焦炭含量较高。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括开发增加DHP反应速率同时减少不需要的副反应（如裂解）的脱氢催化剂。小Pt颗粒在裂解反应中非常活跃，而相对较大的Pt颗粒在脱氢反应中更具选择性。
