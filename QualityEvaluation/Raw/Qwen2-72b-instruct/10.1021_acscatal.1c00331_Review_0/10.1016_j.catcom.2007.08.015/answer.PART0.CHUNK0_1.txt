1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a method for propene production that can potentially fill the gap in propylene supply left by conventional crackers. However, the process is associated with major problems such as the cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The cracking reduces the selectivity of the desired product, while coke formation causes catalyst deactivation. Smaller particle catalysts (3 nm) are more active but less selective than larger particle catalysts (21 nm). The rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher on smaller particle catalysts than on larger particle catalysts.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种方法，有可能填补传统裂解器留下的丙烯供应缺口。然而，该过程与主要问题相关，如长链烃的裂解和焦炭形成。裂解降低了所需产品的选择性，而焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。较小的颗粒催化剂(3 nm)比较大的颗粒催化剂(21 nm)更活跃但选择性较差。较小颗粒催化剂上的焦化速率、焦炭形成的选择性和形成的焦炭量明显高于较大颗粒催化剂。
