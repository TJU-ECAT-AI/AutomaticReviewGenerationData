[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
[5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
[6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
[7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
[9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
[10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
[11] "Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."
[12] "For example, the duration of the regeneration is the same as dehydrogenation in Catofin technology."
[13] "Another side effect of coke removal is that the catalyst could agglomerate and lose activity under harsh conditions during regeneration."
[14] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
[15] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[16] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
[17] "It is indicated that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions."
[18] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
[19] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
[20] "For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."
[21] "Therefore, the modification of nature of support is a useful way to improve coke resistance."
[22] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
[23] "The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature."
[24] "Some studies indicated that they are very coke resistance, but the opposites were also reported."
[25] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is a highly endothermic process (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol) that requires temperatures above 500°C, and it is one of the most promising methods for large-scale propylene production. The reaction can be catalyzed by either metal or metal oxide catalysts, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative examples. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company, and the regeneration of these catalysts involves the combustion of coke with a chlorine-air mixture. Platinum catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability in PDH, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly impair catalytic performance and stability. The complex reaction network of PDH can lead to the formation of coke, which covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to active sites. The removal of coke is not straightforward, and the regeneration process can lead to catalyst agglomeration and loss of activity under harsh conditions. To mitigate coke formation, strategies such as co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying platinum with other metals like tin, modifying the nature of the support to reduce side reactions, and controlling the size of the platinum catalyst can be effective. The role of small-sized platinum particles in coke resistance is not yet clear, and single-atom platinum catalysts have shown a different mechanism when reaching the size limit.

1.丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一个高度吸热的过程（ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol），需要超过500°C的温度，是大规模生产丙烯的最有希望的方法之一。该反应可以由金属或金属氧化物催化剂催化，其中铂和铬氧化物是最具代表性的例子。铂基催化剂被用于UOP公司的Oleflex商业PDH过程中，这些催化剂的再生涉及用氯气-空气混合物燃烧焦炭。铂催化剂因其在PDH中的高选择性和耐用性而受到青睐，但反应中的焦炭形成会严重影响催化性能和稳定性。PDH的复杂反应网络可能导致焦炭的形成，这会覆盖金属催化剂并阻止活性位点的接触。焦炭的去除并不简单，再生过程在恶劣条件下可能导致催化剂聚结和活性损失。为了减少焦炭的形成，可以采取一些策略，如与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将铂与锡等其他金属合金化，修改载体的性质以减少副反应，以及控制铂催化剂的尺寸。小尺寸铂颗粒在焦炭抗性中的作用尚不清楚，而单原子铂催化剂在达到尺寸极限时显示出不同的机制。
