          [1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
          [2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
          [3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
          [4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
          [5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
          [6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
          [7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
          [8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
          [9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
          [10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
          [11] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
          [12] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
          [13] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
          [14] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
          [15] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
          [16] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."
          [17] "The computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were very active in the exploration of PDH catalyst and provide important insight on the deactivation mechanism."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. Two main types of catalysts are used: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative. Platinum-based catalysts are used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves coke combustion with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The PDH reaction network is complex, with intermediates and propylene prone to further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke formation. Coke can cover the catalyst and block active sites. Strategies to reduce coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn, using transition metals like Cu and Zn, modifying support properties, and controlling Pt catalyst size. Computational simulations using density functional theory (DFT) have provided insights into the deactivation mechanism of PDH catalysts.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种在工业上大规模生产丙烯的高效方法。该反应是吸热的，需要超过500摄氏度的温度。主要使用两种类型的催化剂：金属和金属氧化物，其中铂和铬氧化物是最具代表性的。铂基催化剂用于UOP的Oleflex商业PDH工艺中，其中催化剂再生涉及用氯气-空气混合物燃烧焦炭。Pt基催化剂因其高选择性和耐用性而受到青睐，但反应中焦炭的形成会严重影响催化性能和稳定性。PDH反应网络是复杂的，中间体和丙烯在高温下容易发生进一步反应，导致焦炭的形成。焦炭可以覆盖催化剂并阻塞活性位点。减少焦炭形成的策略包括与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将Pt与Sn等金属合金化，使用Cu和Zn等过渡金属，修改支撑物性质，以及控制Pt催化剂的尺寸。基于密度泛函理论（DFT）的计算模拟为PDH催化剂的失活机制提供了见解。
