[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
[5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
[6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
[7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[8] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."
[9] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
[10] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
[11] "Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."
[12] "For example, the duration of the regeneration is the same as dehydrogenation in Catofin technology."
[13] "Another side effect of coke removal is that the catalyst could agglomerate and lose activity under harsh conditions during regeneration."
[14] "Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH."
[15] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[16] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
[17] "It is indicated that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions."
[18] "In addition to Sn, there are many reports of various transition metals, including Cu and Zn, which can be helpful to curb coke."
[19] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
[20] "For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."
[21] "Therefore, the modification of nature of support is a useful way to improve coke resistance."
[22] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
[23] "The role of small-sized (around 3 nm) Pt particles is not yet clear in the literature."
[24] "Some studies indicated that they are very coke resistance, but the opposites were also reported."
[25] "Interestingly, the single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."

1.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly endothermic process that occurs at temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius, making it an effective industrial route for large-scale production of propylene. The reaction involves the abstraction of two hydrogens from propane, resulting in propylene and hydrogen. Two main classes of catalysts are used in PDH: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative catalysts. Platinum-based catalysts are employed in the Oleflex commercial PDH process by UOP, where catalyst regeneration involves the combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability in PDH, but coke formation during the reaction significantly impacts catalytic performance and stability. The complex reaction network of PDH can lead to the formation of coke, which covers metal catalysts and blocks access to active sites. The removal of coke is not straightforward and can lead to catalyst agglomeration and loss of activity during regeneration. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with metals like Sn to constrain Pt in a small ensemble, and modifying the nature of the support to improve coke resistance. The size of the Pt catalyst also plays a significant role in reactivity and side reactions, with small-sized Pt particles showing varying degrees of coke resistance.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种高度吸热的过程，反应温度高于500摄氏度，使其成为大规模生产丙烯的有效工业途径。该反应涉及从丙烷中抽离两个氢原子，产生丙烯和氢气。PDH中使用的两大类催化剂是金属和金属氧化物，其中铂和铬氧化物是最具代表性的催化剂。铂基催化剂被UOP用于Oleflex商业PDH过程中，其中催化剂再生涉及用氯气-空气混合物燃烧焦炭。Pt基催化剂因其在PDH中的高选择性和耐用性而受到青睐，但反应过程中焦炭的形成严重影响了催化性能和稳定性。PDH的复杂反应网络可能导致焦炭的形成，这会覆盖金属催化剂并阻止活性位点的接触。焦炭的去除并非易事，可能会导致再生过程中催化剂的聚集和活性损失。减少焦炭形成的策略包括与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将Pt与Sn等金属合金化以将Pt限制在小集合体中，以及修改支撑物的性质以提高焦炭抵抗力。Pt催化剂的大小也对反应性和副反应有重大影响，小尺寸（约3纳米）的Pt颗粒显示出不同程度的焦炭抵抗力。
