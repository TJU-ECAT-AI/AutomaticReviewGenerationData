[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

1.The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a highly endothermic process (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol) that occurs at temperatures above 500°C, making it an effective industrial route for producing propylene. The reaction can be categorized based on the type of catalyst used, with metal and metal oxide catalysts being the two main classes. Platinum and chromium oxide are the most representative catalysts in these categories. Platinum-based catalysts, in particular, are employed in the Oleflex commercial PDH process by UOP, where the regeneration of the catalyst involves the combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability in PDH, but coke formation during the reaction can severely impact their performance and stability. The formation of coke is a result of deep reactions at elevated temperatures involving intermediates and propylene, leading to the coverage of metal catalysts and blocking of active sites. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with other metals such as Sn, modifying the nature of the support, and controlling the size of the Pt catalyst. The use of single Pt atom catalysts has also been explored, revealing a different mechanism at the size limit.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种高度吸热过程（ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol），在500°C以上的温度下进行，使其成为工业生产丙烯的有效途径。反应可以根据所用催化剂的类型进行分类，金属和金属氧化物催化剂是主要的两类。铂和铬氧化物是这些类别中最具代表性的催化剂。特别是，铂基催化剂被UOP在Oleflex商业PDH过程中使用，其中催化剂的再生涉及用氯气-空气混合物燃烧焦炭。Pt基催化剂因其在PDH中的高选择性和耐用性而受到青睐，但反应过程中焦炭的形成会严重影响其性能和稳定性。焦炭的形成是由于在高温下涉及中间体和丙烯的深度反应，导致金属催化剂的覆盖和活性位点的阻塞。减少焦炭形成的策略包括与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将Pt与Sn等其他金属合金化，修改支撑物的性质，以及控制Pt催化剂的大小。单Pt原子催化剂的使用也被探索，揭示了在尺寸极限时的不同机制。
