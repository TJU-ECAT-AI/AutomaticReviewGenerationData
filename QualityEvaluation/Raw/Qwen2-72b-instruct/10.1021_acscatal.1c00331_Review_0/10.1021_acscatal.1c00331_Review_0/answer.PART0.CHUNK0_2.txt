[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."
[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C."
[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."
[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."
[5] "The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture."
[6] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."
[7] "However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."
[8] "The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."
[9] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site."
[10] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation."
[11] "The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."
[12] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation."
[13] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."
[14] "The single Pt atom catalyst recently was also examined in PDH, which reveals a different mechanism when reaching the size limit."

1.Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising and effective industrial method for producing propylene on a large scale. The reaction is highly endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. The catalysts used in PDH can be classified into two main types: metal and metal oxide, with platinum and chromium oxide being the most representative examples. Platinum-based catalysts are already used in the Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company, where the regeneration of the catalyst involves the combustion of coke with a chlorine-air mixture. Pt-based catalysts are favored for their high selectivity and durability in PDH, but coke formation during the reaction can significantly degrade catalytic performance and stability. The formation of coke is a result of deep reactions at high temperatures involving intermediates and propylene, leading to the covering of metal catalysts and blocking access to active sites. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane, alloying Pt with other metals such as Sn, modifying the nature of the support, and controlling the size of the Pt catalyst. The use of single Pt atom catalysts has also been explored, revealing a different mechanism when the size limit is reached.

1.催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前景且有效的工业方法，用于大规模生产丙烯。该反应高度吸热，需要超过500摄氏度的温度。PDH中使用的催化剂主要分为两类：金属和金属氧化物，其中铂和铬氧化物是最具代表性的例子。铂基催化剂已经在UOP公司的Oleflex商业PDH过程中使用，其中催化剂的再生涉及用氯气-空气混合物燃烧焦炭。Pt基催化剂因其在PDH中的高选择性和耐用性而受到青睐，但反应过程中焦炭的形成会严重影响催化性能和稳定性。焦炭的形成是由于高温下涉及中间体和丙烯的深度反应，导致金属催化剂被覆盖，阻止了活性位点的访问。减少焦炭形成的策略包括与丙烷共喂入还原气体如氢气，将Pt与Sn等其他金属合金化，修改支撑物的性质，以及控制Pt催化剂的大小。还探索了单Pt原子催化剂的使用，当达到尺寸极限时，揭示了一种不同的机制。
