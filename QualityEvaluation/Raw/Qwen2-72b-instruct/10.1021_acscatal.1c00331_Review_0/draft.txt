1. Comprehensive analysis of catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production: Process characteristics, catalyst performance, and the critical challenge of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a pivotal process for propene production, with a significant focus on optimizing process conditions, catalyst types, and addressing the critical challenge of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.catcom.2007.08.015\]. PDH yields propene, with key factors including temperature and pressure \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. Pt and Cr catalysts face the issue of coke formation, impacting efficiency \[10.1039/d0cs01262a\]. Phosphate and coking-resistant catalysts mitigate coke formation, enhancing regeneration \[10.1039/d0cp04669h\]. The process follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, with propyne aiding CC bond break \[10.1039/d0cs01262a\]. ZrO2 boosts propene production, mitigating coke on Pt-catalysts via in situ regeneration \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\]. PtSn catalysts with water vapor show low coke formation (<1wt%) at 680°C, impacting conversion \[10.1002/anie.201701115\]. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include optimizing H2, H2O, hydrocarbon pressure, space time, linear velocity, and improving catalyst composition \[10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. Pt/Cu single atom alloys boost propene yield, mitigate coke formation, and regeneration restores activity \[10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8\]. PtZn4 in Pt1M1 IMA SACs boosts selectivity and stability, preventing coke formation \[10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008\]. PtGaPb/SiO2 catalysts achieve high propene selectivity and stability at high temperatures, minimizing coke \[10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can further mitigate coke formation while maintaining high selectivity and activity. The exploration of single-atom catalysts and intermetallic alloys, as demonstrated by PtZn4 and PtGaPb/SiO2, presents a promising direction for enhancing PDH efficiency \[10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008, 10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9\]. Additionally, the optimization of reaction conditions, such as pressure and temperature, in conjunction with the use of water vapor and hydrogen, could lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes \[10.1002/anie.201701115, 10.1039/d0cs00983k\]. The integration of advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of coke formation and guide the design of more effective catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_0\]. Moreover, the development of in situ regeneration techniques, as exemplified by the use of ZrO2 for in situ regeneration \[10.1038/s41467-018-06174-5\], could significantly enhance the longevity and efficiency of PDH catalysts. These directions hold the potential to revolutionize the PDH process, leading to more sustainable and economically viable propene production.
