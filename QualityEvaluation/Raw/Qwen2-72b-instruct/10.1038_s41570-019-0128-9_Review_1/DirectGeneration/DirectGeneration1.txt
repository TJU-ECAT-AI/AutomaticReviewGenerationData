In a comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH (Oxidative Dehydrogenation) reactions, several key aspects emerge regarding performance, selectivity, and the impact of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts exhibit a unique ability to promote CO2 conversion, offering higher selectivity towards desired products like ethylene and propylene due to their synergistic effect between iron, nickel, and ceria. The presence of CeO2 as a support enhances redox properties, facilitating the regeneration of active sites and improving catalyst stability. In contrast, vanadium oxide catalysts, known for their high activity in various oxidation reactions, show a different selectivity profile, often favoring the formation of CO and CO2 as byproducts. The composition of these catalysts plays a crucial role; for instance, the ratio of Fe to Ni in FexNiy/CeO2 and the loading of vanadium in vanadium oxide catalysts can significantly influence the reaction pathways and product distribution. Moreover, the choice of support materials, such as alumina or silica, can alter the acidity and basicity of the catalyst surface, affecting the adsorption and activation of reactants and thus the overall reaction mechanism. This comparative study highlights the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support properties, and reaction conditions in determining the efficiency and selectivity of CO2-ODH processes.
