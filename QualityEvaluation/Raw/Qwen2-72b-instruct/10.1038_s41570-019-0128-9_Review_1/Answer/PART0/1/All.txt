Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by support interactions. DFT calculations and isotopic labeling experiments suggest that both one-step and two-step pathways are possible for CO2-ODH over V-based catalysts. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is common in V-based catalysts, and increased participation of oxygen atoms from the support, such as CeO2, improves alkene selectivity. CeO2 inclusion enhances oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration compared to pure ZrO2. Mixed-oxide supports have better activity due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. Acidic supports interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species result in low alkene yield, highlighting dispersion's role in controlling selectivity. DFT studies show that the optimal size of V2O5 on supports like SiO2 or CeO2 differs. Dimers have a kinetic preference for the rate-determining H-abstraction step. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, but conversion decreases from 60% to 20% within one cycle. This performance is maintained for eight reaction-regeneration cycles. The development of V2O5 catalysts is promising, but acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns regarding V2O5 dust remain challenges. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has high CO selectivity (>98%) through the dry reforming (DR) pathway. The selectivities remain stable at comparable C2H6 conversions, indicating intrinsic kinetic differences. C2H4 is the primary product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting its potential as a CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, whereas Fe/CeO2 is less effective. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites involving Fe-Ni interaction.", "Chinese": "钒氧化物催化剂，如V2O5，其活性和选择性受支撑材料性质的影响，支撑材料影响还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。支撑VOx催化剂比纯V2O5更具选择性，因为支撑材料的相互作用可以稳定特别活跃的VOx表面结构。DFT计算和同位素标记实验表明，V基催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中，无论是单步氧化脱氢途径还是包含RWGS反应的两步途径都是可能的。大多数V基催化剂通过Mars van Krevelen机制运行，支撑材料中氧原子的更大参与可以提高烯烃的选择性，如在C4H10的CO2-ODH反应中观察到的V2O5/CeO2ZrO2。CeO2作为支撑材料的一部分，与纯ZrO2相比，增加了氧的流动性和空位浓度，同时产生了一些CeVO4。一般来说，混合氧化物支撑材料比单一氧化物具有更好的活性，因为它们具有更大的酸碱双功能。如果支撑材料只有酸性，那么它们只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致这种氧化物形成分散不良的晶体。事实上，聚合V物种导致低烯烃产量，再次表明分散性是控制选择性的关键因素。DFT研究揭示了支撑材料上可能的VOx物种（单体、二聚体、聚合体，与纯体相比）的差异，当选择SiO2或CeO2作为支撑材料时，V2O5的最佳尺寸不同。此外，尽管没有能量偏好于更大或更小的物种，但二聚体在动力学上具有偏好，因为它们可以比其他物种更快地执行速率决定性的氢抽象步骤。因此，考虑到这些观察结果，已经证明V2O5分散在介孔SiO2纳米球中，在8小时周期内可以表现出90%的丙烯选择性，转化率在一次循环内从60%下降到20%。这种催化性能仅在八个反应-再生循环（64小时在线）中得以维持。总的来说，V2O5催化剂的开发前景光明，但酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战依然存在，V2O5粉尘的健康问题也值得关注。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中显示出高C2H4选择性（>75%），而Fe1Ni3/CeO2通过干重整（DR）途径具有高CO选择性（>98%）。在相当的C2H6转化率下，选择性几乎不变，表明差异源于内在动力学。通过考虑C2H4选择性随Fe3Ni1/CeO2上C2H6转化率的变化，我们发现C2H4是主要的反应产物，推测Fe3Ni1/CeO2是一种有前景的CO2-ODH催化剂。值得注意的是，Ni/CeO2是一种优秀的重整催化剂，而Fe/CeO2对这两种反应都是较差的催化剂。因此，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH中表现出的高选择性可以推断为源自Fe与Ni之间独特的活性位点。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1"},
