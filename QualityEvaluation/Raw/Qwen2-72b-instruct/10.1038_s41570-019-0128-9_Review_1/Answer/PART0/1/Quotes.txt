          [12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
          [13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
          [14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
          [15] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
          [16] "By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst."
          [17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
          [18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

[1] "V oxide catalysts As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion24,65."
          [2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
          [3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."
          [4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69)."
          [5] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
          [6] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70."
          [7] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12."
          [8] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73."
          [9] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
          [10] "In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74."
          [11] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75."
          [12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
          [13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
