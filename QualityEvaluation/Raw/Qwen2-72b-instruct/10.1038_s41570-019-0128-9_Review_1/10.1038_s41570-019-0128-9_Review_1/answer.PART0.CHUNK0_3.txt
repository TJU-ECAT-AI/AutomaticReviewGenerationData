[1] "V oxide catalysts As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion24,65."
[2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."
[4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69)."
[5] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[6] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70."
[7] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12."
[8] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73."
[9] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
[10] "In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74."
[11] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75."
[12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
[13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[15] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[16] "By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1.Vanadium oxide catalysts, like V2O5, have their activity and selectivity influenced by the nature of the support, which affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by support interactions. DFT calculations and isotopic labeling experiments suggest that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway and a two-step pathway involving the RWGS reaction are possible over V-based catalysts. The majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where increased participation of oxygen atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity. The inclusion of CeO2 in the support increases oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, and mixed-oxide supports generally have improved activity due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. Acidic supports interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species result in low alkene yield, highlighting dispersion as a key factor in controlling selectivity. DFT studies reveal that the optimal size of V2O5 on a support depends on the choice of support material, with kinetic preference for dimers due to their faster rate-determining H-abstraction step. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, but the conversion decreases significantly within one cycle. This performance is maintained for eight reaction-regeneration cycles. The development of V2O5 catalysts is promising, but acidic sites that promote alkene cracking and health concerns regarding V2O5 dust remain challenges.
2.Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has high CO selectivity (>98%) through the DR process. The selectivities remain relatively constant at comparable C2H6 conversions, suggesting differences in intrinsic kinetics. C2H4 is the primary product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, indicating its potential as a CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, whereas Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni.
3.Support materials, composition, and structural factors play significant roles in determining the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. CeO2 as a support increases oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, which is beneficial for the CO2-ODH reaction. The composition of the bimetallic catalyst, such as the ratio of Fe to Ni, influences selectivity and activity. Structural factors, including dispersion and the presence of distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni, are crucial for high selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions. Challenges include maintaining high selectivity and activity over multiple cycles and addressing the potential for coking and deactivation. Potential for improvement lies in optimizing the support material, bimetallic composition, and catalyst structure to enhance stability and selectivity.

1. 钒氧化物催化剂，如V2O5，其活性和选择性受支撑材料性质的影响，支撑材料影响还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。支撑VOx催化剂比块状V2O5更具选择性，因为支撑材料的相互作用可以稳定特别活跃的VOx表面结构。DFT计算和同位素标记实验表明，V基催化剂（支撑或非支撑）在CO2-ODH烷烃反应中，可能同时存在一步氧化脱氢途径和涉及RWGS反应的两步途径。大多数V基催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中来自支撑材料的氧原子的更大参与提高了烯烃选择性。在C4H10的CO2-ODH反应中，CeO2作为支撑材料的一部分，增加了氧的流动性和空位浓度，同时产生了一些CeVO4。一般来说，混合氧化物支撑材料比单一氧化物具有更高的活性，因为它们具有更大的酸碱双功能。如果支撑材料只有酸性，那么它们只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致这种氧化物形成分散不良的结晶体。事实上，聚合V物种导致烯烃产量低，再次表明分散性是控制选择性的关键因素。DFT研究揭示了支撑材料上可能的VOx物种（单体、二聚体、聚合体，与块体相比）的大小，当选择SiO2或CeO2作为支撑材料时，V2O5的最优尺寸不同。此外，虽然没有能量偏好于更大或更小的物种，但二聚体有动力学偏好，因为它们可以比其他物种更快地执行速率决定性的氢抽象步骤。考虑到这些观察结果，已经证明V2O5分散在介孔SiO2纳米球中，在8小时周期内可以表现出90%的丙烯选择性，转化率在一个周期内从60%下降到20%。这种催化性能仅在八个反应-再生周期（64小时在线）中保持。总的来说，开发V2O5催化剂的进展是很有希望的，但促进烯烃裂解的酸性位点仍然是一项挑战，而且V2O5粉尘也存在健康问题。
2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出高C2H4选择性（>75%），而Fe1Ni3/CeO2通过DR过程具有高CO选择性（>98%）。在相当的C2H6转化率下，选择性几乎不变，表明差异来自内在动力学。通过考虑C2H4选择性随Fe3Ni1/CeO2上C2H6转化率的变化，我们看到C2H4是主要的反应产物，推测Fe3Ni1/CeO2是一种有前景的CO2-ODH催化剂。值得注意的是，Ni/CeO2是一种优秀的重整催化剂，而Fe/CeO2对这两种反应都是较差的催化剂。因此，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH中表现出的高选择性可以推断为源自Fe与Ni相互作用的特定活性位点。
3. 支撑材料、组成和结构因素在确定FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的性能、挑战和改进潜力方面起着重要作用。CeO2作为支撑材料，增加了氧的流动性和空位浓度，这对CO2-ODH反应是有利的。双金属催化剂的组成，如Fe与Ni的比例，影响选择性和活性。结构因素，包括分散性和Fe与Ni相互作用的特定活性位点的存在，对于CO2-ODH反应中的高选择性至关重要。挑战包括在多个周期中保持高选择性和活性，以及解决潜在的焦化和失活问题。改进的潜力在于优化支撑材料、双金属组成和催化剂结构，以增强稳定性和选择性。
