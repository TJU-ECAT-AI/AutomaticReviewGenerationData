[1] "V oxide catalysts As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion24,65."
[2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."
[4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69)."
[5] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[6] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70."
[7] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12."
[8] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73."
[9] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
[10] "In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74."
[11] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75."
[12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
[13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[15] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[16] "By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1.Vanadium oxide catalysts, like V2O5, exhibit activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions that are influenced by the nature of the support material, which affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by support interactions. The activity of V-based catalysts can follow a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway involving the RWGS reaction. The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is common in V-based catalysts, and increased participation of oxygen atoms from the support, such as CeO2, improves alkene selectivity. CeO2 inclusion in the support enhances oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration compared to pure ZrO2, and mixed-oxide supports generally have improved activity due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. Acidic supports interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species result in low alkene yield, highlighting dispersion as a key factor in controlling selectivity. DFT studies show that the optimal size of V2O5 on supports like SiO2 or CeO2 can differ, and there is a kinetic preference for dimers due to their faster H-abstraction step. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, but the conversion decreases significantly within one cycle. The catalytic performance is maintained for eight reaction-regeneration cycles. The development of V2O5 catalysts is promising, but challenges remain with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns regarding V2O5 dust.
2.Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show high selectivity for C2H4 production in CO2-ODH reactions, with selectivity over 75%. The selectivity remains almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions, suggesting the difference in performance is due to intrinsic kinetics. C2H4 is the primary product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, indicating its potential as a CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni.

The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni. The role of the support material, composition, and structural factors in determining the performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts is significant. CeO2 as a support enhances the activity and stability of the catalyst by providing reactive lattice oxygen atoms that protect the material from coke deposits. The bimetallic composition of Fe3Ni1 allows for selective CH bond cleavage of C2H6 to produce C2H4, distinguishing it from monometallic Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2 catalysts. The structural factors, such as the dispersion and interaction of Fe and Ni on the CeO2 support, play a crucial role in the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. Challenges include the need for further optimization of the bimetallic composition and support material to improve the stability and selectivity of the catalyst for CO2-ODH reactions.

1. 钒氧化物催化剂，如V2O5，在CO2-ODH反应中表现出的活性和选择性受支撑材料性质的影响，支撑材料影响还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。支撑VOx催化剂比块状V2O5更具选择性，因为支撑材料的相互作用可以稳定特别活跃的VOx表面结构。V基催化剂的活性可以遵循一步氧化脱氢途径或涉及RWGS反应的两步途径。大多数V基催化剂通过Marsvan Krevelen机制运行，支撑材料如CeO2中氧原子的参与增加可以提高烯烃的选择性。CeO2作为支撑材料的加入，与纯ZrO2相比，增强了氧的流动性和空位浓度，并提供了一些CeVO4。混合氧化物支撑材料通常由于更大的酸碱双功能而具有改善的活性。如果支撑材料仅具有酸性，那么它们只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致该氧化物形成分散不良的晶体。聚集体V物种导致烯烃产量低，再次表明分散性是控制选择性的关键因素。DFT研究显示，与SiO2或CeO2作为支撑材料时，V2O5的最优尺寸可以不同，尽管没有能量偏好于更大或更小的物种，但存在动力学偏好于二聚体，因为它们可以比其他物种更快地执行速率决定性的H-抽提步骤。考虑到这些观察结果，已经证明分散在介孔SiO2纳米球中的V2O5在8小时循环中可以表现出90%的丙烯选择性，转化率在一个循环内从60%下降到20%。这种催化性能仅在八个反应-再生循环（64小时在线）中保持。总的来说，V2O5催化剂的发展前景看好，但酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战依然存在，V2O5粉尘的健康问题也值得关注。
2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中显示出对C2H4生产的高选择性，选择性超过75%。在可比较的C2H6转化率下，选择性几乎保持不变，表明性能差异是由于内在动力学。C2H4是Fe3Ni1/CeO2上的主要产物，表明其作为CO2-ODH催化剂的潜力。Ni/CeO2是一种优秀的重整催化剂，而Fe/CeO2对于这两种反应都是较差的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH中表现出的高选择性可以推断为源自Fe与Ni相互作用的特定活性位点。
