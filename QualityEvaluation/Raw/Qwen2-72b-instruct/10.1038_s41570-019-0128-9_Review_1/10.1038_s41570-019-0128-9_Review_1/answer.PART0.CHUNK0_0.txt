[1] "V oxide catalysts As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion24,65."
[2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."
[4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69)."
[5] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[6] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70."
[7] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12."
[8] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73."
[9] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
[10] "In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74."
[11] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75."
[12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
[13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[15] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[16] "By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1.V oxide catalysts, similar to Cr oxide catalysts, have their activity influenced by the nature of the supports, which affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by support interactions. DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments suggest that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway and a two-step pathway involving the RWGS reaction are possible over V-based catalysts. The majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where increased participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity. CeO2 inclusion in the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration, and mixed-oxide supports have improved activity due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. Acidic supports interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species result in low alkene yield, indicating dispersion's role in controlling selectivity. DFT studies show that the optimal size of V2O5 on supports like SiO2 or CeO2 differs, with a kinetic preference for dimers due to faster H-abstraction. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity, but conversion decreases significantly within one cycle. This performance is maintained for eight reaction-regeneration cycles. The development of V2O5 catalysts is promising, but acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns regarding V2O5 dust remain challenges.
2.Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts have shown high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 yields high CO selectivity (>98%) through the DR process. Selectivities remain almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions, suggesting intrinsic kinetic differences. C2H4 is the primary product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, indicating its potential as a CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, whereas Fe/CeO2 is poor for both reactions. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites where Fe interacts with Ni.

1.钒氧化物催化剂与铬氧化物催化剂类似，其活性受支撑材料性质的影响，支撑材料影响还原性、酸碱性和分散性。支撑VOx催化剂比纯V2O5更具选择性，因为支撑材料的相互作用可以稳定特别活跃的VOx表面结构。DFT计算和同位素标记实验表明，V基催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中，无论是一步氧化脱氢途径还是一步途径结合RWGS反应都是可能的。大多数V基催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，支撑材料中O原子的参与增加可以提高烯烃的选择性。在支撑材料中加入CeO2会增加O的流动性和空位浓度，同时产生一些CeVO4。一般来说，混合氧化物支撑材料比单一氧化物具有更好的活性，因为它们具有更强的酸碱双功能。如果支撑材料只有酸性，那么它们只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致这种氧化物形成分散不良的晶体。事实上，聚合V物种导致烯烃产量低，再次表明分散性是控制选择性的关键因素。DFT研究显示，支撑材料上可能的VOx物种（单体、二聚体、聚合体，与纯体相比）的最优大小在选择SiO2或CeO2作为支撑材料时有所不同。此外，尽管没有能量偏好于更大或更小的物种，但二聚体有动力学偏好，因为它们可以比其他物种更快地进行速率决定性的H抽提步骤。因此，考虑到这些观察结果，已经证明分散在介孔SiO2纳米球中的V2O5在8小时循环中可以表现出90%的丙烯选择性，转化率在一个循环内从60%下降到20%。这种催化性能仅在八个反应-再生循环（64小时在线）中保持。总的来说，开发V2O5催化剂的进展是很有希望的，但酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战依然存在，V2O5粉尘的健康问题也是需要考虑的。
2.Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中显示出高C2H4选择性（>75%），而Fe1Ni3/CeO2通过DR过程产生高CO选择性（>98%）。在可比较的C2H6转化率下，选择性几乎不变，这表明差异来自内在动力学。通过考虑C2H4选择性随C2H6在Fe3Ni1/CeO2上的转化率的变化，我们看到C2H4是主要的反应产物，因此推测Fe3Ni1/CeO2是很有潜力的CO2-ODH催化剂。值得注意的是，Ni/CeO2是一种优秀的重整催化剂，而Fe/CeO2对这两种反应都是较差的催化剂。因此，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH中表现出的高选择性可以推断为源自Fe与Ni相互作用的特定活性位点。
