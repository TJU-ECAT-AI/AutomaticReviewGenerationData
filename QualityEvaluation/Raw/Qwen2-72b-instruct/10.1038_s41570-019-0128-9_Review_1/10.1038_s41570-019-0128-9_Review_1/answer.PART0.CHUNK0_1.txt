[1] "V oxide catalysts As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion24,65."
[2] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."
[3] "DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."
[4] "Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69)."
[5] "The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4."
[6] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70."
[7] "If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12."
[8] "Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73."
[9] "A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support."
[10] "In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74."
[11] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75."
[12] "This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream)."
[13] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."
[14] "Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a)."
[15] "The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics."
[16] "By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst."
[17] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions."
[18] "So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d)."

1.V oxide catalysts, like Cr oxide catalysts, have their activity influenced by the nature of the supports due to the effects on reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOx-support interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures. DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible over V-based catalysts. The majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity. The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4. Mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. If the supports are only acidic, they can only interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity. A DFT study revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support, and there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than other species. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20% within one cycle. This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reaction-regeneration cycles (64h on stream). Progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust. In comparison, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the CO2-ODH of C2H6, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR. The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions, suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics. C2H4 is the primary reaction product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, indicating that it is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni.

1.与Cr氧化物催化剂一样，V氧化物催化剂的活性也受到支撑材料性质的影响，这是由于支撑材料对还原性、酸碱性和分散性的影响。支撑VOx催化剂比块状V2O5更具选择性，因为VOx-支撑材料的相互作用可以稳定特别活跃的VOx表面结构。DFT计算和同位素标记实验表明，V基催化剂在CO2-ODH烷烃反应中，既可能有一步氧化脱氢途径，也可能有两步途径，其中包含RWGS反应。大多数V基催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，支撑材料中O原子的更大参与可以提高烯烃的选择性。将CeO2作为支撑材料的一部分，与纯ZrO2相比，可以增加O的流动性和空位浓度，同时提供一些CeVO4。一般来说，混合氧化物支撑材料比单一氧化物具有更高的活性，因为它们具有更大的酸碱双功能。如果支撑材料只有酸性，那么它们只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致这种氧化物形成分散性差的晶体。事实上，聚合V物种导致低烯烃产率，再次表明分散性是控制选择性的关键因素。DFT研究揭示了支撑材料上可能的VOx物种（单体、二聚体、聚合体，与块体相比）的最优大小，当选择SiO2或CeO2作为支撑材料时，V2O5的最优大小不同。此外，虽然没有能量偏好于更大或更小的物种，但二聚体有动力学偏好，因为它们可以比其他物种更快地执行速率决定性的H-抽提步骤。因此，考虑到这些观察结果，已经证明V2O5分散在介孔SiO2纳米球中，在8小时周期内可以表现出90%的丙烯选择性，转化率在一个周期内从60%下降到20%。这种催化性能仅在八个反应-再生周期（64小时在线）中得以维持。总的来说，开发V2O5催化剂的进展是很有希望的，但酸性位点的存在，促进了烯烃的裂解，仍然是一个挑战，而且V2O5粉尘的健康问题也存在。相比之下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在C2H6的CO2-ODH中具有最高的C2H4选择性（>75%），而Fe1Ni3/CeO2通过DR方式具有最高的CO产率（CO选择性>98%）。在可比较的C2H6转化率下，选择性几乎没有变化，这表明差异来自于内在动力学。在Fe3Ni1/CeO2上，C2H4是主要的反应产物，这表明Fe3Ni1/CeO2是一种有前景的CO2-ODH催化剂。值得注意的是，Ni/CeO2是一种优秀的重整催化剂，而Fe/CeO2对这两种反应都是较差的催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH中表现出的高选择性可以推断为源自Fe与Ni相互作用的特定活性位点。
