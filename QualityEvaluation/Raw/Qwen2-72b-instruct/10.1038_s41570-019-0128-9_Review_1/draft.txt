Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1\]. Vanadium oxide catalysts, such as V2O5, exhibit activity and selectivity that are significantly influenced by the nature of the support, which affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures by support interactions. DFT calculations and isotopic labeling experiments suggest that both one-step and two-step pathways are possible for CO2-ODH over V-based catalysts. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is common in V-based catalysts, and increased participation of oxygen atoms from the support, such as CeO2, improves alkene selectivity. CeO2 inclusion enhances oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration compared to pure ZrO2. Mixed-oxide supports have better activity due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. Acidic supports interact weakly with V2O5, leading to poorly dispersed crystallites. Polymeric V species result in low alkene yield, highlighting dispersion's role in controlling selectivity. DFT studies show that the optimal size of V2O5 on supports like SiO2 or CeO2 differs. Dimers have a kinetic preference for the rate-determining H-abstraction step. V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, but conversion decreases from 60% to 20% within one cycle. This performance is maintained for eight reaction-regeneration cycles. The development of V2O5 catalysts is promising, but acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns regarding V2O5 dust remain challenges. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has high CO selectivity (>98%) through the dry reforming (DR) pathway. The selectivities remain stable at comparable C2H6 conversions, indicating intrinsic kinetic differences. C2H4 is the primary product over Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting its potential as a CO2-ODH catalyst. Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, whereas Fe/CeO2 is less effective. The high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH is attributed to distinct active sites involving Fe-Ni interaction.

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity, particularly in the context of CO2-ODH reactions. The role of support materials in controlling the dispersion and stability of active sites is a critical area that warrants further investigation. The development of mixed-oxide supports with optimized acid-base bifunctionality could lead to improved catalyst performance. Additionally, the exploration of alternative metals and their interactions with supports could yield catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. The use of advanced characterization techniques, such as in situ spectroscopy and microscopy, could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the evolution of active sites under reaction conditions. Furthermore, the integration of computational methods, such as DFT calculations, with experimental data could guide the rational design of catalysts with tailored properties. The pursuit of sustainable and environmentally friendly catalysts, addressing health concerns associated with V2O5 dust, is also a crucial direction for future research.
