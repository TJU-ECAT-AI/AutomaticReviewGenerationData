Synthesis of V-MCM-41 Catalysts and Its Application in CO2 Assisted Iso- butane Dehydrogenation Xiaosheng Wang1, Kehong Ji1, Guanglin Zhou1, Qin Li1, Hongjun Zhou1,*, Chunming Xu1 1State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, Institute of New Energy, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Beijing 102249, China *Correspondence: Hongjun Zhou (E-mail: zhouhongjun63@126.com), State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, Institute of New Energy, China University of Petroleum-Beijing, Beijing 102249, China Abstract: A series of V-MCM-41 were in situ synthesized. The textual properties and vanadium species were systematically characterized. The results showed that the catalysts could still maintain mesoporous structure and high specific surface area. The vanadium species were highly dispersed on the surface while polymeric vanadium species co-existed. The iso-butane dehydrogenation was performed by employing CO2 as soft oxidant. The results revealed an almost linear relationship between the activity and surface vanadium sites.
Isolated vanadium species were more active for iso-butane dehydrogenation. The iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2 could proceed simultaneously via oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

1. Introduction
Butene production from butane dehydrogenation is an important aspect of comprehensive utilization of light alkanes.1-3 With the increasing demand of butene derived products from the worldwide market, butene production from butane dehydrogenation process had received much more attention. Besides Pt- or Cr-based catalysts used in the industry (c.a. Oleflex and Catofin), researchers have always been seeking for an alternative with low operation temperature and running cost.4-6 Vanadium based catalysts were investigated pervasively as a promising catalysts for dehydrogenation due to the relatively low price and environmental friendliness.7 After the successful synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials in 1990s, the research on vanadium based catalyst was further promoted and developed. Many researches were focused on improving the activity, selectivity and stability of vanadium containing mesoporous materials since then.
Vanadium containing mesoporous siliceous catalysts were demonstrated to be active for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.8-12 It is widely acknowledged that the catalytic performance of the vanadium based catalyst was largely determined by the valance state and form of the vanadium species13-15. Bulnek reported that the side reaction was rather severe over V2O5 particles in oxidative reaction of n-butane.16 Al-Ghamdi summarized that VOx coverage in the sub-monolayer region was more favored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.17 Zhang pointed out that monomeric tetrahedral coordinated vanadium species were active for propane and iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction.18 The valance state of vanadium species was also deemed as a key point for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Many researchers had proved that V3+ showed a close relationship with the catalysts activity.19 To increase the catalytic performance, much researches has been conducted to improve the dispersion of vanadium species.20-24 Among those were the in situ synthesis of vanadium based mesoporous catalysts. Compared with the traditional impregnation method, vanadium species were more evenly distributed and less likely to aggregate on catalysts derived from in situ synthesized method. In this paper, we employed methanol as a medium to combine organic vanadium precursor with silica source. The structure properties and vanadium species were carefully investigated. To overcome deep oxidation reaction, dehydrogenation performance of iso-butane of the catalysts were tested by employing CO2 as soft oxidant.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalysts preparation
The vanadium containing MCM-41 was synthesized by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, A.R., Sinopharm) as silicon source and vanadyl (IV) acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, A.R., Energy Chemical) as vanadium source. The preparation process was based on literature 25 with some modifications.
Typically, 12.5 g of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, A.R., Sinopharm product) and 75.0 g of ammonia solution (25%, A.R., Beijing Chemical Works) were added to 200.0 g of deionized water and stirred thoroughly until a clear solution was obtained, denoted as solution A. Certain amount of VO(acac)2 was added to 300.0 g methanol followed by mixing with 60.0 g TEOS, denoted as solution
B. Then solution B was added to solution A dropwise under vigorous stirring. Hereafter, the mixture
was transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and crystallized at 120 C for 48 h. The solid was filtered and washed with copious amount of water until the filtrate showed a neutral pH value. The materials were then dried at 120 C for 10h and calcined at 550 C for 6 hours with a heating ramp of 1 Kmin-1 to remove all the surfactants. Finally, the powder was pressurized and pelletized to 30-40 mesh particles. www.cet-journal.com Page 3 Chemical Engineering & Technology

2.2 Catalysts characterization
XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer provided with Ni filtered Cu-Kα (λ=0.15416 nm) radiation at 40kV and 30mA. The scanning speed was 5 min-1 in the range of
1.3-50 .
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed on an ASAP 2020 (Micromerities) instrument.
The catalysts samples were pretreated at 90 C for 1 hour and degassed at 5.7102 Pa, 350 C for 5 hours. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore volume and pore size distribution were derived from the desorption isotherms using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.
The vanadium content of the calcined catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Optima 7300V). The catalysts were dissolved in the mixture of equivalent volume of concentrated HF and HNO3 solution before test.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on an Autochem 2920 (Micromerities) in the range of 100-800 C. Samples (100 mg) were first treated in dry air at 500 C for 1 h then cooled down to ambient temperature in N2 atmosphere before being reduced in a flow of H2/Ar (10%H2 and a total flow of 50 mlmin-1). The samples were heated up to 800 C at a rate of 10 Kmin-1 and the effluent were monitored by a TCD and a MS detector.
X-Ray Photoelectron spectrum (XPS) were recorded with a K-Alpha (Thermo Fisher) instrument equipped with a multichannel hemispherical electron analyzer, using Al Kα as the exciting radiation at constant pass energy of 149.8 eV. The pressure in the chamber was maintained bellowed 5.0×10-7 Pa and the charge compensation was done with the adventitious C1s peak at 284.6 eV.
The amount of vanadium sites were determined by O2 chemisorption as described by Oyama.26 The schematic diagram of the apparatus was shown in Figure S1 in Support Information. In a typical experiment, 200 mg catalyst was first reduced at 350 C (to avoid over reduction of bulk vanadium oxides) for 10 minutes by 10% H2/Ar gaseous mixture with a heating ramp of 5 Kmin-1. Then the gas was changed to pure Ar and kept at 350 C. Small amounts of O2 (10.291 μmole) was pulsed into the system by a six-way valve and repeated every 60s until the on-line Pfeiffer Prisma Plus (QMG 220) Mass Spectrometry Detector recorded a constant area. The amount of active sites was calculated based on O2 uptake derived from total area difference between the saturation peak and the prior unsaturated ones (assuming Vsurf = Oads).
The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the samples were recorded on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse-reflectance attachment under ambient conditions. The powdery samples were loaded in a quartz cell, and the spectra were collected in 200-800 nm with a
