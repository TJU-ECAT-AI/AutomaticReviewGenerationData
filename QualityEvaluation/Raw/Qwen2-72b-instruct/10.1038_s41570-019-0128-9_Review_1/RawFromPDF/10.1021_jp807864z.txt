Propane dehydrogenation over perfect Ga2O3(100) was studied in detail by periodic density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. It was found that the initial C-H bond activation mainly follows a radical mechanism
that the two-coordinated surface oxygen site (O(2)) abstracts a hydrogen atom from propane with the formation
of propyl radical and hydroxyl group (O(2)H). Physically adsorbed propyl radical can easily form propoxide
or propylgallium intermediate. Subsequently, propene is formed by a second H abstraction from propyl,
propoxide, or propylgallium by surface oxygen and Ga sites. H abstraction by O(2) site always has low
energy barrier. However, it is difﬁcult for the hydrogen atoms in the hydroxyl groups to leave the surface in
the form of either H2 or H2O. In addition, propene formed through H abstraction by oxygen site has high
adsorption energy and is prone to further dehydrogenation or oligomerization, leading to fast deactivation of
the catalyst. On the other hand, the formation of H2 from GaH and hydroxyl group is much easier, although
the formation of GaH has to overcome high energy barrier. Thus, there is a shift of rate-determining step for
propane dehydrogenation: at the initial stage of the reaction, the rate-determining step is H abstraction by
oxygen sites and then it shifts to H abstraction from various propyl sources by Ga sites to form gallium
hydrides after the surface oxygen sites are consumed. Our results also indicate that dehydrogenation of propane
mainly follows a direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDH), whereas oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is
energetically less feasible but cannot be ruled out in the presence of mild oxidant such as CO2.
1. Introduction
Given the ever-increasing worldwide demand for oleﬁns,
alternative inexpensive ways to produce light oleﬁns in industry
are highly desired.1 Propene is a useful raw material for
polymers and a number of chemical products, for example,
polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Direct
dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic process which
requires relatively high temperatures to obtain a high yield of
propene. However, increasing temperatures would favor thermal
cracking of light alkanes to carbon deposition and always lead
to decrease of the product yield. Hence, the development of
highly efﬁcient catalyst has been of interest recently. Besides,
considering the overoxidation in the presence of O2, CO2 also
becomes a promising mild oxidant introduced in the alkanes
dehydrogenation reactions2-10 because CO2 would partially
suppress the catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition through
Boudouard reaction.11,12
In the presence or absence of CO2, a series of metal oxide
catalysts have been studied in the dehydrogenation of alkanes,
and among them Ga2O3 is a highly effective one.13 Many
experimental studies have shown that Ga2O3-based catalysts are
highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of alkanes.11-23
On the gallium oxide catalyst, the selectivity of alkene products
is usually above 90%, and the activity is also good. Furthermore,
Ga2O3 has been widely used as support or promoter in alkanes
aromatization,24,25 nitrogen oxides reduction,26,27 and methanol
synthesis.28,29 Therefore, gallium oxide is a very important oxide
and is of general interest to chemists. However, the high activity
of gallium oxide in light alkane dehydrogenation reaction was
observed only at the initial stage of the reaction. The activity
of catalyst would decrease quickly in 1 h. Micgorczyk30
suggested that carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface may
contribute to the decrease in propene yield and introduced CO2
in the reaction to remove carbon deposition and improve propene
yield. Some results also show that CO2 has a promoting effect
on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2, but a negative
effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.15 In order to under-
stand the rapid decrease of the catalytic activity, a detailed
mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on gallium oxide surface
is necessary.
To pinpoint alkane activation mechanism on gallium oxide
is a great challenge to both experiment and theory. So far, there
is no agreement on the dehydrogenation mechanism of alkanes
on gallium oxide and gallium-containing catalysts. It is generally
accepted that alkane dehydrogenation is a three-step reaction
composed of two consecutive C-H activation steps and a ﬁnal
step of hydrogen desorption from the surface. However, it is
still not very clear in what form, mainly in H2 or H2O, hydrogen
desorbs from the surface at the initial stage of the reaction. If
it is H2, the reaction mechanism is a direct dehydrogenation
(DDH) mechanism, and if not, the reaction mechanism is an
oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) mechanism. ODH reaction
is thermodynamically favorable but leads to the reduction of
the surface and thus oxidant is needed to reoxidize the catalyst
to continue the catalytic cycle, or the activity of the catalyst
would decrease with the consuming of oxygen in the catalyst.
O2 is widely used as oxidant but it leads to deep oxidation of
alkane and decrease of alkene selectivity. Mild oxidant such as
CO2 can be used. Noticing that propane dehydrogenation
reaction could react in the presence or absence of CO2, Yue

and co-worker14,15 proposed that ODH mechanism is in-
applicable to gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide because
gallium oxide is hard to reduce.24 However, recent TPR
experiment found that on the gallium oxide 30% of O was
removed as H2O during the reduction in H2 at 823 K, a typical
reaction temperature for alkane dehydrogenation on Ga2O3.23
In addition, DDH mechanism cannot explain some experimental
results; for example, in the reoxidation of gallium oxide by CO2
after treatment with H2 and C3H8, the amount of CO after H2
treatment is much lower than that after C3H8 treatment.17
Theoretically, only van Santen et al. have studied the possibility
of forming H2O from the dehydrogenation of ethane over
isolated gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in
oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite.31 They found that the formation of
H2 is highly endothermic and requires high activation energy,
while the recombination of hydroxyl and hydride leading to
reduction of [HO-Ga-H]+ to Ga+ via H2O elimination is
easier.
Another unsettled issue in the reaction mechanism is the role
of Ga sites in the C-H bond activation. It is well-known that
the acid or basic property of the active sites is of crucial
importance for the activity of metal oxide catalysts in many
reactions. For some acid oxide catalysts, for example Ga2O3,
ZnO, CuO, Fe2O3, W2O3, and Al2O3, the Lewis acid sites, i.e.,
Ga, Zn, Cu, Fe, W, and Al sites, are considered to be more
active in dehydrogenation reactions.13,23,32-40 The role of gallium
sites in the dehydrogenation reactions on supported or unsup-
ported Ga2O3 catalysts have been examined by various studies,
but no agreement has been reached. Some authors14,15,41 proposed
that the C-H bond in propane is polarized by gallium-oxygen
pairs. It is the gallium atom that abstracts hydrogen atom to
form gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide, and then propene
is formed by a second H abstraction by neighboring oxygen
sites. However, an IR experiment suggested that the C-H bond
of ethane is initially activated by unsaturated gallium atom and
results in the formation of hydroxyl and carbon-gallium bond.42
Some experimental results also showed that gallium hydride
can only be detected at elevated temperatures42-44 and Kazansky
et al.42 suggested that it is formed due to subsequent decomposi-
tion of gallium-alkyl species by the gallium sites. In addition,
in the study of alkane dehydrogenation on Ga-doped H-ZSM5
catalyst, Guisnet et al. proposed that gallium sites act as
promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane
dehydrogenation.45 Theoretically, Broclawik et al.46 suggested
that gallium sites play important roles in C-H bond activation.
van Santen et al.31,47 and Nascimento et al.48 have studied the
role of gallium sites in the alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed
by gallium-exchanged zeolite using DFT methods. However,
they concluded that gallium atoms act just as alkyl acceptors.
Fu et al.49-51 have systematically studied the initial C-H
activation of light alkanes on MoO3, WO3, CrO3, and V2O5 metal
oxides employing cluster models. They found that on MoO3,
CrO3, and V2O5 the C-H activation by the MdO acid-base
pair is an unfavorable pathway due to very high energy barrier,
but on WO3 it is a favorable pathway with a low enthalpy barrier
of 43.6 kcal/mol at 873 K due to the high polarity of the WdO
bond. Since Ga-O bonds in Ga2O3 are also highly polar bonds,42
could the C-H activation on the Ga-O acid-base pair be a
favorable pathway?
To date, there is, to our knowledge, no systematic theoretical
work on the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation on gallium
oxide surface. Aiming to gain a clear insight into the dehydro-
genation mechanism of alkanes on the Ga2O3 catalysts, here
we have studied the conversion of propane to propene on pure
gallium oxide surface. It is generally accepted that on metal
oxides propene formation is through the second C-H bond
activation of propoxide. Alternatively, we propose that propene
can be formed not only from chemical adsorbed propyl
intermediate (propylgallium or propoxide) but also from physi-
cally adsorbed propyl radical. Hence, in the present study we
show that (i) the initial C-H bond can be activated by the active
sites on the surface, resulting a propyl radical physically or
chemically absorbed on the surface; (ii) the propoxide or
propylgallium species or propyl radical releases a H atom to
form propene; and (iii) the last step is hydrogen desorption from
the surface in the form of H2 as the major product to complete
the catalytic cycle or in the form of H2O as a minor product
leading to the reduction of the catalyst.
2. Model and Computational Details
Among the four polymorphs (R-, -, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3) of
gallium oxide, -Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation
activity, high thermal stability, and relatively high speciﬁc
surface area.14,52,53 Monoclinic -Ga2O3 belongs to the C2/m
space group with lattice parameters a ) 12.23 Å, b ) 3.04 Å,
c ) 5.80 Å, and  ) 103.70°.54 Four Ga2O3 units exist in a
crystallographic unit cell which consists of two primitive unit
cells (Figure 1a). The lattice is composed of two inequivalent
Ga sites and three inequivalent O sites.55 Half of the gallium
sites are forms of slightly distorted tetrahedron with four oxygen
ions, named Ga(t), and the other half are forms of highly
distorted octahedron with oxygen ions, named Ga(o). As for
oxygen, two different oxygen sites are 3-fold coordinated (one
is shared by one octahedron and two tetrahedron, named O(2),
the other is shared by two octahedron and one tetrahedron,
named O(3)), and the third oxygen sites is 4-fold coordinated
which lies at the corner of three octahedrons and one tetra-
hedrons, named O(4).
-Ga2O3(100)surfacehavebeenstudiedinpreviousstudies.56-60
Bermudez had studied the structure and properties of four
different monoclinic -Ga2O3 surface, showing that (100) surface
is the most stable surface.61 In the present study, Ga2O3(100)
surface is simulated by a unit cell (p(4×2), 12.37 Å × 11.79
Å) with an 20 Å vacuum region between slabs. -Ga2O3(100)
surface is terminated in rows of unsaturated O(2) with each
back-bonded to two tetrahedral gallium Ga(t) sites and of
unsaturated gallium Ga(o) sites with each bonded to two O(3)
sites and O(4) sites (Figure 1b). In the present study, Ga2O3(100)
surface is routinely modeled by a one-layer slab with half of
atoms allowed to relax. It is expected that unsaturated sites are
more active than saturated ones, and thus Ga(t) sites and O(4)
sites have little activity. Hence, we focus on the Ga(o) (named

sites on the Ga2O3(100) surface.
All total energy density functional theory calculations were
carried out using the SIESTA package with numerical atomic
orbital basis sets and Troullier-Martins norm-conserving
pseudopotentials.62,63 The exchange-correlation functional uti-
lized is the generalized gradient approximation PBE method,
known as GGA-PBE.64 A double- polarization basis set (DZP)
was employed. The orbital-conﬁning cutoff radii were deter-
mined from an energy shift of 0.01 eV except for hydrogen,
for which a DZP basis set optimized for H2 was used.65 The
energy cutoff for the real space grid used to represent the density
was set as 150 Ry. To further speed up calculations, the
Kohn-Sham equations were solved by an iterative parallel
diagonalization method that utilizes the ScaLAPACK subroutine
pdsygvx with two-dimensional block cyclically distributed
matrix.36 The Broyden method was employed for geometry
relaxation until the Cartesian forces on each relaxed atom were
all less than 0.1 eV/Å. Only Γ-point was used to sample the
Brillouin zone in our calculations. Spin polarization was
considered during all the calculations.
A constrained minimization scheme was employed to search
the transition states (TS) on the potential energy surface.66,67 A
TS is identiﬁed when the forces on the atoms vanish and the
energy is a maximum along the reaction coordinate but a
minimum with respect to all of the other degrees of freedom.
Energy barrier is determined as the energy difference between
the saddle point and the initial state. Adsorption energy (Eads)
is calculated as
Eads ) E(adsorbate+substrate) - (Eadsorbate + Esubstrate)
where a process with a negative Eads is exothermic.
3. Results and Analysis
3.1. Molecular Adsorption of Propane. We have ﬁrst
examined the molecular absorption of propane on various active
sites. The potential energy surface for the adsorption is found
to be quite ﬂat. The most favorable adsorption site for propane
is near the unsaturated Ga site, and the adsorption energy is
calculated to be -0.7 kcal/mol. The results show that propane
undergoes preliminary weak adsorption on the surface prior to
dissociation. Indeed, it was concluded that hydrocarbon mol-
ecules adsorb weakly on metal sites.46 Considering that the
dehydrogenation of propane is carried out at high temperatures,
propane in the gas phase is more stable than it is on the surface
due to the large entropy contribution of the gas phase molecules.
In agreement with theoretical ﬁndings, no molecular adsorption
of propane has been detected by IR spectroscopy.42
3.2. First Stepsthe Activation of the First C-H Bond.
The C-H bond of the methyl or methylene group of propane
will be broken with n-propoxide or i-propoxide formed on the
surface. It is well-known from thermodynamics that the C-H
bond in the methyl group is stronger than the C-H bond in the
methylene group. Experimental results indicated that the C-H
bond cleavage from the methylene group was more feasible than
that from the methyl group both thermodynamically and
kinetically.68-71 Several theoretical studies also showed that the
energy barrier for breaking the C-H bond of the methyl group
was higher than that of the methylene group.49,72 We have
calculated the energy barriers for hydrogen abstractions by O(2)
site through a radical mechanism and found that the energy
barrier for breaking the methyl C-H bond is 9.2 kcal/mol higher
than that for breaking the methylene C-H bond, which tallies
with previous theoretical study.72 Therefore, in the present study,
we will also focus on the breaking of the methylene C-H bond
as other theoretical studies have done on the dehydrogenation
of propane on V2O572 and MoO349,73 catalysts.
Previous studies suggest that there are two possible mecha-
nisms for the initial C-H bond activation of propane on metal
oxide.49,74 One is heterolytic dissociation mechanism, in which
the acid-base pair (Ga-O) polarizes and then breaks the C-H
bond. Two distinct processes have been considered in the present
study for this mechanism:
C3H8 + O-Ga f OH + C3H7Ga
(1)
C3H8 + Ga-O f GaH + C3H7O
(2)
In process (1) the proton of propane and the negatively charged
propyl fragment C3H7δ- form bonds with the oxygen and
gallium sites, respectively, while in process (2) the negatively
charged H atom forms bond with the gallium site, and the
positively charged propyl group C3H7δ+ forms bond with the
oxygen site.
The other is homolytic dissociation mechanism, in which the
active site pair is composed of two O or two Ga active sites,
and the C-H bond is polarized and activated by O or Ga sites.
There are also two distinct processes:
C3H8 + O-O f OH + C3H7O
(3)
C3H8 + Ga-Ga f GaH + C3H7Ga
(4)
Since there are three types of available active sites (O(2),
O(3), Ga) on the surface, the activation of the initial C-H bond
in propane could result in nine product combinations, namely,
O(2)-Ga,O(3)-Ga,Ga-O(2),Ga-O(3),O(2)-O(2),O(2)-O(3),
O(3)-O(2), O(3)-O(3), and Ga-Ga, where the H atom is
always bonded to the ﬁrst atom, the propyl group is bonded to
the second atom, and to make the discussions brief we have
omitted them. For each product combination, there are two
possible types of pathways. One belongs to a concerted
mechanism (C): active site pair Ga-O, O-O, or Ga-Ga
activates the C-H bond of propane and then in one elementary
reaction step the propane reacts with two adjacent atoms on
the surface in a concerted way. These pathways feature cyclic
TSs, involving 4e in these processes.49 The other one belongs
to a radical mechanism (R): the oxygen or gallium active site
activates the C-H bond of propane, and abstracts an H atom
directly from propane, involving 2e in these processes. Subse-
quently, the propyl radical either physically adsorbs on the
surface, or rebinds to an adjacent surface atom, or desorbs into
gas phase. To further simplify the discussion, the pathways
leading to the nine product combinations could be classiﬁed
into three groups according to the active site bonded to hydrogen
in the products: (i) O(2) site pathways O(2)-X-C and
O(2)-X-R; (ii) O(3) site pathways O(3)-X-C and O(3)-X-R;
(iii) Ga site pathways Ga-X-C and Ga-X-R, where X )
O(2), O(3), and Ga.
3.2.1. O(2) Site Pathways. (a) O(2)-X-C. The energy
proﬁles of these pathways and the structures of the cyclic TSs
are depicted in Figure 2. The O(2)-Ga site pair can be regarded
as a Lewis acid-base pair since the active site pair is formed
by a positively charged gallium atom and a negatively charged
oxygen atom. This step is 9.9 kcal/mol endothermic with an
energy barrier of 25.3 kcal/mol (TS1, Figure 2), which is lower
than the barrier for the initial methane activation (28.7 kcal/
mol)46 but is higher than the barrier for the initial ethane
activation (16.8 kcal/mol)47 on the zeolite-supported gallium
atom. For the homolytic activation on the O(2)-O(2) site pair,
the process is -8.9 kcal/mol exothermic with an energy barrier
20384
J. Phys. Chem. C, Vol. 112, No. 51, 2008
Liu et al.
of 38.8 kcal/mol (TS2). For the activation on the O(2)-O(3)
site pair, a cyclic transition state could not be located by any
means. In addition, forming the O(2)-O(3) product combina-
tions is 20.1 kcal/mol endothermic. Therefore, compared to the
O(2)-Ga and O(2)-O(2) site pairs the activation on the
O(2)-O(3) site pairs is unfavorable. Overall, for the concerted
mechanism the activation on the O(2)-Ga site pairs is more
favorable than that on the O(2)-O(2) site pairs.
(b) O(2)-X-R. As for the radical mechanism (R), all
pathways share the same initial step, i.e., H abstraction by the
same O(2) site. As can be seen from Figure 2, the energy barrier
for the ﬁrst H abstraction from propane is 18.1 kcal/mol. A
physically adsorbed propyl radical is formed and its adsorption
energy is 4.5 kcal/mol. Then the physically adsorbed propyl
radical may become chemically adsorbed by forming chemical
bond with adjacent active sites, i.e., O(2), O(3), Ga, and the
newly formed O(2)H group. The bonding with the newly formed
O(2)H will be discussed later. Here we will focus on the other
three sites. The energetics indicate that the propyl radical prefers
to form bond with the nearest Ga and O(2) sites, since the energy
barriers to form chemically adsorbed propyl on the two sites
are just 4.4 and 5.5 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas on the O(3)
site the barrier is 12.0 kcal/mol. Another possibility is the
desorption of the physically adsorbed propyl radical into the
gas phase with a desorption energy of 4.5 kcal/mol. Since
forming the O(2)-O(3) product combination is most endother-
mic and needs to overcome very high energy barrier, propyl is
unlikely to form a bond with the O(3) site. On the other hand,
the adsorption of propyl on the O(2) site is strongly exothermic
and thus O(2) is a stable adsorption site for propyl.
3.2.2. O(3) Site Pathways. The O(3) site pathways are similar
to the O(2) site pathways except that some TSs could not be
located and the energy proﬁles for pathways with TS located
are shifted to higher energies since O(3)H group is less stable
than O(2)H group. The energy barrier of the O(3)-Ga-C
pathway is 16.4 kcal/mol (Figure 3) higher than that of the
O(2)-Ga-C pathway. In addition, this reaction is highly
endothermic with a reaction energy of 31.1 kcal/mol, and the
resulting product is much less stable than that formed through
theO(2)-Gapathways.FortheO(3)-O(2)-CandO(3)-O(3)-C
pathways, the cyclic TS structures could not be located. This
may be due to the lower ability of the O(3) site to abstract
hydrogen and the lower stability of the O(3)H group or
C3H7O(3) intermediate. Our previous study on V2O5-catalyzed
propane dehydrogenation also showed that the 3-fold coordi-
nated O(3) sites are the most inert sites.72
For the O(3)-X-R pathways, the energy barrier of the
H-abstraction step is 39.4 kcal/mol, which is also much higher
than that of the corresponding O(2) pathways. To form C3H7Ga
intermediate, an additional energy barrier of 20.6 kcal/mol has
to be overcome. The TS structure for forming C3H7O(2)
intermediate could not be located. Although the energy barrier
for forming C3H7O(3) is just 6.5 kcal/mol, the formed C3H7O(3)
intermediate is very unstable with a reverse energy barrier of
just 0.9 kcal/mol. This is similar to the formation of C3H7O(3)
intermediate from O(2)H + C3H7(ad) pair (Figure 2) where the
reverse energy barrier from O(2)H + C3H7O(3) to O(2)H +
C3H7(ad) is also very low. Therefore, we are unlikely to observe
C3H7O(3) intermediate in the experiment. On the other hand,
C3H7O(2) and C3H7Ga intermediates are more likely to be
captured by experimental techniques since they fall into deeper
potential energy wells.
3.2.3. Ga Site Pathways. All the TSs for the activation of
the initial C-H bond by the Ga site to form gallium hydride,
either via concerted or radical mechanism, could not be located.
However, experiments have observed the existence of the Ga-H
bond.42 van Santen and co-workers have also failed to locate
the TS to form gallium hydride on the GaO+ species stabilized
on zeolite,31,47 and they proposed indirect pathways to form
gallium hydride.35 Here, we have also studied a similar pathway
to form gallium hydride via a radical mechanism. As mentioned
above when discussing the O(2) site pathways, the physically

adsorbed propyl radical can become chemically adsorbed by
forming bond with the newly formed O(2)H group, leading to
an alcohol-like intermediate. The energy barrier for this process
is 11.2 kcal/mol (in Figure 4). Then the adjacent Ga site abstracts
the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group of the alcohol-like
intermediate. The energy barrier of this hydrogen migration step
is 40.5 kcal/mol. Since this hydrogen migration step is the rate-
determining step to form gallium hydride, the overall energy
barrier to form gallium hydride from the gas phase propane is
the relative energy between the H-migration transition state
(TS12) to the initial reactants, and it is 58.9 kcal/mol, a little
too high. Therefore, gallium hydride may not be formed by this
mechanism due to the high hydrogen-migration barrier.
The above results indicate that the ﬁrst C-H bond of propane
is mainly activated by the O(2) site through a stepwise radical
mechanism. Recent DFT study on MoO3-catalyzed light alkane
dehydrogenation using cluster models also found that the radical
mechanism is energetically preferred for both methane50 and
propane49 dehydrogenations. However, our previous study of
propane activation on V2O5(001) surface indicates that an oxo-
insertion mechanism, i.e., the oxygen atom inserts into the C-H
bond forming an alcoholic intermediate and then the H atom
of the hydroxyl group migrates to adjacent sites, is energetically
preferred. We have also considered this mechanism and have
optimized a transition state structurally very similar to the one
optimized on the V2O5(001) surface. However, careful analysis
indicates that this transition state is not really the transition state
connecting the physically adsorbed propane reactant and the
alcoholic intermediate, but the transition state of the second step
of the radical mechanism (TS11 in Figure 4) to form the
alcoholic intermediate as mentioned above when discussing the
Ga site pathways. We further conﬁrmed this by changing the
geometry of this transition state slightly toward the reactants
and then doing a full geometry optimization. (It is worth
mentioning here that IRC analysis has not been implemented
in most periodic software codes yet.) The optimization results
in a propyl radical physically adsorbed on the O(2)H group,
i.e., the intermediate of the H abstraction by the O(2) site
through a radical mechanism (IM1), not the physically adsorbed
propane. It seems that the oxygen sites on the Ga2O3(100)
surface and the V2O5(001) surface behave differently in the
initial C-H activation of propane. In addition, the initial C-H
bond cleavage of propane on the O(3) sites is less feasible
compared to the O(2) sites both thermodynamically and
kinetically. However, since the ﬁrst step is not the rate-
determining step in the reaction (see the discussions below),
the possibility of the O(3) sites as the reaction center of propane
activation cannot be ruled out.
It is very interesting to see that both the concerted and the
stepwise radical mechanisms predict an easy formation of
alkyl-gallium species and hydroxyl groups. This is in good
agreement with recent experimental results that strong DRIFTS
(diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectrum) bands
of ethyl-gallium and hydroxyl groups have been observed after
heating Ga2O3 in ethane atmosphere at 423 K.42 The same
experiment also indicates that dissociative adsorption of ethane
starts already at room temperature. Previous theoretical study51
have shown that the initial activation of the C-H bond by the
MdO acid-base pair via a concerted mechanism is governed
by the polarity of the MdO bond. Our results show that C-H
bond activation via the concerted mechanism is energetically
more feasible on the gallium oxides than on other metal oxides
due to the high polarity of the GaO bond, although it is
energetically less favorable than the activation via the radical
mechanism.42
3.3. Second StepsPropene Formation. There are two
distinct pathways to form propene after the breaking of the ﬁrst
C-H bond: the losing of a hydrogen atom from either the
physically adsorbed propyl radical or the chemically adsorbed
propyl species, i.e., propoxide or propylgallium species. The
formed propene then desorbs from the surface. Different from
the initial C-H bond activation, the second hydrogen atom can
be abstracted not only by nearby oxygen active sites, i.e., O(2),
O(3), and the newly formed O(2)H groups, but also by the
unsaturated Ga sites.
3.3.1. From Physically Adsorbed Propyl Radical. The energy
proﬁles and all TSs for the second H abtraction from propyl
radical with the ﬁrst hydrogen atom abstracted from propane
bonded to O(2) are shown in Figure 5. Those for the H
abtraction from propyl radical with the ﬁrst hydrogen atom
bonded to O(3) site show similar trend except that the energy
proﬁles are signiﬁcantly lifted to higher energies (by more than
20 kal/mol) due to the fact that O(3)H groups are much less
stable than O(2)H groups. These energy proﬁles and TS
structures are available in the Supporting Information.
The results show that the abilities of different sites to abstract
H atom from propyl are in the order of O(2) > O(3) > O(2)H
> Ga. For the V2O5 surface, Fu et al.72 found that the
H-abstraction abilities of the lattice O sites and surface OH
groups are similar. However, on the Ga2O3(100) surface the
activity of the O sites decreases a lot once they have become
hydroxyl groups. We have also tried to search the TSs for the
initial C-H bond activation of propane by hydroxyl groups.
However, all our efforts have failed. Therefore, the partially
reduced Ga2O3(100) surface has lower activity than the un-
reduced surface. It can be seen from Figure 5 that propene
formation through H abstraction by O(2) has the lowest energy
barrier (4.5 kcal/mol), and the highest one is through H
abstraction by Ga (29.6 kcal/mol). Taking all the three steps to
form the gaseous propene product into consideration, i.e., the
formation of propyl radical, the formation of physically adsorbed
propene, and the desorption of propene from the surface, it can

Liu et al.
be seen that the most energetically preferred pathway is H
abstraction by the O(2) sites at both the ﬁrst and second steps
of the C-H bond activation. The second energetically preferred
pathway is ﬁrst H abstraction by O(2) sites and then second H
abstraction by O(3) sites. The least feasible pathway is ﬁrst H
abstraction by the O(2) sites and then second H abstraction by
Ga sites. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lowest-energy
pathway to form propene is on O(2) sites, but it can also occur
on Ga sites at high temperatures leading to the formation of
gallium hydrides. The formation of gallium hydrides via this
mechanism is energetically much more feasible than the indirect
mechanism discussed above. This conclusion is in agreement
with the recent experimental results for ethane adsorption on
Ga2O3 that gallium hydrides are detected by IR spectrum at high
temperatures.42
Electron-afﬂuent molecules donate electrons easily to surface
active sites and are thus strongly adsorbed on the surface.75 It
can be seen that propene formed by O(3) abstraction or O(2)H
group has high desorption energy (more than 9 kcal/mol).
Charge analysis indicates that there is signiﬁcant electron
transfer from propene to surface hydroxyl groups. Hence the
obtained propene on the O(3) sites and OH group may lead to
deep dehydrogenation products such as carbon deposition and
results in fast deactivation of the Ga2O3 catalyst17 or the
formation of aromatic byproducts.23 This is not surprising
because it has been found that the acid sites of the catalyst is
favorable for coke formation76 and further oligomerization of
the adsorbed propene.77
3.3.2. From i-Propoxide Intermediates. C3H7O(2) is the most
stable form of the chemically adsorbed propyl on the surface.
C3H7O(3) is less stable. To form propene, the adjacent active
sites, for example O(2), O(3), Ga, and surface O(2)H group
must abstract one methyl hydrogen from either C3H7O(2) or
C3H7O(3). However, our searches for TSs starting from
C3H7O(3) either failed or all the optimized TSs have exactly
the same geometries as those optimized starting from the
physically adsorbed propyl radical. It seems that the C-O bond
of the C3H7O(3) intermediate has to be completely broken before
C3H7O(3) further reacts with surface active sites to produce
propene since the energy barrier for breaking C-O(3) bond is
low (see Figures 2 and 3). For those starting from C3H7O(2),
the located TS structures for H abstraction by O(3) and O(2)H
group are also exactly the same as those from physically
adsorbed propyl radical as discussed above. Thus, in Figure 6a
only two pathways, H abstraction by O(2) and Ga, are presented.
Both pathways start from the O(2)H and C3H7O(2) product pair
resulting from the initial C-H bond activation of propane on
O(2) site. Those pathways starting from the O(3)H + C3H7O(2)
product pair show similar trend and are available in the
Supporting Information. As expected, the most feasible pathway
to produce propene is H abstraction by adjacent O(2) site, with
an energy barrier of 19.8 kcal/mol. This process is exothermic
and leads to one more surface O(2)H group. On the other hand,
the energy barrier for H abstraction by Ga site is much higher,
reaching to 57.6 kcal/mol. This process is endothermic and leads
to gallium hydride on the surface.
We have examined the possibility of the reaction of propoxide
with adjacent O(2)H, O(3)H, and Ga(2)H groups to form
propene and H2 in one step. For the O(2)H and O(3)H groups
such concerted TS structures could not be located. As discussed
above, it is difﬁcult to generate gallium hydride from H
abstraction from propyl, propoxide, or propylgallium (see
below). However, once it is produced, we did locate the
concerted transition state for its reaction with propoxide to form
propene and H2. The TS structure is shown in Figure 5. In this
transition state, the C-O bond is elongated from 1.50 Å in
propoxide to 2.97 Å, the positively charged -hydrogen of the
propoxide approaches the negatively charged “hydride” hydro-
gen bound to Ga with an H-H distance of 1.11 Å, and the
Ga-H bond is elongated to 1.79 Å. This is an endothermic
process with a reaction energy of 24.6 kcal/mol. The energy
barrier for this process is 31.7 kcal/mol. Since the subsequent
desorption of propene and H2 from surface requires just a small
amount of energy, the overall energy barrier to form propene
and H2 from the initial reactants through this mechanism is about
48.6 kcal/mol. van Santen et al. have also optimized a similar
transition state for the activation of ethane catalyzed by Ga-
exchanged zeolite, and the energy barrier calculated is 39.6 kcal/
mol.47
3.3.3. From i-Propylgallium Intermediate. Unlike those
pathways starting from the i-propoxide intermediate, the transi-
tion state for the concerted H2 formation from H abstraction by
GaH could not be located. The energy proﬁles of the pathways
starting from the O(2)H + C3H7Ga pair are shown in Figure 7.
Those starting from the O(3)H + C3H7Ga product pair show
similar trend and are available in the Supporting Information.
The results show that H abstraction by the nearest O(2) site
has the lowest-energy barrier of just 13.6 kcal/mol, and this
process is -9.6 kcal/mol exothermic. H abstraction by Ga sites
is less feasible and has to overcome an energy barrier of 38.8
kcal/mol.
Summarizing the above results, O(2) sites, Ga sites, and GaH
sites are efﬁcient active sites in propene formation. The lowest-
energy pathway for propene formation is through H abstraction
by O(2) sites. At high temperatures, propene formation on Ga

sites and GaH sites cannot be ruled out. Besides, it is obvious
that energy barriers for H abstraction by O(3) sites and O(2)H
groups are not high, but the desorption energy of the formed
propene is very high, indicating that these two pathways are
easy to produce side products and lead to fast deactivation of
the catalyst.
3.4. Third StepsH2 or H2O Formation. To complete the
catalytic cycle, the two H atoms abstracted from propane must
eventually desorb from the surface. Zheng et al. suggested that
H2 is produced from adjacent hydroxyl group and gallium
hydride.14 Using in situ transmission infrared spectroscopy,
Collins et al. also reached the same conclusion that when T >
650 K H2 is released from surface Ga-H and Ga-OH species.44
However, Takahara et al. found that on the gallium oxide 30%
of O was removed as H2O during the reduction in H2 at 823
K.23 Here we will ﬁrst study the migration of H atoms between
different surface sites and then examine all the possible pathways
to form H2 and H2O on the Ga2O3 (100) surface.
3.4.1. Migration of H Atom on the Surface. In order to form
H2 or H2O, nonadjacent H atoms have to move to adjacent sites.
The energy barriers for the H migration from nonadjacent sites
to adjacent sites are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, H
migration between different surface sites has to overcome high
energy barriers, especially H migration from O(2) site to Ga
site to form gallium hydride, for which the energy barrier is
76.9 kcal/mol. On the contrary, the energy barrier for the H
abstraction (TS14, 29.6 kcal/mol) from physically adsorbed
propyl radical by gallium to form gallium hydride is much lower
than the energy barrier for the H migration from hydroxyl group
to gallium site. Thus, the experimentally observed gallium
hydride is most likely formed through direct H abstraction from
various propyl intermediates by Ga sites, not through H
migration from adjacent hydroxyl groups. It is also likely that
surface hydrogen atoms cannot migrate to their energetically
preferred bonding sites before forming H2 or H2O since the
energy barriers for the latter processes are relatively low (see
below).
3.4.2. H2 Formation Ws H2O Formation. The catalytic cycle
is completed via the release of H2 or H2O from adjacent
hydroxyl groups or hydride groups on the surface, and if it is
H2O formation, then it has to be followed by reoxidization of
the catalyst. Energy proﬁles from various surface hydrogen
sources to form H2 or H2O are shown in Figure 8. For the
O(2)H-O(3)H pair, the transition state forming H2 could not
be located because the distance between O(2) and O(3) is very

long and the two transition states located are both for forming
surface water (one for H2O(2) and one for H2O(3)). For the
O(3)H-O(3)H pair, no transition states for forming either H2
or H2O could be located. H2 formation from GaH-GaH pair
could not be located either, probably due to the very long
distance between Ga sites. For all other three pairs, O(2)H-O(2)H
(Figure 8a), O(2)H-GaH (Figure 8b), and O(3)H-GaH (Figure
8c), forming H2 always has lower energy barrier than forming
H2O. Forming H2 from the O(3)H-GaH pair has the lowest
energy barrier of just 9.5 kcal/mol, followed by forming H2 from
the O(2)H-GaH pair (14.7 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the
lowest energy barrier for the formation of surface water from
two adjacent hydrogen atoms is 20.3 kcal/mol (TS27).
As discussed above (see Figure 5), for the formation of H2O
there is a low-energy pathway through H abstraction from
physically adsorbed propyl by surface O(2)H groups. Through
this pathway, forming surface H2O needs only an overall energy
of 43.1 kcal/mol. However, the adsorbed H2O is strongly bonded
to the surface by two O-Ga bonds and our accurate calculation
indicates that its desorption energy is more than 13 kcal/mol.
On the other hand, the desorption energy of H2 is quite small,
less than 1 kcal/mol (see Figure 6b). Thus, the overall energy
barrier for the formation of H2 is about 44 kcal/mol since
processes forming GaH are rate-determining steps (see also
Figure 6). We can conclude that formation of gaseous H2 is
easier than the formation of gaseous H2O. However, the
formation of surface H2O is easier than the formation of surface
H2. At high reaction temperatures, H2O can desorb from the
surface, creating oxygen vacancies and leading to the reduction
of the surface. If no oxidant is used to reoxidize the surface,
this process will cause the decrease of the activity of the Ga2O3
catalyst. This is in agreement with experimental results that in
the presence of CO2 the activity of the Ga2O3 decreases much
slower at the initial stage of the reaction.14,15,78 The ﬁnding could
also explain the experimental result that the amount of CO with
the treatment by H2 is much lower than with C3H8 in the
reoxidation of gallium oxide by CO2 after treatment with H2
and C3H8.17
4. General Discussion
We now have a whole picture on the dehydrogenation of
propane. The low-energy pathways are presented in Figure 9.
4.1. Role of Active Sites. From Figure 9 and the discussions
above, it can be seen that the activation of the ﬁrst C-H bond
of propane is mainly through the direct H abstraction by the
O(2) sites via a radical mechanism but not by gallium sites as
proposed by some experimental studies.14,15,41 C-H activation
by Ga-O acid-base pair via a concerted mechanism does have
a low energy barrier comparable to that of C-H activation by

and (d) O(2)H-O(3)H pair. All energies are relative to the initial reactants C3H8(g) + Ga2O3(100) surface, and C3H6(g) is included when the
relative energies are calculated.

the WdO acid-base pair.51,73 However, this energy barrier is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the direct H abstraction by the
O(2) site. Experimentally observed gallium-carbon bonds42 are
thus formed from the bonding of the physically adsorbed propyl
radicals to the gallium sites and also from direct C-H bond
activation by Ga-O via a concerted mechanism at elevated
temperatures.
H abstraction from propane by O(2) leads to the formation
of surface O(2)H groups and physically adsorbed propyl radical.
Physically adsorbed propyl radical can form chemical bond with
O(2) or Ga site to form C3H7O(2) or C3H7Ga intermediate.
Subsequently, O(2) site further abstracts a second hydrogen atom
from the propyl radical, C3H7O(2), or C3H7Ga intermediate, and
propene is then formed. These processes have relatively low
energy barriers and the lowest-energy pathway is through H
abstraction from propyl radical by O(2) site with the formation
of propene and O(2)H group. Figure 2 also indicates that the
formation of surface O(3)H groups via H abstraction from
physically adsorbed propyl radical also has relatively low energy
barrier. Thus, at the initial stage of the reaction, surface hydroxyl
groups are easily formed until most O(2) and O(3) sites become
hydroxyl groups. However, the formed hydroxyl groups are very
stable. From them, the formation of H2 needs to overcome very
high energy barriers while the formation of surface H2O either
needs to overcome very high energy barriers or is an endother-
mic process with high reaction energy. We would expect that
at the initial stage of reaction, formation of propene is very quick
and the catalyst exhibits high activity. As the surface oxygen
sites are consumed and Ga2O3 is partially reduced, the activity
would decrease quickly. In addition, propene formed from these
pathways is hard to desorb from the surface and may be further
dehydrogenated, leading to fast deactivation of the catalyst. This
conclusion is in good agreement with experimental studies.17
Since it is hard for the surface hydrogen atoms to leave the
surface in the form of water, they must leave mainly in the form
of H2. Formation of H2 requires the formation of GaH species
because the energy barrier to form H2 from GaH-O(2)H pair
or GaH-O(3)H is lower than the barriers of other pathways.
GaH is formed through H abstraction from physically adsorbed
propyl radical or chemically adsorbed propyl (C3H7O(2) or
C3H7Ga) by Ga sites. Thus, as reaction goes on, Ga sites become
the active sites. With the formation of H2 from GaH and surface
hydroxyl groups, Ga, O(2), and O(3) sites are released and the
catalytic cycle is completed.
4.2. Rate-Determining Step. The above discussions indicate
that there is a change of active sites from O(2) sites at the initial
stage of the reaction to Ga sites at the steady stage of the
reaction. Consequently, there is also a change of rate-determin-
ing step. At the initial stage of the reaction, the rate-determining
step is the H abstraction by O(2) site. At the steady stage of the
reaction, the rate-determining step is the H abstraction from
physically or chemically adsorbed propyl intermediates to form
GaH species. The energy barrier for the lowest-energy pathway,
i.e., H abstraction from propyl radical by Ga site, is 19.6 kcal/
mol. For the dehydrogenation of ethane on the gallium-
exchanged zeolite modeled by cluster models, Frash and van
Santen have calculated the rate constants of the three main
reaction steps using transition state theory and found that there
is also a change of rate-determining step from low temperatures
to high temperatures.47 At low temperature (500 K), the third
step, ethane formation with H abstraction by Ga site, is slowest
due to its high activation energy. However, the ﬁrst step, ethyl
formation with H abstraction by O site, appears to be the slowest
at higher temperatures between 700 and 900 K, due to its low
pre-exponential factor, which is a result of a large entropy loss
in the surface activated complex with respect to the gas-phase
ethane molecule. However, our ﬁrst step belongs to a radical
mechanism, not a concerted mechanism. The transition state of
a radical mechanism should have more freedoms than that of a
concerted mechanism. In addition, the reactant of our ﬁrst step
is the physically adsorbed propane molecule, not the gas-phase
propane molecule. Thus, there is little entropy loss from the
physically adsorbed propane to the surface activated complex.
Therefore, the pre-exponential factor of the rate constant of our
ﬁrst step should not be so low that it can lead to a change of
rate-determining step from low temperatures to high tempera-
tures. The change of rate-determining step in the present study
is a result of the change of reaction mechanism from low
temperatures to high temperatures.
4.3. DDH or ODH? The calculation results indicate that
formation of gaseous H2 is easier than the formation of gaseous
H2O. However, formation of surface water is slightly easier than
Figure 9. Energy proﬁles of the low-energy pathways for the dehydrogenation of propane.

Liu et al.
the formation of surface H2, and the formation of hydroxyl
groups is much easier with very low energy barriers. In addition,
formation of gaseous H2O cannot be ruled out at high temper-
atures since the reaction energy to form gaseous H2O is not
signiﬁcantly higher than the energy barrier to form gaseous H2.
Formation of hydroxyl groups, surface water, or gaseous water
all lead to the reduction of the oxide and decrease of the catalytic
activity. Thus, if no oxidant is introduced in the reaction gas
mixture, the dehydrogenation of propane on the Ga2O3(100)
surface would follow an ODH mechanism at the initial stage
of the reaction while completely a DDH mechanism at the steady
stage of the reaction. If oxidant such as CO2 is added, the
dehydrogenation mainly follows a DDH mechanism. The adding
of CO2 has compound multifold effects in the dehydrogenation
of propane: (a) to reoxidize the surface; (b) to remove H2
through a reverse water-gas-shift reaction; and (c) to remove
surface aggregated carbon via the Boudouard reaction.11,12,14,17,19,30
At high temperatures H2O can also desorb from the surface.
This process can be suppressed by increasing the pressure of
gaseous H2O. Experimentally, it was found that for the dehy-
drogenation of ethane the activity of the catalyst decreases
slower if steam is introduced into the reaction system while
the catalyst performs best if both steam and CO2 are intro-
duced.19 Nakagawa et al. suggested that H2O can react with
carbon deposition to improve the stability of the catalyst.19,79
Our calculation indicates that H2O may have compound promot-
ing effects on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
5. Conclusions
To recap, we have presented a comprehensive study of
propane dehydrogenation over various sites on perfect Ga2O3
(100) surface using periodic DFT methods. Our results are as
follows:
(i) Two mechanisms for the initial C-H bond activation of
propane, a concerted mechanism and a stepwise radical mech-
anism, have been explored. The results show that the radical
mechanism is energetically preferred. According to our calcula-
tion, at the initial stage of reaction the O(2) sites on the surface
are the main active sites to activate the ﬁrst C-H bond of
propane due to rather low energy barrier (18.1 kcal/mol) of this
step.
(ii) Propene can be formed by two distinct pathways. One
pathway is H abstraction from physically adsorbed propyl
radical, and the other one is H abstraction from propoxide or
propylgallium intermediates. For both pathways, propene forma-
tion on O(2) sites has lower energy barrier. However, surface
hydroxyl groups formed are rather stable since formation of
either H2 or H2O from them is difﬁcult. In addition, propene
adsorbed on these hydroxyl groups is hard to desorb and is prone
to further dehydrogenation or oligomerization. Thus, once
surface oxygen sites are covered by hydrogen and the surface
is partially reduced, the activity of the catalyst decreases fast.
(iii) Gallium sites are less active than oxygen sites. However,
once surface oxygen sites are consumed, H abstraction from
various propyl intermediates by Ga sites becomes the main
pathway to form propene. This is because, although H abstrac-
tion by Ga has to overcome high energy barriers, the formation
of H2 from GaH and O(2)H or O(3)H hydroxyl group is much
easier than the formation of H2 or H2O from GaH + hydroxyl
group or from hydroxyl groups. Therefore, there is a change of
rate-determining step from H abstraction by oxygen sites at the
initial stage of reaction to H abstraction by Ga sites to form
GaH species.
(iv) Dehydrogenation of propane mainly follows a direct
dehydrogenation (DDH) mechanism. Since at high temperatures
it is also possible to form gaseous H2O, creating oxygen
vacancies on the Ga2O3(100) surface and the reduction of the
catalyst, the activity of the catalyst would decrease without
adding oxidant. Our results show that adding mild oxidant CO2
and steam into the reaction atmosphere has compound promoting
effects on the performance of the Ga2O3 catalyst such as
suppression of the equilibrium to form gaseous H2O, removal
of carbon deposition, reverse water-gas-shift reaction to remove
H2, and reoxidization of surface.
