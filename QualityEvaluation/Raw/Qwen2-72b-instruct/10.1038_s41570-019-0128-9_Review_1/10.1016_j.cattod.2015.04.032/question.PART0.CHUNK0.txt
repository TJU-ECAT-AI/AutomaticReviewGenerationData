Reverse water gas shift a b s  t  r a  c  t In2O3 has  been predicted as an  excellent catalyst  for  CO2 conversion,for both hydrogenation to methanol at low  temperature and reverse water  gas  shift  (RWGS),whereas  CeO2 promotes
RWGS.
In the present work,the  promotion effect of CeO2 on  RWGS over In2O3 was  experimentally investigated.
Characteriza- tions show  that  the surface  areas  of  the  In2O3CeO2 catalysts increase from  that  of pure  In2O3 whereas the size  of the  In2O3 particles in the In2O3CeO2 samples decreases as the fraction of  CeO2 increases.
In addition,the  presence of CeO2 helps to  create  more,  and  stabilizes,oxygen  vacancies,on which  the dissociative hydrogen adsorption is enhanced and  the  amount of bicarbonate species  resulting from acti- vated CO2 adsorption is  increased.
The  synergistic effect between  In2O3 and  CeO2 makes  the In2O3CeO2 catalysts exhibit enhanced activity for  RWGS over  the  pure  In2O3. 2015  Elsevier  B.V.  All  rights reserved.

Introduction CO2 utilization has attracted much attention worldwide nowa- days [1,2].
Several reactions have been exploited for activation and conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals and fuel via vari- ous catalytic processes,including CO2 hydrogenation [3,4],
CO2
reforming [5,6],and oxidation using CO2 as an oxidant [7].
Recently,reverse water gas shift
(RWGS)
has been considered as a promis- ing process for CO2 utilization,which provides feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [811].
Noble metal-based catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts for
RWGS.
Continuous efforts have been made toward improving the catalytic activity and
CO
selectivity [1012].
Based on the previous experimental and the- oretical studies,
RWGS
reaction is believed to proceed through an oxygen exchange step,i.e., CO2 is hydrogenated into formate species on the surface of catalyst and the formate species subse- quently cleave one of the
C
O
bonds to form
CO
[8,12].
Reducible transition oxides can also catalyze hydrogenation of CO2 and oxygen vacancies play a critical role by accommodating oxygen from
C
O
bond cleavage [12].
If these oxides are used as the supporting materials or promoters,they are expected to have Corresponding author at: Tianjin Co-Innovation Center of Chemical Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.

CO2.
Fur- thermore,the use of metal oxides as catalysts has the potential to reduce,and even replace,the noble metals in catalysts for the reaction.
Recently,we studied the adsorption and conversion of CO2 over the Al2O3, SiO2, Ga2O3 and In2O3 based catalysts theoretically and experimentally [4,1316].
Among those catalysts, In2O3 shows the best activity for
RWGS.
The adsorption of CO2 on In2O3 has an adsorption energy of
1.25
eV,which is significantly more favor- able than that on Ga2O3 [15].
The
O
C
O
angel of the adsorbed CO2 is 126and the lengths of two
C
O
bonds are
1.29
A
and
1.28
A
over In2O3.
Those results indicate that the adsorbed CO2 on In2O3 is significantly more distorted from its gas phase structure,and therefore,highly activated.
Moreover,the selectivity of
CO
from
RWGS
over both In2O3 and Ga2O3 is 100% and no CH4 is produced [16].
We  also recently demonstrated that CeO2 has a promotion effect on
RWGS
over a Ga2O3-based catalyst [17].
It has been shown that the presence of CeO2 significantly enhances the generation of bicar- bonate species during CO2 adsorption.
Furthermore,the presence of CeO2 also increases the amount of oxygen vacancies on Ga2O3 so that more hydrogen can be dissociatively adsorbed and,subse- quently,react with the adsorbed
CO2.
In the present work,we aim to further improve and optimize the catalytic activities of In2O3-based catalysts for
RWGS
with CeO2 as a promoter.
Characterizations have been conducted to understand how CeO2 promotes the activation and conversion of CO2 on In2O3. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2015.04.032 0920-5861/ 2015 Elsevier

Experimental
2.1.
Catalyst preparation The pure CeO2 and In2O3 samples were obtained from calcina- tion of cerium nitrate hydrate (99.0%, Kermel, China) and indium nitrate hydrate (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) at
500 C
for 3 h,respectively.
To prepare In2O3CeO2 samples with different CeO2/In2O3 ratios,the co-precipitation method was used.
Firstly,a 10 mL  solution of cerium nitrate and indium nitrate (20 wt% totally) and a 15 mL solu- tion of Na2CO3 (25 wt%) were prepared.
Secondly,the mixed nitrate solution was dropped at a rate of 20 drops/min in the three-necked flask with 50 mL  deionized water while stirring continuously.
At the same time, Na2CO3 solution was dropped into the flask to maintain a constant pH of 7 and solid precipitate was obtained.
The flask was kept in a water bath at
70 C.
When the dropping was com- pleted,the precipitate was aged for 12 h and then washed 5 times to remove residual Na ions before the precipitate being dried at
70 C
for 12 h and further calcined at
500 C
for 3 h.
The In2O3CeO2 samples have In2O3CeO2 weight ratios of
75:25,
50:50,
25:75
and
10:90.
These samples were designated as Samples
AD,
as listed in Table
1.
We  also calculated the molar fractions of CeO2 in the mixed oxide samples and present the results in Table
1.
2.2.
Thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA)
The
TGA
analysis for all samples was carried out under a flow of mixed gas (total flow:25 mL/min,
O2:N2 =
1:4)
at a constant heat- ing rate of 10 C/min in a Netzsch
STA
449
F3
system.
The sample (approximately 10 mg) was loaded into an alumina crucible and heated from room temperature to
1000 C.
2.3.
X-ray diffraction
(XRD)
The
XRD
patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer at a scanning speed of 4/min over the 2 range of
1090. The
diffractometer was equipped with a Ni-filtered Cu
K
radiation source ( =
1.54056
A).
The phase iden- tification was made by comparing the diffraction patterns with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDSs).
2.4.
High resolution transmission electron microscope
(HR-TEM)
HR-TEM
measurements were performed on a Philips Tecnai
G2F20
system operated at 200 kV.
The sample was suspended into ethanol and dispersed ultrasonically for 15 min.
A
drop of the sus- pension was deposited on a copper grid coated with carbon to prepare the sample for
TEM
analysis.
2.5.
Field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM)
The morphology of the sample was characterized using
FESEM
(FEI
Nanosem430).
2.6.
N2 adsorptiondesorption measurements The measurement was carried out with an Autosorb-1 analyzer from Quantachrome Instruments
(AUTOSORB-1-C)
using nitro- gen adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature (77
K).
The sample was degassed in situ at
200 C
for 3 h before nitrogen adsorption measurement.
The multi-point BrumauerEmmettTeller
(BET)
method was employed to calculate the specific surface areas.
The pore size distributions were derived from the isotherms using the
BJH
model.
2.7.
Raman spectra Raman spectra were acquired using a Renishaw inVia reflex spectrometer with a 532 nm wavelength HeNe laser and a full- range grating.
The beam power is 5 mW and the integration time is 10 s.
2.8.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR)
The
FTIR
spectra were recorded using a
BRUKE
Tensor-27 spec- trometer with a resolution of 4 cm1.
During the
FTIR
study,the sample was held in an
IR
cell with CaF2 windows.
The sample was heated in flowing Ar (20 mL/min) over the temperature range from room temperature to
300 C
at a heating rate of 10 C/min.
The sample was held at
300 C
for 1 h and then cooled down to
50 C
before the flowing gas was switched to CO2 and
H2 (20
mL/min,
CO2:H2 =
1:1)
from Ar for 30 min,and back to Ar (20 mL/min) for 30 min.
The entire process was performed under the atmospheric pressure.
2.9.
Catalytic activity test
RWGS
was conducted under atmospheric pressure in a quartz- tube fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 4 mm).
A
catalyst sample of 50 mg was packed into the quartz tube.
The reaction started in a gaseous mixture of Ar, CO2 and H2 with a volume ratio of
2:1:1
(total flow rate = 40 mL/min) over a temperature range of
250500 C.
The effluent was analyzed online by a gas chromatograph (Agilent
6890D)
equipped with a
TDX01
column and a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD).

Results and discussion
3.1.
Catalytic activity Fig. 1 shows the conversions of CO2 and H2 over the pure In2O3,the mixed In2O3CeO2 samples
AD
and the pure CeO2 for
RWGS.
Obviously,the conversion of CO2 and H2 on all samples increases with increasing temperature.
Among these samples,pure CeO2 exhibits no activity until
450 C.
In contrast,there is a significant conversion at the temperature as low as
300 C
on pure In2O3.
These results are consistent with our previous work [16].
As shown in Fig. 1,conversions of CO2 and H2 on Samples

and
B

For example,the conversions of CO2 on pure In2O3 are
0.38%,
4.14%
and
16.18%
at 300,400 and
500 C,
respectively,and those of CO2 on Sample
B
are
0.39%,
5.34%
and
19.98%,
respectively.
These results indicate that CeO2 has a promotion effect on
RWGS
over In2O3,similar to that over Ga2O3 [17].
On the other hand,even though Sample
B
has the highest catalytic activity,the activities of Samples
C
and
D
are lower than that of the pure In2O3,suggesting that the promo- tion effect of CeO2 is dependent on the fraction of CeO2 in In2O3.
Also shown in Fig. 1,the conversions of CO2 and H2 are almost the same on all the catalyst samples.
Furthermore,there are no
CH4
or other products detected in the effluent according to the spectra of gas chromatograph.
Clearly,these catalysts selectively catalyze
CO
formation through
RWGS.
To understand the promotion effect of CeO2 on In2O3,we characterized the catalyst samples and will discuss the results below.
3.2.
TGA
and
XRD
characterization The calcination temperatures of pure In2O3,pure CeO2 and Samples
A
to
D
are determined by the
TGA
analysis,as shown in Fig. 2a and b.
From the
TGA
results,we can conclude that the salts are completely decomposed at
500 C.
We  would point out that the In2O3CeO2 samples show a different weight-loss ratio from the pure oxides,i.e.,the weight loss in the mixed oxide samples is significantly smaller than that of the single oxide samples.
This is because the single oxide samples are obtained from direct decomposition of nitrate hydrates whereas the mixed In2O3CeO2 samples are obtained from the calcination of the car- bonates obtained from the co-precipitation processes.
The
XRD
patterns of the catalyst samples are presented in Fig.
3.
For pure In2O3,peaks appear at 2 =
30.514,
35.379,
50.899and
60.516,
which are assigned to the diffractions from the (2 2 0),(4 0 0),(4 4 0) and (6 2 2) planes,according to
PDF#65-3170.
For pure CeO2,peaks are observed at 2 =
28.554,
33.081,
47.478
and
56.334,
which are assigned to the (1 1 1),(2 0 0),(2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes,according to
PDF#34-0394.
As shown in the diffrac- tion patterns,the peaks of pure In2O3 are much sharper than those of pure CeO2,suggesting that the crystallinity of pure In2O3 is much better.
For the mixed In2O3CeO2 samples,the peaks of both In2O3 and CeO2 are observed,while no peaks of CeIn alloys can be found,indicating the catalysts are in the form of mixed metal oxides.
In the mixed oxide samples,the peak intensity of In2O3 is much weaker than that of CeO2.
For example,almost no In2O3 features are iden- tifiable in the
XRD
patterns of Sample
C.
Even in Sample
A,
the In2O3 features are not dominant.
This suggests that the In2O3 par- ticles are dispersed well on the CeO2 particles and the size of In2O3 particles is much smaller.
The particle sizes of In2O3 and CeO2 are calculated according to the Scherrer equations and the results are shown in Table
1.
As shown in Table 1,the diameter of the In2O3 particles decreases from 28 nm to 13 nm after adding CeO2.

HR-TEM
images of all samples. other hand,the size of the CeO2 particles increases slightly and no evident changes exist in the characteristic peaks as its content decreases,which is contrary to that of In2O3.
These results indicate that the change of the In2O3 particle morphology is much greater than that of CeO2. Therefore,we speculate that CeO2 acts as a sup- port,on which small In2O3 particles are dispersed.
This function of CeO2 has been reported in other works [12,18].
Selected samples of the used catalysts have also been charac- terized and the results are provided in the Supporting Information.
From Fig.
S1
in the supporting information,the peaks of both CeO2 and In2O3 are observed,while no peaks assigned to Ce metal, In metal or CeIn alloy can be found,indicating the catalysts remain in the form of metal oxides after being used.
The intensities of the In2O3 peaks show some changes,which can be attributed to changes in the phase structure of In2O3 particles after the reaction.
We note,however,the principal exposing faces of In2O3 have no significant changes based on the
TEM
analyses,as shown in Fig.
S2.
These results indicate that the active sites of the catalysts are quite stable.
3.3.
HR-TEM
and
SEM
images In order to understand the morphological and the structural changes of the two oxides in the mixed catalyst samples,we per- formed
HR-TEM
and
SEM
analyses.
Fig. 4 shows

images of all the catalyst samples.
In Fig. 4,clear lattice fringes of In2O3 and CeO2 are observed while no lattice fringe of CeIn alloy can Fig.

images of all samples. be found,suggesting that the catalyst exists in the form of metal oxide particles.
In addition,comparing the figures of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2,the lattice fringes of pure In2O3 are much clearer than those of pure CeO2,indicating that the crystallinity of In2O3 is much better than that of CeO2. This observation is consistent with the conclusion based on the
XRD
results.
For the In2O3CeO2 samples,more lattice fringes of In2O3 than CeO2 are found as the content of In2O3 increases.
In particular,almost no lattice fringes of CeO2 are observable on Samples
A
and
B.
The results again sup- port that the crystallinity of In2O3 is better than that of CeO2 even though the particle sizes of In2O3 are smaller than those of CeO2.
SEM
images of all samples are shown in Fig.
5.
As shown in Fig. 5,the morphology and structure of pure In2O3 are very different from that of pure CeO2.
For pure In2O3,clear spherical particles of In2O3 could be found due to their large size and good crystallinity.
In con- trast,no clear morphology of CeO2 particles can be identified due to the small particle sizes.
Among the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples,spherical In2O3 particles can be identified on the surface of CeO2 in Samples
A
and
B,
but the size is much smaller than those found in pure In2O3.
Whereas the morphologies of Samples
C
and
D
are similar to that of pure CeO2 since the content of CeO2 is high.
These results are in agreement with the
XRD
patterns.
Moreover,the
TEM
and
SEM
images of the used catalysts (Sam- ples
A
and
B)
in Figs.
S2
and
S3
show clearly that the lattice fringes and morphology after
RWGS
are almost the same as those before the reactions.
The results suggest that the catalysts have good sta- bility under the reaction conditions.

2.
As shown in Fig. 6,all isotherms are of type
IV,
which is a characteristic of mesoporous materials [19,20].
From Table 2,we find that the textural properties of pure In2O3 and pure CeO2 are very different.
The pure In2O3 has the biggest size in mesopore range and the smallest surface area.
On the con- trary,pure CeO2 has the almost smallest size in mesopore range and the biggest surface area.
For In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples,surface areas show a significant increase as compared with pure In2O3.
The mesopore size and volume of these samples are almost the same as those of pure CeO2 but the surface area changes evidently.
This can be attributed to the fact that the In2O3 particles in the mixed oxide samples have a similar size and disperse well on the surface of the CeO2 particles,consistent with the
SEM
images.
These results demonstrate that the CeO2 particles act as support to the In2O3 particles,and thereby increase the surface area of the catalysts.
3.5.
FTIR
and Raman spectra In order to investigate how CeO2 promotes the catalytic activ- ities of In2O3,
FTIR
and Raman analyses were performed to characterize the oxide particles and their chemisorption proper- ties.
The
FTIR
spectra of all the catalyst samples are shown in Fig.
7.
For pure In2O3,the bands at 1639,1558,1413,1328 and 1248 cm1 appear.
The bands at 1639 and 1558 cm1 are assigned to the asymmetrical stretching of
OCO,
whereas the bands at 1413,1328 and 1248 cm1 are assigned to the symmetrical stretching of
OCO.
These bands are attributed to the adsorbed CO2 in the form of bidentate carbonates with different adsorption configurations [15].
After desorption for 30 min,these absorption bands disap- pear,suggesting the adsorption of CO2 on In2O3 are relatively weak.

On pure CeO2,absorption bands appear at 1625,1407,1379,1269,1215 and 1031 cm1.
These bands are attributed to hydrogeno- carbonate (1625,1379 and 1031 cm1),inorganic carboxylate ions (1407 cm1) [21] and bidentate carbonate (1269 and 1215 cm1) [22].
In contrast to pure In2O3,the adsorption bands of pure CeO2 remain after desorption for 30 min,indicating that the adsorption of CO2 on CeO2 is strong.
On the other hand,the
FTIR
spectra for
CO2
on the mixed In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples show some differences.
At high CeO2 content such as in Samples
C
and
D,
the
FTIR
spectra are similar to that on pure CeO2 and absorption bands are strong.
In addition,absorption bands on Samples
A
and
B
are weaker than that on pure In2O3,with Sample
A
being the lowest.
The fact that the reaction rates of
RWGS
over Samples
A
and
B
are faster than that over pure In2O3 can be attributed to that the added CeO2 makes the amount of the adsorbed formate species smaller.
To confirm this speculation,we performed a Raman analysis of all the catalyst samples.
The Raman scattering spectra for all the catalyst samples are pre- sented in Fig.
8.
The characteristic peak of pure CeO2 at 457 cm1 is clearly observed in Fig.
8.
The peak is attributed to the strong F2g mode of the CeO2 fluorite phase.
In the mixed In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples,a red shift and decrease of bandwidth of the F2g mode are observed as the content of CeO2 decreases.
The decrease of band- width indicates the creation of oxygen vacancies and the growth of particle size [23],while the red shift is most likely due to the lattice expansion and mode softening that occurs when oxygen vacancies are created [24].
The amount of oxygen deficit
due to the oxygen vacancies can be calculated by the function:
=
2.66
(ω/),where ω is the Raman shift [24].
The calculated
values for Samples
AD
are
11.64
× 103,
23.28
× 103,
11.64
× 103 and
5.82
× 103,respectively.
Among these catalyst samples,the oxy- gen deficiency of Sample
B
is the largest.
In addition,characteristic peaks of pure In2O3 are also observable at 131 cm1 and 306 cm1.
The peak appears at 131 cm1 is assigned to the In
O
vibration of InO6 structural units [25],while the peak at 306 cm1 is attributed to the bending vibration of InO6 octahedrons,i.e.,(InO6) [26].
For In2O3CeO2 samples,peaks exhibit a blue shift as the content of In2O3 decreases,indicating a size effect of In2O3 nanostructures on their Raman properties due to the reduced size of In2O3 particles [27].

shows the Raman spectra of the used catalysts (Samples

The characteristic peak of pure CeO2 at 457 cm1 is still clearly observable with almost no shift after the reaction.
In addi- tion,the characteristic peaks of In2O3 at 131 cm1 and 306 cm1 are also observable.
We  note,however,there is a small red shift for the peaks at 131 cm1.
This could be attributed to the changes in the phase structures,as we discussed in the
XRD
analyses.
Theoretical work [28] has confirmed that,when bonded at the cerium site,the most stable configuration of
H2O
on the CeO2 surface presents,which involves two
O
H
bonds of hydro- gen and oxygen atoms at the surface.
If the amount of oxygen vacancies is larger at the surface,there will be an effectively attrac- tive interaction between water molecules and oxygen vacancies.
This speculation has been proved by
FTIR
spectra.
The dissocia- tive adsorption of
H2O
is facile on the defective surface,in direct contrast to
H2O
preferring a molecularly adsorbed state on the dry perfect surface.
It can be concluded that the presence of oxygen vacancies introduced by CeO2 on the surface promotes the Fig.

The wavelength of HeNe laser is 532 nm,the beam power is 5 mW and the integration time is 10 s. dissociation of
H2O,
and generates more hydroxyl groups.
There- fore, CO2 more favorably reacts with the surface hydroxyl groups on the In2O3CeO2 samples than on pure In2O3,which facili- tates subsequent conversion reactions.
Our previous work has also demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy on the In2O3 surface assists CO2 activation and hydrogenation [29].
On the basis of catalyst characterizations above,there are sev- eral explanations to the promotion effect of CeO2 on
RWGS
over In2O3 for CeO2 acting as the catalyst support:(1) increases the surface area from the pure In2O3 and provides more adsorption sites for
CO2;
(2) reduces the size of the In2O3 particles so that the sizes of two metal oxide particles are almost the same and In2O3 particles can disperse well on the surface of CeO2;(3) creates more oxygen vacancies.
The relationship between the activities of catalysts and the most significant impact is shown in Fig.

On pure In2O3, Samples
A
and
B,
the extra oxygen vacancies produced dominate the activity of the catalyst.
As the amount of reactive sites is sufficient in these samples,higher content of CeO2 would result in more oxygen vacancies.
Therefore,both adsorption and Fig.

The catalytic activities of these catalyst samples show an order of pure In2O3 < Sample
A
< Sample
B.
On the other hand,for pure CeO2, Samples
BD,
the amount of reactive sites determines the activity of the catalyst.
As the amount of oxygen vacancies is sufficient in these samples,a higher In2O3 content is expected to result in more active sites for the adsorbed CO2 to react.
So,the catalytic activities of these samples follow an order of the pure CeO2 < Sample

< Sample

< Sample

Combining the contribu- tions from both oxygen vacancy and active site creation as a result of adding CeO2 to In2O3, Sample

Conclusions In summary,we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of In2O3 on
RWGS
is enhanced by mixing with CeO2 as a promoter while the selectivity toward
CO
is maintained at 100%.
The presence of CeO2 increases the surface areas of the In2O3CeO2 catalysts over the pure In2O3.
In addition,the In2O3 particles in the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples also show smaller size and better dispersion.
The most important issue is that more oxygen vacancies are created in the presence of CeO2 so that more hydrogen can be dissociatively adsorbed.
Furthermore,the generation of bicarbonate species dur- ing the CO2 adsorption is also significantly enhanced.
Therefore,the In2O3CeO2 catalyst samples show an increased activity for
RWGS.
