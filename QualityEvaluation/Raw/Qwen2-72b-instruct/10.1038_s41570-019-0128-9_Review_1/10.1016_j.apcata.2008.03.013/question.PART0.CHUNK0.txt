1. Introduction
The capacity to store and release oxygen is one of the particular properties of ceria that makes this material exceptionally effective in several catalytic applications. As an example, CeO2-based oxides are always incorporated to three-way catalyst (TWC) formulations.
It has been suggested that ceria promotes noble metal dispersion,increases the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support, promotes the water gas shift (WGS) and steam reforming reactions, favours catalytic activity at the interfacial noble metalsupport sites,promotes CO removal through oxidation employing lattice oxygen,and stores and releases oxygen under lean and rich conditions,respectively [1]. Ceria was also found to have an important dry reforming activity (CH4 + CO2) for the H2 and CO production under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) conditions. Ceria has been proposed as a candidate catalyst for dry reforming since it is more resistant towards carbon deposition compared to Ni based catalysts [2]. The effect of CeO2 on the catalytic behaviour of the supported Pt catalysts in the reaction of the CO2 reforming of CH4 has been also studied, concluding that the addition of ceria results in an improvement of the catalytic performance due to the increase in the metalsupport interface area [3].
Furthermore, it has been also reported that oxygen released from CeO2 as a consequence of oxygen exchange with gas-phase O2 plays an important role in catalysed soot oxidation [4], which has opened a new route for the development of soot oxidation catalysts based on an active oxygen species for the particulate emission control in Diesel engines. Recent results demonstrate that CeO2 doping, e.g. with La3+, leads to improved mixed oxides and a synergetic effects of Pt and La3+ have been observed in CeLa mixed oxide-supported Pt [5].
It is ambitious to define the role of CeO2 in the different catalytic applications mentioned, since the multiple effects have been attributed to this compound, but there is a common point that is related to the ability of noble metal/CeO2 systems to promote the migration/exchange of the oxygen species. This has motivated the study of the oxygen dynamic interactions in the different CeO2- based materials and labelled gasses are extremely useful for such investigations.
Most of the studies performed with gas molecules containing isotopic oxygen have been carried out with 18O2. For instance, Madier et al. [6] studied the mobility of oxygen within CeO2 and CexZr(1x)O2 lattices by using 18O2. Holmgren and Andersson [7,8] used 18O2 to compare the oxygen exchange in Pt/CeO2, Pt/CeO2/ Al2O3, and Pt/Al2O3. On a pure ceria, both simple and multiple exchange mechanisms are reported to occur above 300 8C [5,9].
There are two reaction paths taking place: (i) both 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule are exchanged yielding 16O2 or (ii) only one of the 18O atoms of the 18O2 molecule is exchanged yielding 16O18O.
In a few cases the interaction of CeO2-based materials with molecules containing isotopic oxygen different to 18O2 has been studied in detail. For example, Cunningham et al. [10] reported the exchange of oxygen between 15N18O and CeO2, occurring from about 175 8C. Holmgren et al. [11] also reported the evidence of the oxygen exchange between CO2 and CeO2 following an elegant Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149

The oxygen exchange mechanism between C18O2 and CeO2 and the role of Pt in this process have been studied in an advanced TAP reactor in the 200600 8C temperature range. For bare and Pt-containing CeO2, the exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 takes place in the whole temperatures range studied,and the oxygen exchange rate increases with temperature. The proposed mechanistic pathway consists of the exchange of the oxygen atoms in the C18O2 molecule in two consecutive steps. In the case of bare CeO2, only one of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 is exchanged between 200 and 300 8C, and temperatures above 300 8C are required for the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. Pt accelerates the exchange rate between 200 and 400 8C, mainly favouring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule. The effect of Pt cannot be resolved at higher temperature (above 400 8C), since at high temperature the direct exchange over bare CeO2 is already fast. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.apcata.2008.03.013 experimental procedure despite the oxygen exchange mechanism was not described. In the mentioned study [11], CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples were reduced in a H2 gas flow at 400 8C and reoxidised afterwards with 18O2 and, thereby, 18O-containing CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 samples were obtained. Then, C16O2 was fed at 400 8C to the samples and the change in the gas composition with time was monitored by a mass spectrometer detecting the rapid formation of C16O18O on both CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 samples and very small amounts of C18O2. In the same line, Demoulin et al. [12] have recently investigated the oxidising role of CO2 at mild temperature on ceria-based catalysts. It was concluded that it is possible to dissociatively activate CO2 on a pre-reduced cerium oxide-based catalysts at 300 8C.
Isotopic C18O2 was used by Efstathiou et al. [13] to demonstrate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 molecule and yttria- stabilised zirconia at 650 8C, in a study focussed on the reforming of methane with carbon dioxide into synthesis gas over supported rhodium catalysts.
The aim of this study is to investigate the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and the CeO2 in more detail and to analyse the role of Pt during this exchange process. For this purpose, C18O2 has been used and the exchange mechanism has been studied in an advanced TAP (Temporal Analysis of Products) reactor. The exchange pathway is investigated between 200 and 600 8C temperature range, analysing whether the single and/or double oxygen exchange of CO2 takes place.
2. Experimental
For the preparation of CeO2, Ce(NO3)36H2O (Aldrich, 99%) was calcined in air at 1000 8C for 90 min (heating rate 10 8C/min). For the preparation of Pt-containing CeO2 (Pt/CeO2), 1 g of CeO2 was impregnated with 2 ml of a 0.013 M aqueous [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution (Pt precursor from Aldrich, 99.995%). The obtained mixture was dried at 100 8C, followed by platinum precursor decomposition at 500 8C in air for 5 h (heating rate 1 8C/min). The target Pt loading is 0.5 wt.% and the Pt particle size is 36 nm (Fig. 1), as it was observed by the TEM characterization performed in a JOEL (JEM-2010) microscope.
Characterization details of these samples were reported else- where [5]. In brief, typical fluorite structure of CeO2 was detected by Raman and XRD. The crystal size of CeO2 determined by the Scherrers equation is 78 nm and its BET surface area is 2 m2/g.
A TAP reactor, the so-called Multitrack, has been used to analyse the interaction between gas-phase C18O2 and the samples CeO2 and Pt/CeO2. A detailed description of the Multitrack apparatus is available elsewhere [14,15]. A cylindrical reactor with 7 mm internal diameter containing the sample was connected to an ultra-high vacuum system (106 Pa). Small gas pulses, typically consisting of 1016 molecules of almost pure C18O2 (100% 12C and 97% 18O), were fed to the sample using high-speed gas pulsing valves. The reactor is coupled to three mass spectrometers that measure the components of the gas leaving the reactor with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz. In separate experiments Ar gas was pulsed through the bed of sample at different temperatures to obtain inert gas reference profiles. The experiments were carried out with 100 mg of sample (around 1020 molecules of CeO2;around 1017 surface oxygen atoms) and this number of molecules was much higher than the amount of gas molecules pulsed. At least 104 pulses would be necessary to reach similar molecular amounts of C18O2 and CeO2 and about 10 pulses to reach the amount of surface oxygen.
The protocol of the experiments consisted of initially the stabilisation of the temperature at 200 8C in vacuum. Then, Ar was pulsed to obtain reference interactions of inert gas with catalyst and followed by C18O2 pulsing to study oxygen interactions with the catalyst samples. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 300, 400, 500, and 600 8C and Ar and C18O2 were pulsed at each temperature, as described above.
3. Results
A TAP reactor is a powerful tool that can provide both qualitative and quantitative information about the process studied. On one hand, the comparison between the shape of the Ar and CO2 MS profiles provides information about the rate of the oxygen exchange between C18O2 and the samples studied, since it is assumed that there is no chemical interaction between samples and Ar (as seen from the similar shapes of Ar profiles). On the other hand, the integration of the area of the different CO2 profiles,including C18O2, C16O18O, and C16O2, allow evaluating the extent of the oxygen exchange between the C18O2 and the samples at each temperature. In this study, both qualitative and quantitative approaches have been followed and are discussed.
One of the interesting properties of a TAP reactor is that working under very low pressures, the effect of the diffusion phenomena is minimised. However, the extrapolation of the conclusions reached under high vacuum conditions to normal pressure should be done taking this into account. It is expected that high pressure will accelerate the oxygen exchange processes, but diffusion steps will become more dominant.
3.1. Qualitative analysis: shape of the MS profiles
As an example, the different signals measured after pulses of C18O2 (C18O18O) at 600 8C over the samples are included in Fig. 2.
The signals have been normalised to have the same total area of the sum of all the peaks corresponding to a pulse. This would not be necessary since differences between these total areas are lower than 10%, but this normalisation facilitated comparison between the different pulses.
In the experiments included in Fig. 2, and also in those performed at lower temperatures (figures not shown), C18O2 (mass 48) and/or C16O18O (mass 46) and/or C16O2 (mass 44) are detected,indicating oxygen exchange between C18O2 and CeO2. All the CO2 profiles included in Fig. 2, regardless they carry 16O and/or 18O,present the same features as those of Ar, that is, a sharp raise of the response after 0.1 s and a long tail afterwards.

pez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149 145 From the different CO2 profiles, the CO2 total profiles have been calculated as the sum of signals:
CO2
total  C16O18O  C16O2  C18O2 The differences between the shapes of the CO2 total profiles and the corresponding Ar profiles are shown in Fig. 2. Both in Fig. 2a and b, the CO2 total profiles lag behind the Ar response curve because the oxygen exchange process occurring with C18O2 takes longer than the simple diffusion of inert Ar throughout the solid bed. Note that the differences between the shapes of Ar pulses observed between Fig. 2a and b (Ar peak in Fig. 2a is narrower than that in Fig. 2b) have to be attributed to small differences in the samples bed package. Ar profiles corresponding to a certain sample are only a valid reference for this particular sample, and comparison between CO2 or Ar peaks of different samples is not possible. This comment is only valid for the shape of peaks but not to the area of peaks, since the amount of gas pulsed is constant.
The effect of the temperature on the MS profiles has been evaluated and an example of the Ar profiles obtained at different temperatures for the Pt/CeO2 sample is shown in Fig. 3. All Ar profiles are similar, indicating that under the reaction conditions used, temperatures have insignificant effect on the Ar diffusion through the sample bed. Similar Ar profiles were observed for CeO2 (not shown). On the contrary, the temperature affects the exchange of oxygen between the C18O2 and the samples, as it is observed in Fig. 4. The exchange of the oxygen of C18O2 with CeO2 (Fig. 4a) increases as the temperature raises and the CO2 total profile becomes sharper as the temperature is increased from 200 to 600 8C. This indicates that the rate of exchange is increasing with increasing temperature. Comparison between Fig. 4a and b points out that the temperature has a more accelerating effect on CeO2 (Fig. 4a) than on Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 4b), since all the CO2 total profiles in Fig. 4b are quite similar, and only a minor trend is observed in their shape from 200 to 600 8C. For a certain temperature the Ar and
CO2
total profiles corresponding to Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 4b) are closer to each other than the counterpart profiles obtained with CeO2 (Fig. 4a). In other words, there is a shorter delay between CO2 total and Ar profiles in Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 4b) than that in CeO2 (Fig. 4a),indicating that Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange process, and this accelerating effect of Pt is clearly evident at low temperatures.
It is reasonable to assume that Pt activates CO2 favouring the CO bond breaking at the Pt/CeO2 interface and, therefore, the oxygen exchange processes take place faster in the presence of Pt than in bare CeO2.
One important experimental observation is that the gas profiles do not change with time and the same results are obtained for all the C18O2 pulses performed at each temperature (around 10). This Fig. 2. MS traces of C18O2 pulse interactions at 600 8C over (a) CeO2 and (b) Pt/CeO2.

A. Bueno-Lo
pez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149 146 suggests that the formation of stable carbonates does not take place to a great extent under the experimental conditions used for the TAP studies. If carbonates were formed then the C18O2 consumption would be expected and the earlier pulses should be missed or the area should be smaller, but this is clearly not the case.
The reactivity and stability of the carbonate species on a Pt/CeO2 catalyst was studied by Hilaire et al. [16] by diffuse reflectance FT- IR (DRIFT), and they noted that carbonates were stable on the reduced ceria but were easily decomposed by re-oxidation in either O2 or H2O. The reactivity and stability of the carbonate species formed at the surface of a Pt/CeO2 catalyst was also investigated by Meunier et al. [17] and they reported that the surface of the fresh and oxidised sample exhibited a significant concentration of carbonates, like most oxide materials presenting some basic character. In the mentioned study, the stability of these carbonates was analysed, concluding that carbonates were stable under Ar but they were readily exchanged when they will contact with 13CO2. We can now state that the whole CO2 molecule is not exchanged in a single step, but the mechanism is much more com- plex involving the exchange of oxygen between the CO2 and CeO2.
As a summary of this qualitative study, it can be concluded that the oxygen exchange rate between C18O2 and CeO2 becomes faster by increasing the temperature from 200 to 600 8C, and also by loading cerium oxide with Pt. The effect of Pt is more important at low temperature than that at high temperature, since at high temperature the exchange process is already fast in bare CeO2.
3.2. Quantitative analysis: area of the MS profiles
From profiles as those shown in Fig. 2a and b, the C18O2 conversion and products selectivity after the pulses of C18O2 has been quantified and plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of temperature.
The C18O2 conversion has been calculated with the equation: C18O2 conversion  100  Area COtotal 2 Area C18O2 Area COtotal 2 where Area C18O2 is the area under the C18O2 peak and Area
CO2
total is the sum of areas under the C18O2 + C16O2 + C16O18O signals. This can be done since the carbon balance is fulfilled at every temperature and there is not CO2 accumulation on the sample. As discussed in the previous section, this is deduced from the following facts: the area under the CO2 total peaks is constant for all the temperatures studied, it does not change for different pulses performed at a certain temperature, and it is the same area than that obtained for Ar pulses (always assuming 10% error because of experimental handling, as mentioned).The selectivity for each CO2 species (generically denoted product selectivity) is calculated dividing the area under the peak of the CO2 species considered between the areas under the CO2 total peak.
Regardless of the temperature, part or all the C18O2 pulsed over CeO2 (Fig. 5a) is consumed. The C18O2 conversion increases with the temperature from about 25% at 200 8C to 100% above 500 8C.
The interaction of C18O2 with CeO2 yields both C18O16O and C16O2.
C18O16O is the major product at 200 to 400 8C, whose percentage in the exit gases increases as the C18O2 consumption increases. At 400 8C C16O2 is also formed and, above this temperate, C16O2 becomes the major product. This indicates that oxygen exchange between C18O2 and CeO2 occurs in sequential steps. At low temperatures (from 200 to 400 8C), only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged, and temperature above 400 8C is required to exchange the second oxygen atom of C18O2. At 500 8C and higher temperature, both atoms of oxygen of the C18O2 molecule are exchanged and C16O2 is the main product with minor formation of C18O16O molecules.
The described oxygen exchange path is different when Pt is deposited on CeO2 (Fig. 5b). Between 200 and 400 8C, oxygen exchange between C18O2 and Pt/CeO2 occurs in a higher extent than that over CeO2 (Fig. 5a), the conversion of C18O2 being 55% and 85% at 200 and 400 8C, respectively, but above 400 8C, the benefit of Pt disappears. This suggests that, above 400 8C, CO2 is mainly adsorbed and exchanged directly on ceria even in the presence of Pt. This is consistent with the experimental results of Holmgren et al. [11], who observed (at 400 8C) that the exchange rates of the oxygen atoms of CO2 are about equal on ceria and Pt/ceria. One can now state that this is valid above a certain temperature (400 8C in our experimental conditions), but at lower temperatures Pt plays an important role. One additional feature of the Pt is that it improves the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule at low temperatures, as C16O2 is observed even at 200 and 300 8C in Fig. 5b, but not in Fig. 5a.
Considering these results, the role of Pt seems to be different depending on the reaction temperature. If the temperature is low (200400 8C), Pt accelerates significantly the exchange of the oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule and this mainly affects the exchange of the second atom of oxygen. If the temperature is high (500600 8C), the oxygen exchange rate between C18O2 and bare CeO2 is already fast and the effect of Pt is not as obvious as in the lower temperatures range.
4. Discussion: proposed mechanisms
From these experiments, the following oxygen exchange mechanisms between C18O2 and bare/Pt-containing CeO2 are proposed: Fig. 5. C18O2 conversion and products selectivity after C18O2 pulses at different temperatures over (a) CeO2 and (b) Pt/CeO2.

4.1. CeO2 sample
In the case of bare CeO2, the exchange of oxygen with C18O2 could occur in a single step (reaction (1)) or a sequence of two consecutive steps (reactions (2) and (3)), and the contribution of each reaction depends on temperature: Exchange of both oxygen atoms at once:nCe16O2  C18O2 ! n  1Ce16O2Ce18O2  C16O2 (1) Exchange of the oxygen atoms consecutively:nCe16O2  C18O2 ! n  1=2Ce16O2Ce16O18O  C16O18O (2) n  1=2Ce16O2Ce16O18O  C16O18O ! n  1Ce16O2Ce18O2  C16O2 (3) Between 200 and 300 8C, only one oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule is exchanged and the only reaction taking place is reaction (2). Some authors have suggested [12] that in the presence of a reducing gas the activation of the CO2 molecule takes place on oxygen vacant sites adjacent to Ce3+ sites. Binet et al. [18] have reported that reduced surface defects can be created on ceria by simply heating in vacuum at temperatures as low as 200 8C. These are the conditions of the TAP reactor and, therefore, the presence of a little fraction of reduced sites can be explained. Therefore, in our case we could assume the presence of a small fraction of vacant sites on CeO2 associated to Ce3+ positions, where the reaction (2) could take place despite most of cerium cations are expected to be in the 4+ oxidation state. The H2-consumption profile obtained in a temperature programmed reduction experiment (which was previously reported elsewhere [5]) showed that the CeO2 used is only reduced by H2 above 600 8C, supporting that this sample is hardly reduced at low temperature.
Above 300 8C, C16O2 is formed, but reaction (2) still occurs.C16O18O is detected in the whole range of temperatures studied (up to 600 8C), and this demonstrates that the exchange of the two oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule takes place consecutively throughout reactions (2) and (3). This sequence of reactions is described in Scheme 1. The exchange of the second atom of the CO2 molecule could occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with the C18O16O-like surface species. In the former pathway, a scramble molecule that has been desorbed after the first oxygen exchange,and is already in the gas-phase, would be adsorbed again on CeO2 and would exchange the remaining 18O atom. In the latter, C18O16O-like molecules formed after the exchange of the first oxygen atom which are still attached to the solid surface could exchange their second oxygen atom and then release as C16O2. In both cases, C16O2 is formed.
4.2. Pt/CeO2 sample
In the case of Pt-deposited CeO2, the participation of the noble metal in the oxygen exchange processes depends on temperature.
At high temperature (500 and 600 8C), the effect of Pt is not obvious by comparison of the CeO2 (Fig. 5a) and Pt/CeO2 (Fig. 5b) behaviour. It is reasonable to assume that, in this range of temperatures where the oxygen exchange rate between C18O2 and CeO2 is fast, the reactions (2) and (3) take place. On the contrary, at lower temperatures (200400 8C) the behaviour of CeO2 and Pt/ CeO2 is quite different. Between 200 and 400 8C, Pt accelerates the oxygen exchange rate. In this case, the exchange of both oxygen atoms of C18O2 at once (reactions (4) and (5)) and/or the exchange of both oxygen atoms of C18O2 consecutively (reactions (4), (6), (7) and (8)) could be also considered.
Exchange of both oxygen atoms at once: Pt  C18O2 ! PtC18O2 (4) PtC18O2  nCe16O2 ! Pt  n  1Ce16O2Ce18O2  C16O2 (5) Exchange of the oxygen atoms consecutively: Reaction (4) followed by PtC18O2  nCe16O2 ! Pt  n  1=2Ce16O2Ce16O18O  C16O18O (6) Pt  C16O18O ! PtC16O18O (7) PtC16O18O  n  1=2Ce16O2Ce16O18O ! Pt  n  1Ce16O2Ce18O2  C16O2 (8) Taking into account that C16O18O is detected in the whole range of temperatures studied, as in the case of bare CeO2, it can be concluded that the exchange of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 consecutively is preferred to the exchange both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule at once. The preferred mechanism, described by reactions (4), (6), (7) and (8), is drawn in Scheme 2. In the presence of Pt, as discussed for bare CeO2, the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2 could also occur with C18O16O in the gas-phase or with C18O16O-like surface species, and both reaction pathways would yield finally C16O2.

A. Bueno-Lo
pez et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 342 (2008) 144149 148 The adsorption of C18O2 on Pt and the exchange of the first oxygen atom of C18O2 with Ce16O2 (reactions (4) and (6)) could occurs by two mechanisms: (i) a C18O bond of Ce18O2 is completely broken on Pt with Pt18O formation, 18O diffuses from Pt18O to a Ce16O2 vacant site and 16O diffuses back or (ii) the C18O bond is broken at the PtCe16O2 interface and the exchange of oxygen occurs at this interface. The later option is the most provable at low temperature, since the PtO bond requires a certain temperature to be broken spontaneously in the absence of any reducing gas. Most provably, once 18O is incorporated to Ce16O2 at the interface, there will be a further rearrangement of oxygen atoms and vacant sites. This is supported by the fact that the amount of surface 16O atoms available on the samples (1017) is of the same magnitude order than the amount of 18O pulsed (10 pulses of 1017 C18O2 molecules per temperature). Thus, this rearrangement is necessary to keep the interface Pt/CeO2 available for further reactions.
5. Conclusions
The TAP experiments performed with CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 using labelled CO2 leads to conclude that: There is an exchange of oxygen between the C18O2 molecules and cerium oxide between 200 and 600 8C, and the exchange rate and mechanism depends significantly on temperature. In both samples, the exchange rate becomes faster by increasing the temperature.
The exchange of the oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule mainly occurs in two consecutive steps and this is valid both for CeO2 and Pt/CeO2. This reaction pathway is preferred to the exchange of both oxygen atoms of the C18O2 molecule at once.
In the case of bare CeO2, only one of the oxygen atoms of C18O2 is exchanged between 200 and 300 8C, and temperatures above 300 8C are required for the exchange of the second oxygen atom of C18O2. Above 400 8C, the double-exchanged CO2 (C16O2) is the main product.
Pt accelerates the exchange rate of oxygen from C18O2 in the low range of temperatures (200400 8C), mainly favouring the exchange of the second oxygen atom of the C18O2 molecule.The effect of Pt is not obvious at higher temperature (above 400 8C), since at high temperature the exchange rate in bare CeO2 is already fast.
