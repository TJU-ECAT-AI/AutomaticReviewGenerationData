Figure 10 Figure 10. DFT calculations of binding energies of hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt3dPt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. (27) The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE. As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. For example, DFT results indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPtPt(111), Pt(111), and Ni(111), suggesting that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure should be more effective for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the other three surfaces. This has been confirmed experimentally by comparing the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on these four surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), as shown in Figure 11. (27) As illustrated in the TPD peak area of the cyclohexane product, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure shows the highest hydrogenation yield, with the desorption peak centered at a very low temperature of 203 K. Similar Pt-terminated bimetallic surface structures can be produced by depositing one monolayer of Pt on a Ni(111) substrate, which also possesses the novel low-temperature pathway for cyclohexene hydrogenation. (53) Figure 11 Figure 11. (a) TPD of hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(111) monometallic and bimetallic surfaces; (b) volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and surface d-band center value of 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (27) The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are even weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Although this might suggest that the former two surfaces would be more active toward hydrogenation than PtNiPt(111); one should keep in mind that the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to take place. One would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e., when the adsorption of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Figure 11b. The hydrogenation yield from TPD measurements is the highest on PtNiPt(111) but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, where the binding of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. On the other side of the volcano curve, the binding energies of cyclohexene on the 3dPtPt(111) surfaces are too strong, preventing the effective hydrogenation of cyclohexene. (27) Extension to Polycrystalline Ni/Pt Films Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated earlier in Figure 4, it is possible to assume that the surface chemistry of a bimetallic nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for an fcc nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extension. (33) This is verified by studying cyclohexene hydrogenation on PtNiPt subsurface structures prepared on a polycrystalline Pt film consisting of mainly the (111) and (100) facets. (239) Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on a Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure. (33) Similar to the corresponding single-crystal surfaces, the subsurface PtNiPt polycrystalline structure shows significantly higher hydrogenation activity than that from the polycrystalline Pt and Ni surfaces. These results confirm the assumption that the trend observed on single-crystal bimetallic surfaces can be extended to the polycrystalline counterparts.
Reactor Evaluation of Supported Ni/Pt Catalysts Supported monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts have been synthesized on γ-Al2O3 using the incipient wetness method. (280, 303) Characterization of the catalysts by a variety of techniques, including EXAFS, confirms the formation of Pt3d bimetallic bonds. As shown earlier in Figure 5, the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is Pt-terminated and resembles the subsurface PtNiPt structure. The Pt-terminated configuration is also consistent with results by Sedlacek et al. that the surfaces of PtNi alloys are enriched in Pt when treated with H2, (304) as well as with findings reported by Arenas-Alatorre et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on SiO2 (305) and by Mu et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on graphite. (209) Because the Pt-terminated structure is thermodynamically stable in the presence of hydrogen (Figure 6), one would expect that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst should be very active for cyclohexene hydrogenation.
The supported catalysts were evaluated using both batch and flow reactors to determine the hydrogenation kinetics of cyclohexene at a low temperature of 303 K. The hydrogenation rate constants were determined to be 1.7, 21, and 24 min1 for Pt/γ-Al2O3, PtCo/γ-Al2O3, and PtNi/γ-Al2O3, respectively. (280) The trend observed in the rate constant for cyclohexene hydrogenation is consistent with that from the single-crystal surfaces for the same reaction, PtNiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > Pt(111), as shown earlier in the volcano curve in Figure 11b. The similar trend between DFT predictions on single-crystal surfaces, UHV experimental studies on single-crystal and polycrystalline model surfaces, and reactor evaluation over supported catalysts provides an important demonstration of designing bimetallic catalysts from combined theoretical and experimental approaches.
4.1.1.2 Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of Olefins, Dienes, and Aromatics
Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of CC bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.
Hydrogenation of 1,3-Butadiene, 1,3-Cyclohexadiene, And 1,4-Cyclohexadiene Bimetallic PtM (M = Co, Ni, Cu) are active toward the low-temperature hydrogenation of all three molecules when supported on γ-Al2O3. (238, 243) PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts both show higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt. The PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows lower activity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 in batch and flow reactor studies; however, PtCu/γ-Al2O3 shows higher selectivity toward cyclohexene and butenes than the other catalysts, indicating that it is a promising catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions. (238, 243) Similarly to the PtNi bimetallic catalyst, the surface structure of the PtCu catalyst has been shown to be influenced by the surrounding atmosphere. (307) The PtFe/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst also shows higher selectivity toward 1-butene rather than full hydrogenation to n-butane. (288) The hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has also been used as a probe reaction to further understand the catalytic properties of supported PtNi catalysts. Combined EXAFS characterization and reactor studies compare PtNi catalysts prepared using either sequential or coimpregnation methods. The results reveal that coimpregnation leads to higher hydrogenation activity and that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation. (143) Furthermore, by comparing the hydrogenation activity of PtNi supported over low- and high-surface-area alumina and zirconia, it is revealed that the surface area of the oxide supports also plays a role in controlling the hydrogenation rate of 1,3-butadiene. (276) Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene in Ethylene The selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene is an important reaction because acetylene poisons the catalysts in ethylene polymerization reactions. (308) The PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts show a higher selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of excess ethylene than the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. (303) The selective hydrogenation of acetylene is also a probe reaction to determine the effect of impregnation sequence of the Pt and Ni metal precursors. By impregnating Pt first, the bimetallic catalyst is much more active for acetylene hydrogenation. EXAFS measurements confirm bimetallic bond formation in the Pt-first catalyst but not in the Ni-first catalyst, likely due to the possible diffusion of Ni2+ into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support to produce Ni aluminate. However, at higher Ni loadings the impregnation sequence does not seem to play an important role. (303) Hydrogenation of Aromatics The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is of significant importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental protection. The process of benzene hydrogenation has been utilized commercially for the production of cyclohexane, which is one of the key intermediates in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and Nylon-66. (309) DFT calculations identified PtCo bimetallic catalysts as promising materials for the hydrogenation of benzene, which were confirmed experimentally over supported PtCo/γ-Al2O3 at a relatively low temperature of 343 K. (280, 310) The hydrogenation rate over PtCo/γ-Al2O3 was significantly higher than that over Co/γ-Al2O3 or Pt/γ-Al2O3. (279, 280) Comparative studies have also been performed on different supports that reveal that hydrogenation of benzene at 343 K over PtCo bimetallic catalysts follows the activity trend of activated carbon (AC)  SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The AC support exhibits the highest activity and performance due to the greatest extent of PtCo bimetallic formation from the EXAFS measurements. (277) Another feature of PtCo supported catalysts is that almost all Pt atoms in these catalysts exist in the form of PtCo, and the remaining Co forms a Co phase on the metal oxide support. (295) In addition to bimetallic bond formation, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts improve performance by increasing the reducibility of alloyed metals. (171, 311) For example, PtNi, Pt, and Ni supported on SiO2 and mixed TiO2 + SiO2 oxides were tested for the hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexane for the production of cleaner-burning fuels. TPR experiments indicated that Pt promoted the reducibility of NiO, partially explaining the increased activity of the bimetallic PtNi catalyst compared with either monometallic catalyst. (278) Reports of hydrogenation activity on PtPd catalysts have been conflicting. PtPd catalysts supported on mixed magnesium and aluminum oxides are active for the removal of aromatics from diesel fuel to lower emissions. A higher Pd/Pt ratio leads to higher hydrogenation of naphthalene. (138) However, the activity of PtPd/γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of toluene does not show any synergistic activity, with the activity of the bimetallic catalyst being simply the sum of the activity of each monometallic catalyst. (168) The difference in reports seen on PtPd may be due to different preparation techniques because different techniques have been shown to strongly influence the degree of bimetallic bond formation. (312) PtPd catalysts have exhibited a stronger bimetallic effect and greater sulfur tolerance when promoted with fluorine. PtPd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation for hydrogenation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. PtPd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than the unpromoted PtPd catalyst. EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted at high conversions of reactants, but the catalysts synthesized with F did not exhibit a disruption of the PtPd bonds. (139) Babu et al. have shown that the interaction of Pt with Pd led to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states at the Pd sites. This electronic modification may be the cause of improved catalytic performance of PtPd catalysts with high coordination numbers for bimetallic PtPd bonds. (313) Hydrogenation of m-Cresol The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of m-cresol was performed over PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 to determine the role of hydrogenation for HDO. (314) The bimetallic catalysts were found to be very active toward the saturation of the aromatic ring, leading to a facile HDO rate in combination with the dehydration function of the γ-Al2O3 support. Because of the importance of HDO in converting biomass-derived oxygenates to fuels and chemicals, it is anticipated that the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt3d bimetallic catalysts should play a significant role in HDO catalysis.
4.1.2 CO Hydrogenation
Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319) In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation. The rest of the section will focus on using bimetallic surfaces and catalysts to promote the selective CO bond hydrogenation in unsaturated aldehydes.
4.1.2.1 Example: Hydrogenation of Propanal
The hydrogenation of propanal is used as a probe reaction to correlate the activity of CO bond hydrogenation over PtNi bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. (245) DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation. UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity, with the PtNiPt subsurface structure demonstrating much higher activity for propanal hydrogenation than Pt, Ni, and the NiPtPt surface structure. The UHV results are extended to supported PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts. In the gas-phase hydrogenation of propanal, batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. (245) The excellent correlation between DFT predictions, UHV studies on model surfaces, and catalytic evaluation of supported catalysts demonstrates the feasibility to predict bimetallic catalysts with enhanced CO hydrogenation activity.
Using similar approaches, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations were performed for CO bond hydrogenation of acetaldehyde (246) and acetone (246, 247) over supported Pt3d bimetallic catalysts. PtCo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts. (246) Acetone hydrogenation was used as a probe reaction to determine the effect of oxide supports over PtNi supported on SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2 at 308 K. (247) It was found that PtNi/SiO2 exhibited significantly higher hydrogenation activity than the other supports. These hydrogenation results correlate well with EXAFS data showing the extent of PtNi bond formation of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. (247)
4.1.2.2 Selective Hydrogenation of CO in Unsaturated Aldehydes
The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. (17, 241) DFT binding energies of acrolein on H/PtNiPt(111), H/NiPtPt(111), and H/Pt(111) surfaces are calculated using di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) adsorption configurations, as shown in Figure 12a. (17) Figure 12b shows the hydrogen and acrolein binding energies on the three surfaces. The DFT results show that the binding energies of acrolein are in the order of H/PtNiPt(111) < H/Pt(111) < H/NiPtPt(111). (17) On the H/Pt(111) and H/NiPtPt(111) surfaces, acrolein tends to be adsorbed through the di-σ-CC mode, whereas on the H/PtNiPt(111) surface, the similar binding energies will lead acrolein to be adsorbed through both the CO and CC moieties. The direct interaction of the CO group in the latter bonding configuration at least partially contributes to the experimentally observed hydrogenation of the CO bond on the H/PtNiPt(111) surface. In comparison, bonding of acrolein occurs through the CC moiety over H/Pt and H/NiPtPt(111) surfaces, preventing the selective hydrogenation of the CO bonds. (17, 241) The presence of the di-σ-CO configuration has also been proposed for the adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on PtFe/SiO2, responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond for the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols. (286) Figure 12 Figure 12. (a) Side view and top view of configurations of adsorbed acrolein through di-σ-CC, di-σ-CO, and η4(C,C,C,O) on the PtNiPt(111) surface. (b) DFT calculations of acrolein and hydrogen binding energies versus the surface d-band center for H/PtNiPt(111), H/Pt(111), and H/NiPtPt(111) surfaces. (17) The selective hydrogenation of acrolein has been extensively investigated over many Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. On unsupported PtPd catalysts, it was found that the metal ratios strongly affected the hydrogenation products. For acrolein hydrogenation at temperatures from 293 to 473 K, it was found that propanal was the primary product for all catalysts. However, for the secondary products, dipropyl ether was formed primarily over Pd, whereas propane and propanol were formed over Pt. As the surface of the bimetallic catalyst increased in Pt atoms, the catalyst behaved more like the monometallic Pt catalyst. (289) Although Au is typically regarded as an inactive metal for hydrogenation reactions, combining Au with Pt can greatly increase its activity. (281) Au is a poor hydrogenation metal because it does not dissociatively adsorb H2. (320) UHV studies have shown that CO binds to the surface of Pt on top of Au(111) more strongly than to clean Pt because the Au substrate increases the activity of the Pt overlayer, with the change in the CO binding energy being proportional to the shift of the d-band center of the Pt metal. (320, 321) Such a modification effect on model surfaces has also been observed in supported PtAu catalysts. PtAu/SiO2 catalysts were found to be highly active for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds because of the synergism between the Pt and Au metals. (281, 322) The high hydrogenation activity of PtAu could be a result of the rapid H2 dissociation on Pt and PtAu nanoparticles supported on SiO2 and TiO2. H2 dissociation on PtAu and Pt is considerably faster than H2 dissociation on Au, because H2 adsorption on Pt atoms is dissociative and no activation barriers are involved. (320) In addition to greater hydrogenation activity, PtAu shows enhanced resistance to deactivation when compared with a monometallic Pt catalyst. (147) In general, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes over Pt-based catalysts usually yields the saturated aldehydes as the dominant products because of defect sites present in the metallic structure. Defects on metal surfaces favor interactions with the CC moiety, which account for the undesired aldehyde products. It is hypothesized that 100% selectivity can be achieved through careful control of the size and shape of metallic active sites. (298) Tsang et al. confirmed that, at larger crystal sizes, Pt nanoparticles were more active for selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in cinnamaldehyde. This is because the fraction of defect sites on Pt nanoparticles decreases with increasing Pt crystal size. Hydrogenation of the CO bond in crotonaldehyde over PtSn supported on SiO2 and α-Al2O3 demonstrated that the particle-size effect was not as important on bimetallic catalysts as it was on monometallic catalysts. This was because the addition of Sn had a greater effect on the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol than the change in particle size. (299) Therefore, to increase the selectivity toward hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond with smaller metallic nanoparticles, it is necessary to add a second metal. This can be achieved by the addition of a more electropositive metal such as Co, (166, 298) Ge, (150) Fe, (150, 284) Ga, (140) Ni, (284) or Sn. (284) For the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the addition of Co to Pt nanoparticles produces cinnamyl alcohol as the primary product with a selectivity of 99.6%. (298) PtCo nanoparticles were prepared within a critical size range of 4.06.1 nm by colloid chemistry and then were applied to carbon supports. It was found that the PtCo/C catalysts hydrogenated the terminal CO bond with high activity, while the catalyst was inactive toward the CC bond. (298) These results were confirmed by Zheng et al., who showed that PtCo/SiO2 was much more selective toward the hydrogenation of the CO bond than of CC in cinnamaldehyde. (301) PtSn catalysts have also been shown to be active for selective hydrogenation reactions, with the hydrogenation activity and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols being highly dependent on the Sn/Pt ratio. It is suggested that the carbonyl group of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is activated by a Sn species interacting with the oxygen atom, while dilution of Pt atoms by metallic Sn hinders the hydrogenation of the CC bond and suppresses the readsorption of the unsaturated alcohol. (150, 285) Catalysts with Pt and Sn in close contact are more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as compared with catalysts with a lesser interaction. (140) The interaction of Sn and Pt in PtSn nanoparticles is known to be affected by the catalyst-preparation method and impregnation sequence. Co-impregnation of the fumed Al2O3 support with Pt and small amounts of Sn facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion; however, sequential impregnation of the fumed Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion. (323) In addition to the metal affecting selectivity, the support has been found to play a major role in PtSn catalysts. A carbon nanotube (CNT) support can be useful to concentrate reactants in an area close to the active metal, (300) whereas supports that exchange oxygen with the reactants, such as TiO2, (297) ZnO, (324) or CeO2, (324) have been shown to dramatically affect reaction chemistry. The addition of Sn to a Pt catalyst on a reducible support can influence the ability of the support to remove surface carbon through oxygen exchange (324) and help to maintain Sn in a fully reduced state. (325) The removal of surface carbon is critical to prevent deactivation of the catalyst. For example, on TiO2, selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was performed over Pt/TiO2 and PtSn/TiO2 catalysts after reduction at 473 and 773 K. The bimetallic catalyst reduced at high temperature was much more active for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The CO bond was selectively hydrogenated because partially reduced TiOx species contain oxygen vacancies that interact with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and participate in the hydrogenation. (283) In another example, a PtGe/TiO2 catalyst hydrogenated citral into unsaturated alcohols where both oxidized Ge and TiO2 species participated in the activation of the CO bond, indicating there was a strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI), but at higher metal loadings the bimetallic effect was dominant. (152) PtSn catalysts have been found to be active for the partial hydrogenation of furfural when supported on NaY zeolites and SiO2. (142, 291) PtSn/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized with varying amounts of Sn, and all catalysts produced furfuryl alcohol from furfural with selectivities greater than 95%. Bimetallic catalysts were more active than the monometallics but exhibited some degree of deactivation. The PtSn catalyst synthesized with a ratio of 1:0.3 Pt/Sn deactivated at the lowest rate. (142) High hydrogenation activity is favored in large PtSn particles because of the presence of a higher amount of oxidized Sn on the surface of the particles. (284, 311)
4.1.2.3 Hydrogenation of CO in Other Molecules
The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride can produce many different products, but only some of the products are valuable in industry. Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. PtNi catalyzed the reaction for the production of succinic acid with 100% conversion and high selectivity to succinic anhydride. (292, 293) The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid. Adding small amounts of Pt to Fe/SiO2 catalysts increased Fe reducibility, increased activity by 10 times, lowered the apparent activation energy, and maintained the selectivity to acetaldehyde at >70%. On carbon-supported catalysts, the addition of Pt to Fe/C prevented deactivation associated with iron carbide formation. (287) Amines are important compounds for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs. A simple method to form amines is by the reduction of amides, but amides are considered difficult to reduce. Burch et al. found that PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts, synthesized by impregnation, were able to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine, an amine. Figure 13 shows that both Pt impregnated onto a Re/TiO2 catalyst and Re impregnated onto a Pt/TiO2 catalyst showed conversions over 80%, much greater than those of either monometallic catalyst. γ-Al2O3 and CeZrO4 supported catalysts were also effective for hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, but the TiO2-based catalysts exhibited increased activity over the other supports due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. DFT studies showed that Re sites activated the CO bond while Pt aided in the reduction of ReO groups. The parent monometallic catalysts were not active in this reaction, indicating that close interaction between Re and Pt was critical in providing an active catalyst. (290) Figure 13 Figure 13. Variation of amide conversion as a function of time for the hydrogenation of N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one at 120 C, 20 bar H2, stirred at 1500 rpm in hexane using () 4 wt % Pt4 wt % Re/TiO2, () 4 wt % Re4 wt % Pt/TiO2, () 4 wt % Pt/TiO2, and () 4 wt % Re/TiO2.

Other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have also shown increased hydrogenation activity such as Ti, (322) Zr, (322) Hf, (322) and Zn (283) for CO and CC hydrogenation, Ag (326) for CC hydrogenation, and Mo (296) for CO hydrogenation. For CO hydrogenation, PtMo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts were much more active than the monometallic catalysts because Pt aided in the reduction of Mo. Mo segregated to the surface of the supported nanoparticles, and the segregation was unaffected by the sequence of the metal addition. EXAFS results showed that MoMo bond lengths were near that of Pt with Mo on the surface of the metallic nanoparticles. (296)
4.1.3 NO and CN Hydrogenation
Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is an important industrial process to manufacture the nylon monomer, hexamethylenediamine, from adiponitrile. Butyronitrile has been used as a model compound for CN hydrogenation because it only contains one nitrile group. In liquid-phase experiments, Siepen et al. found that PtRh/AC catalysts synthesized by a colloid method were active for hydrogenation of the CN bond in butyronitrile. EXAFS measurements indicated that Rh atoms were concentrated at the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles. This finding was confirmed by CO FTIR, which showed a characteristic Rh-dicarbonyl species bound to the catalyst. It was hypothesized that the Pt core atoms draw electrons from the Rh surface atoms, possibly explaining the enhanced hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalyst. Enhanced activity was seen on PtRh bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation and not in catalysts synthesized with coimpregnation of both metals. (282) Huang and Sachtler (327) investigated the hydrogenation of acetonitrile and butyronitrile in the gas phase in a fixed-bed microreactor and in the liquid phase in an autoclave. They found that addition of Pt to Ni supported on NaY zeolite promotes the reduction of Ni2+ and increases the hydrogenation rate of butyronitrile in both the gas and liquid phases. Catalysts with Cu and Pt also supported on NaY zeolite show increased reduction of the metal alloyed with Pt, but the activity is lower for acetonitrile hydrogenation. Addition of Sn to Pt on SiO2 decreases the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation but increases the selectivity to secondary amines. (327) Synthesis of aromatic haloamines is important for the production of dyes, herbicides, and pesticides. Metal catalysts are preferred for the hydrogenation of halonitroaromatics to reduce the environmental impact of traditional hydrogenation with HCl. Liu et al. found that PVP-stabilized PtRu colloids, prepared by a colloid-synthesis method, selectively hydrogenated the NO bond of o-chloronitrobenzene to form o-chloroaniline. Catalysts were characterized by TEM, XPS, and XRD, and the reaction was performed in methanol at 303 K. The hydrogenation was most effective with particles composed of 2090% Ru, with Co2+ added to the reaction vessel. (328) Similar studies on PtRu/γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of NO in 2,5-dichloronitrobenzene also showed high activity and selectivity. (329) PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts can be used for the reduction of nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen for the treatment of drinking water. A bimetallic catalyst is advantageous for this process because copper can reduce nitrates and nitrites but deactivates rapidly in water, whereas monometallic platinum catalysts are inactive for nitrate reduction. By alloying Pt with Cu, the Cu is maintained in a metallic state while the reaction occurs in an aqueous environment. Monometallic catalysts were prepared by impregnation, and bimetallic catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation or reductive deposition of the second metal. Catalysts were characterized with TEM to confirm nanoparticle size, and CO FTIR was used to confirm the accessibility of Pt on the catalytic support. Reactions performed in an aqueous-phase batch reactor at 283 K showed that nitrates were quickly reduced on the PtCu bimetallic catalyst when both metals were in close contact. Although required for high activity, the addition of copper slightly lowered the selectivity to nitrogen and raised the selectivity to NH4+. (330) PtIn supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2, prepared by impregnation, were also active for the reduction of nitrates in drinking water. XPS and TPR results showed that the catalytic surfaces were enriched in In, but catalysts deactivated quickly due to segregation of the Pt and In. (331)

4.2.1 NH Bond Scission
Ammonia is regarded as an important hydrogen-storage medium in a hydrogen economy due to its facile decomposition to produce hydrogen. However, the leading catalyst, Ru, is expensive and scarce, preventing it from large-scale commercial utilization. Hansgen et al. (14) have used microkinetic modeling combined with DFT calculations to build a model to identify alternative bimetallic catalysts for ammonia decomposition. A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14. Table 6 shows a library of nitrogen-binding energies on various bimetallic surfaces, in which the NiPtPt(111) surface exhibits a nitrogen-binding energy of 130.7 kcal/mol, (14) slightly lower than the optimal value. Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface NiPtPt(111), subsurface PtNiPt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111). Consistent with the DFT and microkinetic prediction, the NiPtPt(111) surface shows high activity for ammonia decomposition whereas the other three surfaces are inactive. (14) By comparing the desorption temperature of atomic nitrogen from the NiPtPt(111) surface with that on Ru(0001), (341) the results show that the recombinative desorption temperature of nitrogen is lower on NiPtPt(111), making it a potentially more active catalyst for NH3 decomposition. Hansgen et al. (253) have performed further investigations on the decomposition of ammonia on bimetallic surfaces prepared by the deposition of a monolayer of Fe, Co, or Cu on Pt(111) computationally and experimentally. The results reveal that the FePtPt(111) and CoPtPt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the CuPtPt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6.
Figure 14 Figure 14. Ammonia decomposition volcano curve. (14) Table 6. Library of DFT Binding Energies and Bond Lengths of Nitrogen Atoms at 1/9 ML Coverage on Various Monolayer Bimetallic Surfaces (14) Although the dehydrogenation of NH3 has not been extended to reactor studies of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the production of H2 from NH2NH2 has been reported on supported PtNi catalysts. (334) Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials. Singh and Xu have recently explored unsupported PtNi nanocatalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce H2 and N2 in a liquid-phase batch reactor at room temperature. Their results demonstrate that catalysts with Pt content between 7 and 31 mol % exhibit 100% hydrogen selectivity, whereas the corresponding Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts show no activity. (334)
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission
The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline. Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed. Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained. (335) There is a general agreement that Pt is very active for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons; however, Pt bonds too strongly to the unsaturated carbon intermediates, leading to the formation of coke and deactivation. Therefore, the strategy to improve the dehydrogenation activity is to alloy Pt with another metal to reduce the bonding of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Such a hypothesis is verified in DFT calculations and UHV studies for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene on PtAu surfaces. (254) As shown in the TPD results in Figure 15a, the production of benzene is enhanced after depositing 0.5 ML Au on Pt, which shows higher benzene yield than on either Pt or Au/Pt surfaces with higher Au coverages. The corresponding AES measurements (Figure 15b) show significant carbon accumulation on unmodified Pt after the TPD experiments, confirming that the Pt bonds too strongly to cyclohexene and decomposes it to produce atomic carbon. In comparison, no carbon accumulation is detected on the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface after the same experimental procedures. The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst.
Figure 15 Figure 15. Selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on polycrystalline PtAu bimetallic surfaces. (254) Similarly, as described in the previous sections, DFT calculations predict that subsurface PtNiPt(111) also binds to unsaturated hydrocarbons more weakly than unmodified Pt(111). This is consistent with experimental observations that PtNiPt(111) is more active for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene than either of the parent metal surfaces. (15) Because the Pt-terminated surface should be preferred under the reducing environment of dehydrogenation reactions, the DFT and UHV results suggest that supported PtNi catalysts should be effective dehydrogenation catalysts. This is confirmed in reactor studies that show PtNi/γ-Al2O3 is more active for dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene than either monometallic catalyst. (244) The effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation is also found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation over PtNi/AC. Hydrogen production on the bimetallic catalysts is enhanced by 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt % Ni catalyst and by 60 times as compared to the 0.5 wt % Pt catalyst. (336) In addition to PtAu and PtNi, modification of Pt by Sn also enhances the resistance to carbon accumulation. Extensive UHV studies by Koel and co-workers have revealed that the addition of Sn on the Pt(111) surface decreases the binding energies of adsorbed molecules. (235, 248, 249) The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene. Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity. Reactor studies also show that adding only a small amount of Sn to Pt catalysts improves the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate.
Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts supported on ZnAlO and mixed spinel Al2O3/γ-Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst. (332) Similar results are observed for isobutane dehydrogenation over PtSn/γ-Al2O3. The selectivity to butenes increases from 53% for the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst up to 8590% for the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. (335) The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst. (283) Catalytic activity over PtSn improves by pretreating the catalysts with H2 and O2 prior to reaction because of increased metal dispersion on the support. (338) Other metals that promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt are Bi, (340) Re, (339) Pd, (342, 343)In, (333) and Fe. (286) Pt supported on spinel Al2O3 synthesized with Sn, Cu, and In are active for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes because these catalysts can withstand harsh reducing and oxidizing conditions. (333) Over PtFe/SiO2, dehydrogenation activity is enhanced because Pt aids in the reduction of Fe as confirmed by FTIR. Although small amounts of Fe improve catalytic performance, large amounts of Fe lead to rapid deactivation due to the formation of an iron oxide phase. (286) Dwindling crude oil reserves and strict air pollution regulations have made reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline an attractive economic opportunity. Liu et al. recently utilized a template synthesis procedure to formulate PtRe/γ-Al2O3 with high activity for naphtha dehydrogenation. (339) The synthesis method involved a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) template to control the morphology of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the support. TEM and CO chemisorption studies showed similar particle sizes between catalysts synthesized with PAA and catalysts synthesized by traditional impregnation methods. FTIR results of CO adsorption indicated that less bridged CO was present in the catalyst synthesized with PAA, suggesting a lower surface Pt coordination number. Reaction studies performed at 766 and 769 K showed that catalysts prepared with PAA exhibited a 1.42.4% higher yield and a longer projected lifetime over commercial PtRe catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation. Although small, a 1% increase in yield represents a significant economic prospect in an industry that produces 11 million barrels of reformate from naphtha per day. (339) Another study of naphtha dehydrogenation was performed over PtRe/γ-Al2O3. (344) The bimetallic interactions were analyzed using EXAFS and both the Pt LIII and Re LIII edges were analyzed. If the catalysts were dried in air at temperatures  773 K prior to reduction, bimetallic bonds were formed. However, if the catalysts were dried at higher temperatures, the transport of Re was inhibited and there were fewer bimetallic interactions, leading to lower activity. (344) The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage. Gasoline and diesel are both currently available, and using them as a hydrogen carrier instead of direct fuels could achieve some immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. (345) Bimetallic PtNi and PtPd catalysts supported on alumina or ceria have been shown to be active for diesel dehydrogenation. Both bimetallic catalysts not only improved the activity but also increased resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel reforming. The enhanced stability of the bimetallic catalysts is due to strong metalmetal and metalsupport interactions that change the electronic properties of the metals. These changes in electronic properties improve sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance. (342, 343) PtRh is another active bimetallic catalyst for gasoline dehydrogenation. PtRh supported on a ceramic monolith was used for E85 dehydrogenation with 100% conversion at low flow rates without deactivation. At higher flow rates, the catalyst was unstable, and adding small amounts of sulfur to the feed led to irreversible deactivation due to coking. XPS studies revealed that the catalyst had a change in oxidation state after continuous time-on-stream. (345) PtRh supported on ZrO2 was superior to both monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate for gasoline dehydrogenation. The addition of a small amount Rh to the Pt catalyst increased conversion from 30% to 70%. (346)
4.3 Reforming of Oxygenates
Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348) If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage. Table 7 summarizes selected reactor studies of oxygenate reforming over supported catalysts; selected UHV studies of reforming over bimetallic surfaces are listed in Table 3.

4.3.1 Reforming of Alcohols and Polyols
4.3.1.1 Pt3d Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
Small oxygenates, such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, have been studied on 3d/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces to determine the bond scission sequence of oxygenate molecules. The desirable reaction pathway is selective CC bond scission, to produce H2 and CO. DFT calculations were carried out to study the trend in the binding energies of oxygenates on bimetallic surfaces. Figure 16 shows the binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol, and ethoxy on Pt(111), Ni(111), PtNiPt(111), and NiPtPt(111) surfaces. (264) A nearly linear correlation between binding energy and the surface d-band center was observed, consistent with the theory of chemisorption by Hammer and Nrskov (302) and with the trends observed for other adsorbates in previous sections. The binding energies increase as the surface d-band center shifts closer to the Fermi level, with the NiPtPt(111) surface showing the highest binding energies. The binding energies of molecular oxygenate species are low on all surfaces, between 3 and 12 kcal/mol. After removing the first hydrogen, the methoxy and ethoxy species adsorb more strongly to the surface, with binding energies ranging from 30 to 55 kcal/mol.
Figure 16 Figure 16. DFT results for binding energies of methanol, methoxy, ethanol, and ethoxy on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. (256) Reproduced with permission from ref 256. Copyright 2008 Springer.TPD measurements were carried out to monitor the reaction pathways of oxygenates on various Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. The oxygenate molecules studied included methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. (258, 264, 259) H2 and CO were detected from TPD experiments as the main products from the four oxygenate molecules. No other product was observed with the exception of methane, which was produced after adsorption of ethanol. (258, 264) On Pt(111), methanol adsorbed reversibly on the surface without undergoing decomposition, consistent with previous studies. (255, 369-371) In contrast, significant amounts of H2 and CO were produced from methanol reforming on the NiPtPt(111) surface. On the basis of the H2 and CO yields, the reforming activity follows the order of PtNiPt(111) < Pt(111) < Ni(111) < NiPtPt(111).Similar trends in the reforming yields are observed for ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol. The oxygenate reforming yields obtained experimentally are correlated with the surface d-band center in Figure 17. (257-259) In general, the oxygenate reforming yield displays a somewhat linear correlation and increases as the surface d-band center is shifted closer to the Fermi level. It is important to point out that the trend is opposite of that observed for hydrogenation reactions on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces (Figure 11). The comparison indicates that surfaces that bind adsorbates more strongly, such as NiPtPt(111), promote reforming reactions. One would also predict that at sufficiently high binding energies oxygenates would undergo complete decomposition instead of reforming. This is confirmed experimentally by comparing the reforming of ethanol and ethylene glycol (257) on Fe/Pt(111), Ti/Pt(111), and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, where a volcano relationship is observed between reforming yield and binding energies. For example, on the TiPtPt(111) surface the binding energies become too strong, leading to a large fraction of oxygenates undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and oxygen instead of CO. (257) Figure 17 Figure 17. Reforming yields of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol versus the surface d-band center. (256) Reproduced with permission from ref 256. Copyright 2008 Springer.Using reforming of methanol and ethylene glycol as probe reactions, a similar trend in reforming activity is observed on PtNi surfaces prepared on a polycrystalline Pt substrate. (262) On both substrates the NiPtPt bimetallic surface shows higher reforming yield than PtNiPt, Pt, and Ni surfaces, demonstrating the possibility to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal and polycrystalline materials for reforming reactions.Reactor studies of aqueous-phase reforming of ethylene glycol show that supported bimetallic PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe catalysts are significantly more active per gram of catalyst and have higher turnover frequencies (TOFs) for hydrogen production than monometallic Pt catalysts. (349) As shown in Figure 18, the bimetallic catalyst with a 1:1 Pt/Ni ratio shows the higher TOF for H2 production. On the basis of the DFT and UHV results in Figure 17, the enhanced reforming activity observed on the PtNi bimetallic catalyst can be explained by two somewhat conflicting possibilities. (1) If the structure of the supported catalyst is Pt-terminated, i.e., similar to the PtNiPt subsurface structure, the binding of CO and hydrogen would be weaker on the PtNi bimetallic catalyst than on the Pt monometallic catalyst (Figure 10a), thereby increasing the fraction of surface sites available for reaction with ethylene glycol. (349) (2) If the structure of the supported catalyst is transformed to Ni-terminated due to the adsorption of oxygenates, the higher reforming activity would be consistent with the UHV results of NiPtPt(111) being more active than Pt(111) for reforming reactions (Figure 17). The exact origin of the bimetallic enhancement can only be determined by in situ measurement of the surface termination of supported PtNi catalysts, such as by EXAFS under aqueous-phase reforming conditions.Figure 18 Figure 18. Fixed-bed reactor results for APR of 10 wt % ethylene glycol solutions at 483 K and 25.4 bar over PtNi bimetallic catalysts. (a) TOFH2 (black) and alkane selectivity (gray); (b) specific H2 production rate (black) and irreversible CO chemisorption uptake (gray). (349) Reproduced with permission from ref 349. Copyright 2006 Springer.Supported PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were also found to be effective for ethanol reforming. The catalyst was resistant to coke deposition at a ratio of water to ethanol as low as 3.0. As the amount of water was increased, the conversion and H2 production also increased. (366) Soyal-Baltacolu et al. agreed with these findings and found that the optimum metal loading for a PtNi catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 was 0.3 wt % Pt and 15 wt % Ni. (367)
4.3.1.2 Other Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
Pt-based catalysts have shown activity for reforming reactions when alloyed with Ni, (349-352) Co, (349) Sn, (323) Fe, (349, 353) Pd, (353) Ru, (149, 348, 353, 354) Re, (355, 372) Au, (353, 356) and Rh. (373, 374) Selective and facile methanol reforming offers a potential option for the production of hydrogen on board vehicles powered by fuel cells. Production of on-board hydrogen is an attractive option because it allows hydrogen-containing fuels to be stored and transported in liquid form, for which there is an existing infrastructure. (375) Methanol-reforming studies have been performed over a series of bimetallic PtM (M = Au, Pd, Ru, Fe) catalysts supported on ZrO2. (353) In these studies, catalysts are prepared by micelle synthesis to mitigate the difference of size and shape, thereby attributing variations in activity to the bimetallic effect. Bimetallic catalysts outperform monometallic Pt for methanol reforming in the order of PtFe > PtRu > PtPd > PtAu > Pt. (353) High activity on the PtFe catalysts is attributed to segregation of Fe to the surface of the nanoparticles during calcination due to the high affinity of Fe for oxygen. (353) The support also plays an important role for methanol reforming. Findings by Miyao et al. show that basic oxide supports improve the selectivity of methanol reforming to CO2 (maximizing H2 production) whereas acidic supports suppress the catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest activity and selectivity to CO2 are achieved over TiO2. (354) PtRu catalysts have been found to be more active for ethanol steam reforming than either parent metal; however, catalysts derived from organic clusters are more active than those derived from inorganic salts. (149) PtRh bimetallic catalysts are also effective for ethanol reforming when supported on CeO2. PtRh/CeO2 breaks CH bonds before CC bonds in ethanol; (374) therefore, PtRh could enhance H2 production over alkane formation in ethanol reforming. (373) This hypothesis has been confirmed with studies on PtRh/ZrO2 showing that the bimetallic catalyst reaches a conversion of 100% at temperatures above 973 K, with high selectivity for H2 formation. The bimetallic catalyst also shows improved stability over the monometallic Rh/ZrO2 catalyst due to less coke formation. (365) Another option for reforming is to use glycerol, a waste product from biodiesel production. Reforming of glycerol into syngas in a flow reactor at 548 K shows an increase in H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 concentrations upon adding Re to Pt/C catalysts. (348) Re promotes the overall rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt, which makes surface sites more available to participate in reforming. (348) Supported PtRe catalysts are also more tolerant to carbonaceous residues than supported Pt and, therefore, are less likely to deactivate rapidly. (322) The addition of Ru and Os to Pt/C catalysts has also shown to significantly increase the catalytic activity for glycerol reforming at low temperatures (548573 K). (355)
4.3.2 Reforming of Other Oxygenates
Different from the small alcohols and polyols, the CO functional group is also present in the ring-opened structures of C5 and C6 sugars. Glycolaldehyde, (23) the smallest molecule with both COH and CO bonds as well as the same C/O ratio as the larger sugar molecules, is a good probe molecule to determine how the presence of the CO functional group affects the reforming reaction mechanism. In the DFT study, glycolaldehyde is adsorbed on the atop sites of adjacent metal atoms. The optimized geometry on the NiPtPt(111) surface is shown in parts a and b of Figure 19. As shown in Figure 19c, glycolaldehyde-binding energy (23) is found to increase as the surface d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level, consistent with the trend observed with small alcohols and polyols. According to glycolaldehyde TPD experiments, (23) NiPtPt(111) shows the highest reforming activity and total activity among the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. The activity trend found in experiments is consistent with the DFT prediction based on binding energy and surface d-band center values. On the basis of the comparison of the activity and reaction intermediates of ethylene glycol and glycolaldehyde, the presence of the CO functionality enhances the activity on the Pt(111) surface. In contrast, for surfaces with high activity toward OH bond cleavage, such as the NiPtPt(111) surface, the presence of CO does not significantly affect the activity or reaction pathway of C2 oxygenates. (23) Figure 19 Figure 19. Top and side views of adsorption geometry of glycolaldehyde on NiPtPt(111) and the correlation between the surface d-band center and glycolaldehyde binding energy on different surfaces (23) (Pt, blue; Ni, gray; C, aqua; O, red; H, white).
Figure 19c also includes the glycolaldehyde binding energy and d-band center values on monolayer Ni supported on a tungsten monocarbide (WC) surface. The similar values between the NiPtPt(111) and Ni/WC surfaces suggest similar reforming activity for the two surfaces, which is confirmed experimentally. (23) Such a comparison points out the possibility of using WC to replace Pt in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. More about this subject will be discussed in future research opportunities in section 5.
4.4 Other Important Catalytic Reactions
In this section we will provide an overview of several types of reactions that utilize bimetallic catalysts: CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts. Table 8 lists selected reactor studies for each of the three reactions.
Table 8. Summary of Selected Reactions over Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
4.4.1 CO Oxidation
Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Su et al. (271) have performed DFT calculations of CO oxidation on surfaces of bulk PtNi alloys and Pt(111). On the basis of the binding energies of adsorbed CO, O, and H, as well as the activation barriers for elemental reaction steps of CO and H oxidation, Pt-terminated Pt3Ni(111) is identified as an optimum catalyst for CO PROX in excess of hydrogen. (271) The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface PtFePt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments. (207, 208) The reversibility between these two structures leads to the tunability of the surface PROX activity on Fe/Pt(111). (208) The bimetallic surface transformation study is also carried out over supported Pt3d transition metal (3d = Co, Ni, and Cu) nanoparticles treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres, and the reversible structural changes are also observed. (209) Guided by the formation of FeO/Pt(111) surface after the oxidation treatment of Fe/Pt(111) and its importance in controlling PROX, Yao et al. (396) have prepared two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) surface with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure using a two-step process. The FeO nanoislands are characterized using STM, XPS, and HREELS and are found to exhibit distinct atomic structures and electronic states from the strong interaction between FeO and the Pt(111) substrate. The coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites confined by crystalline matrix and on highly diluted samples are proposed to have high reactivity and stability in oxidation reactions. (397) The confinement effect at the interface between FeO nanoislands and Pt(111) is studied by Fu et al. (272) for CO oxidation. An oxygen-deficient FeO1x/Pt(111) surface shows higher CO oxidation reactivity than Pt(111) and other Fe oxide overlayers, i.e., FeO1+x/Pt(111) surfaces. Attempts are made to prepare the CUF active sites over supported catalysts. The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst shows significantly higher CO PROX activity than Pt/SiO2, with the bimetallic catalyst showing CO oxidation at temperatures as low as 200 K and achieving 100% CO conversion at room temperature. The highly active PtFe nanocatalysts are also found to show excellent stability in a 1-KW PEMFC working system and are thus feasible for industrial application. (272) The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces. Mu et al. (273) have also proposed a synergetic effect of the surface and subsurface Ni species for CO oxidation: the surface Ni oxide nanoislands activate O2 to produce atomic O species, and the subsurface Ni atoms further enhance the elementary reaction of CO oxidation with O.
The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts. PtFe/γ-Al2O3, PtFe2/γ-Al2O3, and PtFe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2. (398) Siani et al. have proposed that the increased activity for CO oxidation correlates with the extent of PtFe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption. (286) PROX of CO over supported Pt/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 shows that the bimetallic catalyst has higher CO conversion with higher CO2 selectivity over a wide reaction temperature range in the presence of excess hydrogen. At low temperature, increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt increases the catalytic activity of PtNi/γ-Al2O3. (377) The coimpregnated PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a much lower reduction temperature than Pt,Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni,Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by sequential impregnation. (376) Alumina is a superior support when compared with TiO2 and ZrO2. (376) PtCo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are also more active than either parent metal for CO oxidation in gas streams containing hydrogen. (378) When supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), PtCo is highly efficient for CO PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423 K. The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ results in enhancement of catalytic performance, especially in the temperature region below 423 K. Isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seem to give rise to the high catalytic activity. (379) Findings by Komatsu and Tamura agree that PtCo/SiO2 catalysts are more effective for PROX than either parent metal. (380) By varying the Pt/Co atomic ratios in the catalysts, a ratio of Pt/Co = 3 is identified as the most effective for the PROX reaction. (380) PtSn/AC is active for CO oxidation when the AC support is treated with HNO3 prior to impregnation. The acid treatment creates an acidic surface that aids in the formation of PtSn alloys. (383) The PtSn catalyst is synthesized by sequential impregnation with high temperature reduction at 673 K. Aksoylu et al. have proposed that sequential impregnation leads to higher activity because less Pt is alloyed with Sn, making more Pt sites available for CO oxidation. (382) Quantum calculations by Glmen et al. on PtSn surfaces show that PtSn bimetallic particles adsorb CO more weakly than Pt alone. The studies also indicate that Sn present in the subsurface configuration strengthens CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn on the surface destabilizes CO adsorption. (399) PtMn/γ-Al2O3 with different loadings of Mn is active for partial oxidation of CO. TPR results indicate that Pt promotes the reduction of Mn to a greater extent and at lower temperatures than monometallic Mn. Catalysts with low Mn content show no improvement in catalytic activity, but CO oxidation activity increases dramatically in catalysts with compositions of Mn above 8 wt %. In the presence of CO2, catalytic activity increases and CO conversion reaches 100% for the 15 wt % Mn, PtMn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of H2O to the feed stream significantly decreases catalytic activity, possibly due to steam poisoning of oxygen vacancies in MnOx. (384) Other metals, such as Pd, (381) Ru, (400) and Re, (385) are active when alloyed with Pt for CO oxidation. PtPd/CeO2, (381) PtRu/SiO2, (400) and PtRe/SiO2 (385) all demonstrate enhanced PROX activity over the corresponding monometallic catalysts. For the latter catalyst, EXAFS analysis confirms the existence of PtRe bimetallic bonds. The synergistic effect occurs when the reduced PtRe bimetallic particles dissociate O2, which then spills over to the Pt particles to oxidize CO. (385)
4.4.2 Water Gas Shift Reaction
Water gas shift (WGS) is an important reaction typically used during and after reforming to increase the yield of H2. CO is oxidized by H2O to produce an additional mole of H2 with CO2 as a waste gas. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, (386, 387) Co, (386) and Au. (388) The alloyed metal and dispersion have been found to play an important role in the activity of WGS. In comparing a series of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts over γ-Al2O3 and TiO2, catalysts containing PtRe and PtCo exhibit a higher WGS activity than Pt, but PtMo, PtSn, and PtCu show a lower WGS activity. Reports by Choung et al. show that PtRe catalysts display higher activity because Re increases Pt dispersion on TiO2 and γ-Al2O3. (386) Sato et al. report that the WGS activity over PtRe/TiO2 exhibits a mild dependence on Re content and a strong dependence on reduction temperature. (387) Additional Re increases the amount of Re on the catalyst surface and leads to an increase in the rate of WGS. (387) Although the metals used for WGS play an important role, the support often participates in the WGS chemistry. For example, adding Pt to a Au/CeO2 catalyst is much more active for WGS than either parent metal. The introduction of Pt to the Au catalyst leads to the formation of a partially oxidized gold species. The presence of Au and Pt also help keep ceria in a Ce3+ state, which creates oxygen vacancies and aids in the overall activity of the catalyst. (388) Kugai et al. examine the enhancement of water gas shift by the addition of oxygen to the feed stream (OWGS). PtCu/CeO2 exhibits higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts, but the higher activity is not as pronounced in traditional WGS. (389) The addition of oxygen to the reaction is suggested to both lower the CO surface coverage and increase the number of available surface sites to participate in the reaction. Another possible explanation is that supported PtCu bimetallic catalysts are reduced more easily than the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
4.4.3 CH4 Conversion
The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel. (289) PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. (390) The enhanced activity of the bimetallic system can be explained by increased reducibility of Co and facilitated chain-growth by Co from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. (390) For CH4 to be used as a direct fuel, it must be fully combusted to CO2 and H2O to reduce environmental impacts, mainly because CH4 is a greenhouse gas that has an even greater global-warming potential than CO2. (401) Studies on catalytic combustion of CH4 over PtPd catalysts show that the bimetallic outperforms monometallic Pd catalysts independent of the catalyst support. (392, 402) The metal particles in PtPd/γ-Al2O3 consist of two phases: a PdO phase and a Pt and Pd alloy. (392, 402) Castellazzi et al. have found that the effect of Pt on PdO for CH4 combustion depends on several factors such as the extent of PdO bond formation and the strength of the Pdsupport interaction. (403) The recent discovery of large natural gas reservoirs has increased efforts in finding efficient processes to partially oxidize CH4 into CO and H2. Lanza et al. have found that PtRu is an active metal combination for CH4 partial oxidation because Pt activates CH4 at low temperature and Ru is selective toward H2 and CO. The bimetallic catalyst begins to show oxidation activity at 823 K for PtRu versus 903 K for the monometallic Ru catalyst. Above 800 K, syngas at a H2/CO ratio of 2 is produced as the favored product. (394, 395) DFT and experimental results show that PtRu coreshell nanoparticles have a weaker CO binding energy than monometallic Pt nanoparticles, leading to lower CO coverage and higher activity. (156) PtNi (391) catalysts have also been evaluated for the partial oxidation of CH4. Small amounts of Pt are added to the Ni catalyst to reduce the extent of Ni oxidation. In this case, the high reducibility of Pt and the high activity of Ni are both utilized. Introduction of Pt to Ni catalysts by sequential impregnation enhances the catalytic performance by keeping Ni reduced in the presence of oxygen. (391) Characterization by TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation are mostly Pt-terminated while catalysts prepared by coimpregnation do not show increased amounts of surface Pt. The lack of surface Pt in the coimpregnated catalyst may lead to rapid deactivation from the oxidation of Ni, possibly explaining the decreased activity.
Steam reforming of CH4 encounters problems of coking and fast deactivation of catalysts. (404) However, research groups have found that PtNi is an effective catalyst for reforming of CH4. (172, 358, 360-362) For example, PtNi supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. (393) Without prereduction, the PtNi bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst. The addition of Pt to the Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst also prevents deactivation by helping the alloyed Ni rereduce from Ni2+ to Ni0. At increased Ni loading the self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics are no longer present. (393) Dry reforming of methane is an attractive process because it utilizes two abundant, cheap compounds as a hydrogen source; however, the process requires high temperatures, and the catalyst deactivates quickly due to coking. Pinheiro et al. show that PtNi supported on polytype A of beta-zeolite (BEA) zeolites has superior activity and stability for dry reforming of methane, compared with γ-Al2O3 and AC supports, due to its high resistance to coking. (359) These findings are confirmed by Arishtirova et al., who find that the addition of Pt to Ni catalysts supported on a NaZSM-5 zeolite leads to better reducibility of the catalyst, higher Ni dispersion, and increased activity and stability for CH4 reforming by CO2. (357) In addition, PtRe (345) supported on ceriazirconia mixed oxides shows enhanced dry reforming activity. The PtRe interaction reduces coke deposition, improves Pt dispersion, and significantly enhances selectivity and stability, while oxygen exchange of the reactants is facilitated by the reducible support.
4.5 Brief Summary of Pt-Based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts
Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized for both anodic and cathodic reactions in low-temperature fuel cells, in particular PEMFCs. For example, PtRu and PtRh based catalysts are promising anode catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol (405) and ethanol, (406) respectively. Pt3d alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Similar to that described for the hydrogenation reaction in section 4.1, the subsurface Pt3dPt structures are preferred for the ORR reaction due to optimized binding with atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups. One of the challenges is to prevent the segregation of subsurface 3d metals to the surface, which is thermodynamically favorable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, as described in section 3.1. The topic of electrocatalysts is beyond the scope of the current review; however, the basic principles, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques in the current review share many common themes with Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts. Interested readers can refer to several recent reviews on bimetallic electrocatalysts. (405, 407, 408)
4.6 Brief Summary of Trimetallic Catalysts
Some recent studies show that trimetallic catalysts exhibit better performance than both monometallic and bimetallic systems. For example, Epron et al. (409) have studied n-heptane reforming on PtSn and PtIrSn/Al2O3 catalysts and find that the addition of Sn to the bimetallic PtIr increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. Compared with PtSn bimetallic catalysts, less Sn is needed in PtIrSn trimetallic catalyst to obtain the same toluene yield. Aranishi et al. (410) have synthesized the Au/Co/Fe triple-layered coreshell nanoparticles that exhibit much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane than the corresponding monometallic (Au, Co, Fe) or bimetallic (AuCo, AuFe, CoFe) catalysts. Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized and exhibit high hydrogenation activity of methyl acrylate at an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm. (411) The mechanism of the promoted reactivity in trimetallic catalysts has also been investigated. For example, Fang et al (412) have studied the electrooxidation of formic acid on Au@Pd@Pt NPs and find a synergistic effect between the three different nanostructure components (sphere, shell, and islands). Using FePtAu nanoparticles as an example, Zhang et al. (413) demonstrate that the presence of Au in FePtAu facilitates FePt structure transformation from chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure. 5 Conclusions and Future Research Opportunities The examples in the current review illustrate the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions.
In comparison, for other types of reactions, such as dehydrogenation and reforming, the desirable Pt3d bimetallic structures should be the 3d-terminated surfaces. However, it is less clear whether these structures are present under dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions. Similarly, more studies are needed to determine the structures and their stability in other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Such understanding is critical in extending the design of bimetallic catalysts from hydrogenation to other types of reactions. Below are some opportunities for future research in the area of bimetallic catalysis:(1) Characterization of bimetallic catalysts under in situ reaction conditions. Because bimetallic structures would most likely change during reactions, it is critical to identify the atomic arrangement of bimetallic catalysts under temperatures, pressures, and reaction media (vapor phase or aqueous phase) relevant to catalytic reactions. One promising in situ technique is EXAFS, which allows measurements of the coordination numbers of monometallic and bimetallic bonds under in situ conditions. Recently in situ EXAFS and XRD have been combined to determine the short-range bonding environment of metal catalysts and the long-range order of oxide supports, respectively, under reaction conditions. (414, 415) These techniques should provide important information on the bimetallic structures and their stability under reaction conditions, which would in turn provide critical input for constructing relevant model surfaces in DFT calculations and UHV studies. To truly achieve the rational design of catalysts from first principles, it is essential that the model systems are as close as possible to those under reaction conditions. This is especially true for bimetallic catalysts due to the adsorbate-induced segregation and diffusion of metal atoms.
(2) Synthesis of stable bimetallic structures. The prevention of metal segregation and diffusion is a challenge under reaction conditions. For example, for the Pt3d bimetallic catalysts, ideally one would design Pt-terminated surfaces for hydrogenation reactions and 3d-terminated catalysts for reforming reactions. Although the synthesis of well-defined coreshell bimetallic catalysts has been demonstrated for Pt3d bimetallic electrocatalysts, (407) it is unlikely that such well-defined coreshell structures, in particular the maintenance of Pt or 3d as the surface atoms, would survive the relatively harsh conditions of calcination and reduction treatment in typical heterogeneous catalysis. One possibility to prevent the metal movement is to increase the activation barriers of segregation/diffusion by anchoring one or both metal atoms by the catalyst supports, although the strong metalsupport interaction might change the electronic and catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts.
(3) Metal carbides as substrates in bimetallic catalysts. Another possibility is to replace Pt with a metal-like substrate that prevents the diffusion of the 3d metals. For example, Ni-terminated PtNi surfaces are identified as effective catalysts for the reforming of alcohols and polyols. However, under reduction conditions or higher temperatures the surface Ni atoms would diffuse into bulk Pt, losing the high reforming activity. Recently, tungsten carbide (WC) was utilized to replace Pt because WC often shows catalytic properties similar to Pt (416) and is an effective diffusion barrier layer for surface metal atoms. (417) A comparative DFT and UHV study confirms that monolayer NiPt and NiWC surfaces show nearly identical reforming activity for ethanol. (261) A recent study also demonstrates that other carbides, including W2C and Mo2C, can be used to replace Pt to support monolayer metals. (418-421) Synthesis efforts to extend these model surfaces to powder catalysts will lead to the production of alternative bimetallic catalysts with higher stability and lower cost.(4) Correlation between model systems and catalytic reactions through theory. In addition to experimental efforts, calculations through multiscale modeling offer additional opportunities to correlate results on model surfaces to catalytic performance over supported catalysts. For example, recently Vlachos and co-workers have demonstrated the feasibility of creating activity maps to predict catalytic activity and selectivity of several Pt-based bimetallic catalysts using a combination of DFT calculations, linear energy correlations, and microkinetic modeling. (252, 422, 423) These types of calculations, coupled with parallel experimental efforts, will offer fruitful opportunities for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with desirable activity, selectivity, and stability.
