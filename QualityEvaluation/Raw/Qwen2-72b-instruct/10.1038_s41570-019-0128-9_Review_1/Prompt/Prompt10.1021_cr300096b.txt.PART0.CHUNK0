1.1 Unique Properties of Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
The field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically catalysis on bimetallic alloys, has seen many advances over the past few decades. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts. (1-3) The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications. Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalytic (4) and electrocatalytic (5, 6) applications.
To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews. (7-9) It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. (7, 8, 10-23) The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. However, it is difficult to know a priori how the electronic and chemical properties of a particular bimetallic surface will be modified relative to the parent metals. For this reason, the study of bimetallic surfaces in the field of catalysis has gained considerable interest. There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metalmetal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap. (16) In the past decade there have been significant efforts in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures. Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures. In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties.
1.2 Scope of the Current Review
Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support. The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment. We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis. We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
Because of the enormous volumes of work in bimetallic catalysis, in the current review we will focus on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. The reasons for choosing Pt-based bimetallic systems are primarily 2-fold: (i) they are the most well-studied bimetallic surfaces using both DFT calculations and surface science experiments, and (ii) they are among the most commonly used bimetallic catalysts in both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications. In addition, other bimetallic catalysts without Pt also have interesting properties and important applications. In many cases, the benefits of Pt-free bimetallic alloys are similar to those achieved with Pt. These bimetallic combinations also have similarly modified electronic properties that lead to increased activity and selectivity. (24) For example, AuAg catalysts are active for CO oxidation because the synergistic interaction between the two metals improves the catalytic performance. In this case, Au adsorbs CO molecules and the neighboring Ag adsorbs reactive oxygen species. (25) Non-noble metal bimetallic catalysts are also of interest because of the potential savings in material cost. The NiCu system is one example that has been previously studied for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 to release hydrogen. (26) Although non-Pt-containing systems have important applications, the scope of this review article is limited to Pt-based catalysts to provide a focused and in-depth review of bimetallic catalysis. In section 2 we will utilize one of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, Ni/Pt, to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts. This will be followed in section 3 by DFT calculations and experimental verification of stable bimetallic structures under different reaction conditions. In section 4 we will summarize the unique properties and general trends of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for different types of reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation reactions. The review will conclude by pointing out challenges and research opportunities for further advancing bimetallic catalysis. 2 Preparation and Characterization of Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
2.1 Model Surfaces
2.1.1 Preparation of Bimetallic Surfaces
Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament. Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest. The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system. The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.
Figure 1 Figure 1. Schematic diagram of line-of-sight deposition of metal overlayer by physical vapor deposition with thermal filament.
Procedures for the preparation of bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been described in detail previously. (27, 28) For example, when a 3d transition metal is deposited onto a Pt(111) surface at 300 K, the 3d atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the 3dPtPt(111) surface configuration. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition of the 3d metal occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the 3d atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structure. As shown in Figure 2, monolayer bimetallic surfaces can have three idealized configurations: a surface 3dPtPt(111) configuration, where the metal monolayer grows epitaxially on the surface of the Pt substrate; an intermixed configuration, where the 3d atoms reside in the first two Pt layers to some varying degree; and the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration, where the first layer is composed of Pt atoms and the second layer consists of the 3d atoms. Determination of the structures and elemental compositions of various bimetallic surfaces requires the utilization of a battery of UHV techniques, as described in the next section.

2.1.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Surfaces
Auger Electron Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy The Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) peak-to-peak intensities and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak areas are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces after normalization by the relevant sensitivity factors and consideration of the sampling depth of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. (10) AES and XPS are also useful techniques to determine the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer, either in a layer-by-layer fashion or via 3-dimensional (3D) island formation. In the latter growth mechanism, a uniform monolayer is not formed because the cohesive energy between metal overlayer atoms (MM) is generally higher than the adsorption energy between the metal overlayer and the substrate surface (MS). The layer-by-layer and the 3D island growth mechanisms can often be differentiated by measuring the AES or XPS intensities as a function of deposition time. In the layer-by-layer mechanism, the peak intensity of both the metal overlayer and the substrate show distinct breaks, with the first break indicating the deposition time for the completion of the first monolayer. In contrast, such breaks are absent for the 3D island growth mechanism. (10) Because of the relative ease of these experiments, the AES or XPS growth calibration curves should be measured whenever a new overlayer/substrate system is investigated.
Figure 3 Figure 3. Schematics of surface NiPtPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures derived from AES, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). (28) Low-Energy Ion Scattering Compared with AES and XPS, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) (29) is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces. In LEIS experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne, or Ar, at a relatively low energy (1005000 eV). The incident ions are scattered back with an energy that is directly related to the mass of the surface atom with which they collide. Because the ions have different sensitivities toward atoms of different atomic numbers, the intensity of the scattering peaks needs to be normalized to the intensity of a pure surface of each element. In the case of bimetallic surfaces, the sensitivity factor for the substrate is determined by measuring the intensity of the LEIS signal for a clean substrate surface and that of the thick metal film of interest.
Low-Energy Electron Diffraction Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces. LEED is very useful in identifying the periodicity of the metal overlayer with respect to the single-crystal substrate. (30, 31) For example, LEED studies have helped reveal that bimetallic alloy surfaces, such as Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibit a pure Pt outermost layer with a Pt-depleted layer underneath. (32) LEED measurements are also important to confirm the epitaxial growth of the metal overlayer.
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. In STM experiments a tip is scanned over a sample surface in a regular array, adjusting the height of the tip to keep either the tunneling current or the voltage constant between the STM tip and the surface. The fluctuations of intensity can often be related to differing elements, which is useful in determining the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer as well as the morphology of bimetallic surfaces.
2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. (10) For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments (Figure 3b), which were performed at three different initial coverages. The Ni/Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements. (27, 28) The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in Figure 3d. The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, wormlike features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni atoms in Pt(111). Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later.
In practice, bimetallic catalysts are often supported nanoparticles of varying shape and size. Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated in Figure 4, it is reasonable to assume that the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for a face-centered cubic (fcc) nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extensions. With these assumptions, Menning and Chen deposited Ni on a polycrystalline Pt film that contained mainly the (111) and (100) facets to mimic supported bimetallic particles. (33) Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure. More about the similar catalytic properties between single-crystal PtNiPt(111), polycrystalline PtNiPt, and supported PtNi catalysts will be illustrated later.

(200) In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to characterize the surface structures of several bimetallic systems. Table 1 provides a list of selected bimetallic surfaces, along with the corresponding UHV techniques or theoretical calculations used to characterize the surface properties.

2.2 Supported Catalysts
2.2.1 Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts
Supported bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using a wide range of synthesis techniques. In this section we will provide a summary of some of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods and the potential advantages of each method.
Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation. It involves infusing the desired support material with a solution containing a precursor of the desired metallic species. The support is impregnated with a volume of precursor solution that is equal to the pore volume of the support material. The amount of precursor required is calculated based on the desired metal loading for each catalyst, and the volume of the pores of the support material is measured prior to impregnation using deionized water. (137) To synthesize the catalyst, a known mass of a metal precursor is dissolved in a solvent. Deionized water is the most commonly used solvent for wet impregnation, but research groups have also used Ptacetylacetonates dissolved in toluene to avoid acidification of the support, (138) ethylene glycol, (139) formic acid, (140) and acetone. (141) Catalysts can also be prepared with organometallic bimetallic molecular precursors. These precursors are advantageous to traditional metallic salts because the bimetallic bond is already present, leading to a higher extent of bimetallic bonds and a higher activity of bimetallic catalysts. (142) Once the precursor is fully dissolved, the solution is added dropwise to the support. Capillary action carries the aqueous solution up into the pores of the support, where the metal precursor is deposited. By varying the drying rate of the catalyst, the precursor can deposit deep within the pores or solely at the pore entrances. After drying, the catalyst is calcined at high temperature to vaporize the nonmetallic components of the precursor salt, leaving the metal in an oxidized state on the support surface. Calcination is required to stabilize metals on the support surface and to prevent metal dissolution when exposed to moisture. Incipient wetness impregnation of bimetallic catalysts can be performed sequentially or simultaneously. In sequential impregnation, one metal is impregnated first, and then the catalyst is dried and calcined. After calcination, the second metal is impregnated to complete the catalyst synthesis. Sequential impregnation is preferred in cases where the metal precursors react with each other, but it has been shown that simultaneous impregnation of a bimetallic catalyst yields a greater extent of bimetallic bond formation and higher activity. (143) For example, Lonergan et al. have shown that PtNi catalysts synthesized by simultaneous impregnation were more active for 1,3-butadiene and benzene hydrogenation than catalysts synthesized using sequential impregnation. (143) Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas. The slurry is made with the support material, metal precursor, and water. The amounts of support and precursor are chosen to achieve the desired weight loading of catalyst, and typically 15 mL of deionized water is used for each gram of catalyst. After mixing the components, the slurry is stirred for at least 8 h, during which an equilibrium amount of the precursor should adsorb to the support. (144) During stirring, the pH value is controlled to a set level using NaOH. Once the set stirring time has elapsed, the slurry is filtered and washed and then placed in a drying oven to evaporate the excess water. Catalysts are calcined at high temperatures after drying to stabilize the metal on the support and to remove unwanted elements from the metal precursors. This synthesis method has been used to prepare catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics, which shows that adding a small amount of Pt to an Au/TiO2 catalyst increases the hydrogenation activity by an order of magnitude. (144) Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods. (145) The dispersion of the active phase on the surface of a support is controlled by many factors, including the support type, method of preparation, calcination conditions, precursors, and metal loading. (146) A common problem of impregnation and slurry techniques is the separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support, preventing the effective formation of the bimetallic bonds. An improved method to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then thermally remove the ligands. (147) For example, a bimetallic cluster, [(PPh3)Pt(AuPPh3)6](NO3)2, is used to prepare a PtAu catalyst particle, previously described in detail for different bimetallic precursors. (148) The organometallic cluster is mixed with an organic solvent such as CH2Cl2, and the cluster solution is slowly added to the oxide support with constant swirling. The clusters are spontaneously adsorbed onto the oxide support, and the remaining solvent is decanted. Residual solvent is removed by heating in vacuum, and the clusters are activated by heating in oxygen up to 573 K. Studies have shown that the bimetallic core of the cluster remains intact while the ligands are removed after heating. (145) In probe reactions of ethanol reforming, bimetallic catalysts synthesized with organometallic clusters outperformed catalysts synthesized using traditional impregnation methods. (149) Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. It is an alternative to the organometallic precursor method, which sometimes experiences premature decomposition of the organometallic complex, leading to inactive phases on the catalyst support. (140) In reductive deposition precipitation, a monometallic catalyst, for example, Pt, is prepared by conventional wet impregnation or slurry methods and then held under hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Pt particles react with a second metal precursor, resulting in the formation of a bimetallic surface complex. The surface complex is decomposed in hydrogen, leading to formation of a stabilized bimetallic species. (150) However, this method does not exclusively lead to formation of bimetallic particles, with some of the second metal precursor also depositing on the support. (151) Ekou et al. have shown that PtGe/TiO2 catalysts synthesized using the reductive deposition precipitation method are active for the selective hydrogenation of citral into unsaturated alcohols. (152) Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. This method is used for the synthesis of PtAg bimetallic catalysts. (153) A preprepared Pt catalyst is suspended in deionized water with a second metal source (AgNO3), an ionic strength adjuster (NaNO3), a reducing agent (HCHO), and NaOH or HNO3 to adjust the solution pH. The mixture is stirred for 2 h while the pH is kept at 9 by small additions of NaOH or HNO3. After deposition, the slurry is filtered and washed to remove excess ions, then fully dried. Results indicate that Ag deposition is restricted to the Pt surface and does not readily occur on the catalyst support. (153) For hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB), the addition of Ag to a monometallic Pt catalyst increases the activity by 3 times. The effect of Ag addition is not as pronounced on the catalyst prepared using impregnation, indicating that electroless deposition leads to targeted placement of Ag on the Pt surface. (153) Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles. The metallic colloid is prepared by making a solution of metal precursors, such as K2PtCl4 for Pt, in the presence of a cationic surfactant such as C14TABr. For bimetallic synthesis, precursors of both metals are mixed with the surfactant. The interaction between the precursor metal anions and the surfactant cation in aqueous solution leads to the formation of an organic metal precursor. The reactants are then stirred vigorously and heated to 323 K upon addition of NaBH4, a reducing agent. After reaction, the metallic particles are precipitated and washed in decreasing concentration of ethanol and increasing concentration of water until the particles are filtered and stored. (154) To prepare a supported catalyst, the metallic nanoparticles are added to the desired support in chloroform and sonicated for several hours. The suspension is centrifuged and washed with an acetoneethanol mixture and then dried in an oven. (155) It is important to point out that the removal of carbon from the surfactants and colloids is critical for the utilization of these materials for catalytic applications. In particular, further studies are needed to identify procedures for carbon removal without changing the structure and surface morphology of the catalysts. PtCo catalysts prepared by this method and supported on mesoporous silica have been used for CO2 hydrogenation into CO and CH4 between 473 and 573 K. (155) CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt. The transition metal core is prepared by dissolving a metallic chloride precursor in ethylene glycol with polyvinyl alcohol as a surfactant, while holding the solution under nitrogen. The solution is heated and the metal precursor is reduced by dropwise addition of NaBH4. After reaction, the colloid is quenched on ice, centrifuged in an acetoneethanol mixture, and then dispersed in ethylene glycol. (156) To form the Pt shells, PtCl2 is dissolved in ethylene glycol at room temperature. With a syringe, a small amount of the metallic nanoparticle suspension is added to the PtCl2 solution. The mixture is often heated and held at elevated temperatures before quenching in an ice bath. The supported catalysts are formed by adding an oxide support to the colloidal suspension and drying the slurries in vacuum. Pt@Ru coreshell nanoparticles synthesized with this method were shown to be more active than their constituent pure metal nanoparticles, as well as their nanoalloys synthesized from conventional methods for CO oxidation in hydrogen. (156) For coreshell systems, it is also desirable to synthesize catalysts with a low-cost transition metal core and Pt or other precious metals at the outermost layer. Mayrhofer et al. have found that, in PtCo@Pt coreshell nanoparticles, Pt segregates to the surface under a CO environment. (157) Another study with a M@Pt (M = Ni, Co) system shows high activity for hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). (158) Fe@Pt NPs supported on carbon have also been used for NH3BH3 oxidation. These catalysts are low cost, highly stable, and much more active than the commercial Pt/C catalysts used for NH3BH3 oxidation. (159) Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The microemulsion is formed by dissolving a small amount of a metal precursor in an aqueous environment inside of a nonionic surfactant. Upon addition of a reducing agent, such as hydrazine (N2H4), the metal precursors are chemically reduced, leaving nanosized metallic particles. (160) Synthesis of supported catalysts begins by mixing an aqueous solution with the metal precursor and surfactant with an oil-phase solution of the reducing agent. Under stirring, the solution becomes clear, indicating the formation of reverse micelles. A metal oxide support is added as the solution is titrated with acetone to disrupt the micelles, leading to the adsorption of micelles to the support. (161) Reverse micelle synthesis is a useful technique because the size of the metallic nanoparticles can be directly controlled by the ratio of water to surfactant. The amount of reducing agent can also influence the size of particles by increasing the nucleation rate and, thus, decreasing the particle size. (160) PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts synthesized using this method exhibit increased activity over their parent metals for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation due to an enhanced bimetallic effect. (162) Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm. This synthesis method overcomes the weakness of traditional impregnation techniques, which tend to make nanoparticles with wide size distributions. (163) Dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) are synthesized by extracting metal ions into the interior of dendrimers and then chemically reducing the metal ions to form monodisperse particles that are <3 nm in diameter. (164) DENs are prepared by adding a low concentration of K2PtCl4, or another metallic precursor, to an aqueous solution of hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers. The generation (size) of the dendrimers can be used to directly control the size of the metallic nanoparticles. After adding the metal precursor to the dendrimer solution and stirring for 3 days, the solution is purged with N2 and then chemically reduced with NaBH4 overnight. The metallic nanoparticles are removed by dialysis and then filtered. (165) Once the solution of metallic nanoparticles is obtained, the particles can be deposited on a support by impregnation. Catalysts synthesized with dendrimer supports have been tested in several catalytic applications including hydrogenation (164) and CO oxidation. (163) Other Synthesis Methods Several other synthesis techniques have been employed to synthesize supported catalysts. Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds. This shortens the crystallization period of the metal nanoparticles, leading to more homogeneous nucleation when compared to traditional synthesis methods. In MAPR synthesis, the support is immersed in an aqueous metal precursor solution and then dried in vacuum. (166) The MAPR method can be applied to bimetallic catalysts by adding a second metal precursor to the aqueous solution. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been successfully synthesized using the MAPR method with high activity and selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, with the MAPR catalysts outperforming catalysts synthesized by the conventional impregnation method. (166) Another interesting approach is to directly deposit metal on an oxide support on the reactor wall. The reactor consists of an FeCrAl cylinder placed in a stainless steel tube, which is heated to high temperatures to produce a γ-Al2O3 film on the surface of the cylinder. (167) To prepare the supported catalyst, the FeCrAl alloy cylinder is dipped into a slurry of metallic precursors until the desired loading is reached, followed by drying and calcining the alloy cylinder. (167) The advantage of this synthesis process is that the catalyst is formed directly on the walls of the reactor, allowing for high loading and potentially uniform catalyst deposition. This approach has been used for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich gas streams, leading to a reduction of CO in the feed from 1% to <10 ppm. (167) Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition. In the laser-vaporization technique, a low-energy Nd:YAG pulsed laser vaporizes a metal of interest from a rod to create a plasma. Crystal growth begins by introducing a continuous flow of He or Ar into the evaporation chamber, leading to the deposition of metal clusters onto the catalyst support. These clusters are highly uniform in size and composition as they are fully formed before they are deposited onto the support. (168) Although the quantity of the catalysts produced in this method is relatively small, these samples offer the opportunity for obtaining fundamental correlations between catalytic properties and the size, shape, and composition of bimetallic catalysts. PtPd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by laser vaporization show similar trends as catalysts prepared by traditional methods for toluene hydrogenation. (168)
2.2.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Catalysts
CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification. The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.
Elemental Analysis Two techniques are commonly used to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state. In a typical AAS experiment, an analyte solution is prepared by dissolving a supported catalyst, which is then made into an aerosol with a nebulizer and atomized using an airacetylene flame. The concentration of metallic ions in the solution is obtained after normalizing the AAS intensity with reference compounds. (169) Another technique, inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES), is also used to quantify the concentration of trace metals within a bimetallic catalyst. (170) In principle, ICP-AES/OES should have a higher detection limit than AAS for most metals, although it is a more sophisticated and expensive instrument than AAS.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst. After calcination, a catalyst is placed in a reactor under flowing H2 and heated at a constant ramp rate. As the temperature increases, the catalyst is reduced by the H2 and oxygen is removed from the catalyst in the form of water. With a TCD connected to the effluent stream, the change in concentration of water can be measured to determine the reduction temperature(s). The TPR measurements provide information on the optimal reduction temperature for a catalyst, as well as whether the presence of Pt reduces the reduction temperature of bimetallic catalysts. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) is similar in theory to TPR, but it is used to measure the amount of coke deposited on the surface of a catalyst. In TPO measurements, a spent catalyst is placed in a reactor under flowing O2 and heated at a constant rate. As the temperature increases, the coke on the surface of the catalyst is oxidized by O2 and the carbon is removed from the catalyst in the form of CO2. Using a TCD to monitor the composition of the effluent stream, the area of the CO2 intensity versus temperature curve can be measured to determine the amount of surface carbon. This technique can also be used to determine the strength of interaction between the surface carbon and the supported catalyst because a higher oxidation temperature indicates the coke is more difficult to remove. A related technique, thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA), is also used sometimes to determine the amount of surface carbon through precise weight measurements during TPO of spent catalysts. (171, 172) Temperature-Programmed Desorption Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) is used to determine the binding energy of adsorbates on catalysts. In TPD experiments a catalyst is loaded into a reactor fitted with a mass spectrometer. The catalyst can be pretreated under reduction conditions or used in the calcined form. After pretreatment, the catalyst is treated with an adsorbate, which is usually a reactant of interest. The excess adsorbate that is not strongly bound to the catalyst is removed by flowing He. The catalyst is heated linearly at a constant rate, (139) and the effluent products are monitored using a mass spectrometer. By plotting the evolution of the adorbate and its derivatives versus temperature, information can be inferred regarding reaction sites and binding energies of the adsorbate.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts. TEM uses transmission of a high-energy electron beam (200 keV) through a thin sample to produce an image, whereas SEM rasters a high-energy electron beam (140 keV) across the surface of a sample. In TEM, two primary imaging modes are used to investigate particle size and morphology of catalysts. Imaging can be performed in either bright field (BF) or dark field (DF) modes by selecting the direct beam (transmitted through the sample) or diffracted beam (diffracted off of the sample), respectively. BF imaging is used mainly to view catalyst morphology because the contrast between the metal and the support is too low to accurately quantify metallic particle sizes on supported catalysts. DF imaging has much more utility for viewing high atomic number (Z) transition metals supported on low-Z metal oxides. When combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), catalysts can be imaged with very high Z-contrast in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging. In HAADF imaging, the STEM probe is a focused beam that is rastered across an area of the sample. As the atomic number of the element increases, the scattering angle of the electrons also increases. Therefore, HAADF imaging easily distinguishes between different elements by Z-contrast to create a high-contrast image. (173) Unlike TEM, electrons in SEM are not transmitted through the sample. The most common mode of image capture in SEM is by secondary electrons. An image constructed with secondary electrons contains rich topographic information and has a 3D appearance. SEM is particularly useful for characterizing the morphology and topography of catalyst surfaces. Because the morphology of the catalysts often changes under reaction conditions, further development and applications of environmental TEM and SEM should provide additional means for catalyst characterization.
Recently, there have been advances to correct intrinsic imperfections in the lenses of electron microscopes to improve resolution at very high magnification. These microscopes contain additional lenses to correct for spherical and chromatic aberrations. Spherical aberration corrected TEM (CS-TEM) is capable of distinguishing features up to 0.1 nm for the viewing of individual metal atoms. This technique has been used recently to correlate strain effects in PtFe@Pt nanoparticles to activity in the oxygen reduction reaction. (174) In addition to increasing the resolution of TEM, advances have been made in performing TEM under in situ conditions, referred to as environmental TEM (E-TEM). E-TEM has been used to study the behavior of Cu/CeO2 catalysts under reduction and oxidation conditions for several reactions including the water gas shift reaction, methanol synthesis, and methanol reforming. (175) The chemical composition of a catalyst can be measured using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in both TEM and SEM. EDS relies on the principle of X-ray fluorescence to collect compositional data in specific areas of the sample. A fluorescent X-ray is created from atoms that are ionized by the incident electron beam. (176) The fluorescent X-ray has a characteristic energy that is equal to the difference of energy of the outer-shell and inner-shell electrons for a specific element. The peak intensities in EDS measurements can be used to estimate the elemental compositions of the sampled area after proper normalization.
Infrared Spectroscopy Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates adsorbed on catalysts, as well as to measure the concentrations of reactants and products in the gas or aqueous phase. Several types of IR spectroscopy are used in catalytic research. The most common one is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, (177, 178) which is used to measure the transmission of infrared radiation through a catalyst pellet or reaction environment. The IR cell is a gas-phase batch reactor that allows the heating and in situ reduction of the catalyst pellet. The rate constant and product distribution can be obtained by measuring gas-phase FTIR as a function of reaction time. In addition, FTIR measurements are often useful in determining the surface termination of bimetallic particles by measuring the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO). Because the frequencies of adsorbed CO are distinct for different transition metals, a comparison of FTIR spectra between the bimetallic and monometallic catalysts reveals which metals occupy the topmost surfaces of the bimetallic particles. As will be demonstrated later, the surface termination of bimetallic catalysts plays a critical role in the catalytic performance. Two other types of IR spectroscopy are also used in catalyst characterization. Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) measures the attenuation of total internal reflection of the reflected light (179) and is better suited for aqueous-phase environments. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measures the reflection of the IR light from the catalyst, making it more surface-sensitive than transmission FTIR. In addition, a related optical technique, ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS), is a surface-sensitive spectroscopy that is identical in theory to DRIFTS but uses wavelengths of light in the UVvis range instead of in the IR range. The higher-energy radiation allows UVvis DRS to probe the band gap of metals to obtain information regarding the oxidation state. (180) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures (181, 182) of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions. XAS measurements are performed by using a monochromatic X-ray beam and collecting the absorption coefficient, μ, as a function of X-ray energy. When the incident energy (hυ) approaches the binding energy Eo of a core level electron, a sharp jump in μ is observed, known as the absorption edge. The region of the scan that begins before the absorption edge and ranges to 50100 eV above the edge is known as the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region. (183, 184) The region beginning at 50100 eV above the edge (after the XANES region) and extending up to 1000 eV past the edge is known as the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region. (183) A critical feature in the XANES region is the white line, caused by a rapid increase in absorption. This feature is present in L-edges, due to the excitation of an electron from the p-orbitals into the higher energy, unoccupied d-states. (185) The main utility of the white line is to characterize the oxidation state of a metal during and after H2 treatment, as well as during catalytic reactions. For example, a reduction in the white line intensity after treatment in H2 indicates that the metal of interest is being reduced. With further analysis of the XANES region, information regarding coordination number can also be calculated. (181, 182) The EXAFS region contains fine-structure information regarding the local coordination environment. The critical difference between the EXAFS and XANES regions is that in the EXAFS region the ejected photoelectron has sufficient energy to scatter from each of the surrounding atoms and then backscatter to the absorbing atom. (181) Because the ejected photoelectron has wave-particle duality, the outgoing and backscattered electrons can constructively or destructively interfere with each other, making it possible to derive information about the local coordination environment of the catalyst particle. For example, the intensity of the oscillations increases with increasing coordination number, while the frequency of oscillations is inversely dependent on interatomic distances. (182) Quantitative structural information can be obtained after data reduction and mathematical analysis of the EXAFS function, as described elsewhere. (183, 186, 187) Quantitative analysis of EXAFS results are obtained by fitting the reduced data to phases and backscattering amplitudes constructed either from reference compounds or calculations using simulation software such as FEFF. (187-189) Additional information can be obtained by combining XAS with other techniques for in situ, time-resolved measurements. For example, combined XAS and XRD measurements are applied for investigations of catalysts under reaction conditions. (190) Several authors have further enhanced the combined measurements by adding complementary electronic and vibrational spectroscopy techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UVvis), infrared, and Raman, to the well-established XASXRD combination. (191, 192) Weckhuysen and others have combined the small- and wide-angle scattering (SAXS and WAXS) techniques with quick-scanning XAS to study in situ processes. (193) More details about some of these advances can be found in a recent review by Bentrup. (194)
2.2.3 Example: Characterization of Supported PtNi Bimetallic Catalysts
Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using various synthesis methods and characterized with many of the techniques described previously. For example, Figure 5 shows the proposed bimetallic particle in PtNi/γ-Al2O3 after in situ reduction in H2. (143) The particle size was determined from a combination of TEM and CO chemisorption analysis. The Pt-termination of the catalyst particle was derived by comparing the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on PtNi/γ-Al2O3 and the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The presence of fully reduced, metallic Pt and Ni was confirmed following the reduction of white line intensities in XANES during H2 reduction. The intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms was verified by the detection of the PtNi nearest neighbor in the EXAFS measurements. Overall, the Pt-terminated bimetallic particle in Figure 5 is similar to the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure in Figure 3, responsible for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, as discussed later.
Figure 5 Figure 5. Proposed structure of a supported PtNi bimetallic particle derived from TEM, FTIR, and EXAFS characterization. 3 Stability of Pt-Based Bimetallic Surfaces with Different Adsorbates
3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties. For example, as shown earlier in Figure 3, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPtPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e., without adsorbates. Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces.
Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum. Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components. Ruban et al. (198) have performed DFT calculations of the values of Eseg for admetal atoms (M) on many host substrates (H), utilizing the linear-muffintin-orbitals coherent potential approximation. If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure. Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition.
Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures. It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. Because hydrogen binds relatively weakly to most transition metals, only a few bimetallic surfaces experience a hydrogen-induced segregation of the subsurface admetals.
Besides hydrogen, it is also important to study the influence of adsorbates on surface segregation using a strong adsorbate, such as oxygen. Figure 6 shows the total energy difference, ΔEseg, defined as the difference between the formation energy of the subsurface and surface structures, as a function of the surface d-band center in the 3dPtPt(111) structure. The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum. For comparison, the ΔEseg values are also included in Figure 6 with 0.5 ML atomic hydrogen and oxygen. (33) The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface. Additional atomic adsorbates are studied by Menning and Chen (200) to compare how the thermodynamic potential for segregation varies with adsorbate binding strength. An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations. When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum. (200) Figure 6 Figure 6. DFT calculations of thermodynamic stability of 3d/Pt(111) surfaces in vacuum and with 0.5 ML of atomic hydrogen and oxygen. Positive ΔEseg values indicate that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures are thermodynamically stable. (33, 200) The results in Figure 6 indicate that the presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt3dPt(111). Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same. (33) The oxygen-induced surface segregation is also predicted for the (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys by Callejas-Tovar and Balbuena. (201) Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates.

3.2 Experimental Verification of Surface Segregation
DFT results predict that the surface 3dPtPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. Parallel experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation. To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(NiO) and ν(CoO) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures. In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface PtNiPt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7  1 and 15  2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier.
Figure 7 Figure 7. (a) Normalized Ni/Pt Auger ratio as a function of oxygen exposure at various temperatures and (b) Arrhenius analysis of the activation barrier from PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111) in oxygen environment. (64) To capture the effect of the crystal facet on segregation, oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Co and Ni has also been studied on polycrystalline Pt foil composed of nearly equal amounts of the two main crystal facets for fcc, (111) and (100). (33) Using a similar Arrhenius analysis procedure, an activation barrier is estimated to be 27  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Ni from the Pt(100) facet of the Pt foil, higher than the value of 15  2 kcal/mol from Pt(111). This trend is consistent with the DFT prediction that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet. (33) Experiments such as those shown in Figure 7 are extremely time-consuming to perform. Through the use of combined theory and experiments, an estimation for the activation barriers of other Pt3dPt systems can be achieved using a BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship. (33) The constants in the BEP relationship have been derived from the activation barriers for the PtNiPt(111), PtNiPt(100), and PtCoPt(111) surfaces. The results from this prediction are shown in Figure 8, where the left axis is the segregation energy and the right axis is scaled to show the corresponding BEP activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation. All of the Pt3dPt(100) structures are predicted to have a higher activation barrier for oxygen-induced segregation compared to the respective Pt3dPt(111) configuration. Among Pt3d bimetallic surfaces, the PtNiPt system is predicted to be the most resistant to oxygen-induced segregation, having the highest activation barriers for the (111) and (100) crystal facets. At the other extreme, the PtTiPt surface is predicted to be the most susceptible to oxygen-induced segregation, having the lowest (100) activation barrier and an unactivated process on the (111) crystal facet.
Figure 8 Figure 8. Left axis shows the DFT-predicted potential energy difference for segregation of Pt3d systems with 0.5 ML O, and the right axis shows activation barriers derived using a BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship. (33) In addition to segregation experiments performed under UHV conditions, the segregation of subsurface Co and Ni was also verified under ambient pressure using XANES (226) under in situ conditions. Using a polycrystalline Pt foil as the substrate, the Co and Ni atoms were found to undergo inward diffusion upon exposure to H2 and surface segregation after exposure to O2. These experimental observations further confirm the DFT prediction (Figure 6) that the Pt-terminated subsurface structure is stable with adsorbed hydrogen while the 3d-terminated surface structure is preferred with adsorbed oxygen.
Furthermore, such reversible behavior is extended to bimetallic nanoparticles. Mu et al. (209) have observed the reversible structural changes at the surfaces of supported PtNi nanoparticles treated in alternating O2 and H2 atmospheres. Figure 9 shows the XPS Ni/Pt intensity ratio, which oscillates with the oxidationreduction cycles. The XPS results indicate that the PtNi nanoparticles surface is NiO-rich in oxidizing gases and Pt-terminated in reducing gases, consistent with the DFT predictions in Figure 6. Overall, the strong correlation between DFT prediction and experimental measurements, on both model surfaces and nanoparticles, provides conclusive evidence that the bimetallic structures change under different reaction environments. Such structural changes in turn modify the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts for different types of reactions, such as hydrogenation and oxidation reactions, as discussed in the next section.

Table 3 summarizes selected UHV studies of the adsorption and reaction of different molecules on model bimetallic surfaces. Tables summarizing reactor studies over supported bimetallic catalysts based on the types of reactions are provided in the corresponding subsections. The main focus of the review is to identify general trends on how bimetallic catalysts enhance the activity and selectivity for each type of reaction.

4.1 Hydrogenation Reactions
Catalytic hydrogenations are among the most commonly practiced catalytic processes, ranging from common steps in organic synthesis to batch processes in pharmaceutical production, to stabilization of edible oils, and to petroleum upgrading processes. Because hydrogenation reactions are typically exothermic, it is advantageous to carry out these reactions at low temperatures. In the current section we will first use the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing the low-temperature hydrogenation activity by reducing the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene, which can be achieved by designing bimetallic surfaces with specific surface structures. We will then discuss hydrogenation reactions of CC, CO, and NO bonds to further illustrate the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in terms of both hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Hydrogenation studies under UHV conditions are summarized in Table 3; selected reactor studies of hydrogenation reactions over supported bimetallic catalysts are listed in Table 4 Table 4.

4.1.1 CC Hydrogenation
4.1.1.1 Example: Cyclohexene Hydrogenation on Pt3d Catalysts
Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry. Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity.
DFT and UHV Studies on Single-Crystal 3d/Pt(111) Surfaces To facilitate the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene, one hypothesis is that an effective catalyst should bond relatively weakly to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene. Hammer and Nrskov (302) have shown that the binding strength of molecules on transition metals is dependent on the electronic structure of the surface, by using the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level to describe the surface electronic property. Chen et al. (10) have summarized experimental and theoretical studies that identify a nearly linear relationship between the binding energies and the surface d-band center for many adsorbates on a wide range of bimetallic surfaces.
DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 10a, (27) HBE is related to the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, in agreement with the trend observed in previous studies for other surfaces. (10) In general, the addition of a 3d metal surface layer on Pt(111) moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level compared to that of the bulk 3d metals. This is primarily due to the tensile strain induced by the Pt lattice because the ligand effect is weakest between late transition metal overlayers and the Pt(111) substrate. (16) Conversely, the presence of subsurface 3d metals shifts the surface d-band center of Pt away from the Fermi level as compared to that of Pt(111), mainly due to the electronic interaction of Pt and the subsurface 3d atoms. (16) The comparison in Figure 10a demonstrates that HBE typically follows the trend of 3dPtPt(111) > Pt(111) > Pt3dPt(111). In addition, the nearly linear correlation between HBE and the surface d-band center should enable one to predict HBE on other bimetallic catalysts based on the extensive database of d-band center values for many bimetallic surfaces.
