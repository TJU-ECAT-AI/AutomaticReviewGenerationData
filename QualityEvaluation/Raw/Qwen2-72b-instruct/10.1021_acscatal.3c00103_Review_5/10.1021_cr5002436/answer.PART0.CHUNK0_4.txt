[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[3] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[5] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[6] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[9] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[11] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[12] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

1.The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are influenced by market demand, feedstock availability, and thermodynamic limitations. The steady increase in demand for chemical building blocks, such as propylene, has led to a positive growth in demand and production in major markets, except for the Eurozone, which was affected by a recent economic downturn. The improvement in hydraulic fracturing technologies has enabled cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas, leading to a significant drop in gas costs and making shale gas attractive as a feedstock for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals. The high availability of cheap natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has shifted the focus from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States. Steam cracking of ethane produces primarily ethylene, leading to a drop in propylene supply and a sharp rise in its price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH. The profitability of PDH is influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable. Dehydrogenation technologies offer the advantage of producing a specific olefin rather than a mixture of products, and industrial processes are optimized to produce polymer-quality olefins. Currently, around 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually by PDH, but this number is expected to increase significantly with the construction of new PDH installations worldwide. A similar market situation exists for the dehydrogenation of butanes, driven by increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in higher butadiene prices and investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战和机遇受到市场需求、原料供应和热力学限制的影响。化学建筑块如丙烯等的需求稳步增长，导致主要市场的需求和生产在近年来呈现正增长，除了受到最近经济衰退影响的欧元区。水力压裂技术的改进使得能够以成本效益的方式提取大量页岩气，导致天然气成本相对于2005年价格下降约75%，使页岩气作为生产运输燃料和化学品的原料变得非常有吸引力。廉价的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置。相对于石脑油裂解，乙烷蒸汽裂解主要产生乙烯，导致丙烯供应下降，价格急剧上涨，为像PDH这样的目标催化技术创造了机会。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的优势在于它专门生产特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品，工业过程被优化以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。目前，每年通过PDH生产约500万吨丙烯，但随着全球新PDH装置的建设，这一数字预计会显著增加。对于丁烷的脱氢，存在类似有利的市场情况，因为同样的条件适用。特别是来自汽车行业的需求增加，加上由于石脑油裂解的高成本导致的供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。这反过来又刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢(BDH)装置的投资。
