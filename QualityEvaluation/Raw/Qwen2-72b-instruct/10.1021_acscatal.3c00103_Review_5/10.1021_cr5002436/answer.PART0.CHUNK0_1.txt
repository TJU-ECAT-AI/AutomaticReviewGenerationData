[1] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
[2] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[3] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[4] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[5] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[6] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[7] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[8] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing new catalyst materials and optimizing existing ones to improve their performance under high-temperature conditions. The market conditions are very favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene, leading to dozens of new PDH installations being announced worldwide. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that they yield a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. There is also a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, with increased demand from the automotive industry and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括在考虑热力学限制的情况下，需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂。研究人员通过开发新的催化剂材料和优化现有材料来提高其在高温条件下的性能，以应对这些需求。由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，PDH的市场条件非常有利，这导致全球宣布了数十个新的PDH装置。脱氢技术的另一个优势是它们产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品。对于丁烷的脱氢，也有类似有利的市场情况，由于汽车行业的高需求和由于高成本的裂解汽油导致的供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨，从而刺激了美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢装置的投资。
