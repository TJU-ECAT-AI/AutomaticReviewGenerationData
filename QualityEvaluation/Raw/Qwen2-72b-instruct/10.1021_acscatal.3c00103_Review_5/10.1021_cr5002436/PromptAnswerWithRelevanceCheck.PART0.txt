[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

1.在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂，同时考虑到热力学限制。研究人员正在通过开发替代催化剂，如金属氧化物，来解决这些需求，这些催化剂已经获得了大量关注，但尚未提供PtSn和CrOx系统的实际替代方案。这些替代配方往往由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复其活性而过快失活。需要进一步的进展来降低贵金属负载，提高催化剂稳定性，并提高脱氢过程的能源效率。此外，必须制定策略来克服有限的平衡转化率和高温下副反应的普遍性。

[1] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
[2] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[3] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[4] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[7] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[8] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[9] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[10] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[11] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[12] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East."

[3] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[5] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

[6] "It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings. Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

[7] "However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."

1.The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are influenced by market demand, feedstock availability, and thermodynamic limitations. The steady increase in demand for chemical building blocks, such as propylene, has led to a positive growth in demand and production in major markets, except for the Eurozone, which was affected by a recent economic downturn. The improvement in hydraulic fracturing technologies has enabled cost-effective extraction of large volumes of shale gas, leading to a significant drop in gas costs and making shale gas attractive as a feedstock for the production of transportation fuels and chemicals. The high availability of cheap natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, has shifted the focus from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States. Steam cracking of ethane produces primarily ethylene, leading to a drop in propylene supply and a sharp rise in its price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH. The profitability of PDH is influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable. Dehydrogenation technologies offer the advantage of producing a specific olefin rather than a mixture of products, and industrial processes are optimized to produce polymer-quality olefins. Currently, around 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually by PDH, but this number is expected to increase significantly with the construction of new PDH installations worldwide. A similar market situation exists for the dehydrogenation of butanes, driven by increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in higher butadiene prices and investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战和机遇受到市场需求、原料供应和热力学限制的影响。化学建筑块如丙烯等的需求稳步增长，导致主要市场的需求和生产在近年来呈现正增长，除了受到最近经济衰退影响的欧元区。水力压裂技术的改进使得能够以成本效益的方式提取大量页岩气，导致天然气成本相对于2005年价格下降约75%，使页岩气作为生产运输燃料和化学品的原料变得非常有吸引力。廉价的天然气液体，特别是乙烷的高可用性，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷用于蒸汽裂解装置。相对于石脑油裂解，乙烷蒸汽裂解主要产生乙烯，导致丙烯供应下降，价格急剧上涨，为像PDH这样的目标催化技术创造了机会。PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，这使得当前的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的优势在于它专门生产特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品，工业过程被优化以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。目前，每年通过PDH生产约500万吨丙烯，但随着全球新PDH装置的建设，这一数字预计会显著增加。对于丁烷的脱氢，存在类似有利的市场情况，因为同样的条件适用。特别是来自汽车行业的需求增加，加上由于石脑油裂解的高成本导致的供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。这反过来又刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢(BDH)装置的投资。
