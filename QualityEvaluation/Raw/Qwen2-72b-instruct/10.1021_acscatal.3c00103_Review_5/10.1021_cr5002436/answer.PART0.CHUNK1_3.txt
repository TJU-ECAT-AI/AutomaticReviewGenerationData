[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, which have received significant attention but have not yet provided a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternative formulations often deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, strategies are being explored to overcome the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures.

1.在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂，同时考虑到热力学限制。研究人员正在通过开发替代催化剂，如金属氧化物，来解决这些需求，这些催化剂已经受到了广泛关注，但尚未提供PtSn和CrOx系统的可行替代方案。这些替代配方往往由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复其活性而过快失活。需要进一步的进展来降低贵金属负载，提高催化剂稳定性，并提高脱氢过程的能源效率。此外，正在探索策略以克服在高温下有限的平衡转化率和副反应的普遍性。
