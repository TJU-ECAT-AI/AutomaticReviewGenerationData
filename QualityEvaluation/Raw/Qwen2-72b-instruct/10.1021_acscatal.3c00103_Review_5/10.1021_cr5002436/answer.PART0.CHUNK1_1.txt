[1] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."
[2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the rapid deactivation of alternative catalyst formulations due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Researchers are addressing these issues by seeking to improve catalyst stability, lower noble metal loading, and enhance energy efficiency. Additionally, efforts are focused on overcoming the thermodynamic limitations of the reaction, which restrict equilibrium conversion, and minimizing side reactions that occur at high temperatures.
