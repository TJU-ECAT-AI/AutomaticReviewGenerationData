[1] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
[2] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
[3] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
[4] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
[5] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[6] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
[7] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the thermodynamic limitations that decrease alkene selectivity with increasing temperature and chain length due to increased dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Despite extensive research on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) over two decades, there are still gaps between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy between the endothermic dehydrogenation step and exothermic hydrogen combustion, as well as the design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Researchers are focusing on gaining insights into CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation, aiming to rationally design new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Propane dehydrogenation is a particular focus due to the need for alternative technologies for propene production.

1.在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括热力学限制，随着温度和链长的增加，烷烃选择性降低，这是由于脱氢环化/芳构化、热裂解和焦炭形成倾向增加所致。尽管在氧化脱氢(ODH)方面进行了超过二十年的广泛研究，但实验室成果与工业实施之间仍然存在差距。商业ODH技术需要创新的催化剂和工艺设计，包括内热脱氢步骤与外热氢燃烧之间的适当协同作用，以及选择性CH和氢燃烧催化剂的设计。研究人员正专注于深入了解CH活化和烷烃脱氢的反应途径，旨在合理设计新的高效催化剂，用于较低烷烃的脱氢。由于需要替代技术来生产丙烯，丙烷脱氢是特别关注的焦点。
