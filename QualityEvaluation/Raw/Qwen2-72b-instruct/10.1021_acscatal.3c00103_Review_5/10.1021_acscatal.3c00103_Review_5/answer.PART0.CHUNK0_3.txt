1.The primary challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production include the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts due to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding resistance to sintering and coke formation. However, there are issues with the use of excessive metal promoters in metal-based catalysts, making them uneconomical. The hydroxyl anchoring method is effective for anchoring active sites, but the current methods for fabricating supports with uniform organic groups are complicated and expensive. Encapsulation is a promising strategy for size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation, but the selection of proper ligands and the use of expensive raw materials limit its application. Utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can decrease diffusion restriction, but the use of rare templates hinders industrial application.

1.工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括由于烧结和焦炭沉积导致的异质催化剂失活。研究人员通过引入助剂、封装、羟基锚定和支持物改性等策略来构建具有出色抗烧结和抗焦炭能力的高性能催化剂，以应对这些挑战。然而，金属基催化剂中使用过量的金属助剂来构建和维持稳定的金属间化合物或合金，使这些催化剂变得不经济。羟基锚定方法可以有效地锚定活性位点，但目前用于制备具有均匀有机基团的支持物的方法复杂且成本高昂。封装是构建稳定PDH催化剂的热门话题，因为它在尺寸控制、位点调整和空间分割方面具有优势，但选择合适的配体和使用昂贵的原材料限制了其应用。对于传统的微孔沸石和金属氧化物支持物，利用具有大外表面的不同形态的支持物可以有效地减少异质催化系统中的扩散限制，但使用稀有模板阻碍了工业应用。
