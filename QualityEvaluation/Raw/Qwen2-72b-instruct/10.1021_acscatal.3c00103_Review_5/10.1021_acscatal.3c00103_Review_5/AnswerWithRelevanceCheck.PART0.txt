          [1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity in catalysts, while managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures are preferred for high propane conversion, but they can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies such as introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to create high-performance catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to sintering and coke formation. However, these strategies face issues such as the uneconomical use of excessive metal promoters, complex and expensive processes for hydroxyl anchoring, and the need for proper ligands in encapsulation techniques. Additionally, the use of rare templates in preparing supports with large outer surfaces for diffusion restriction is a hindrance to industrial application.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括在催化剂中需要高温稳定性和丙烯选择性，同时管理热力学限制和副反应。为了实现高丙烷转化率，需要高温，但高温会导致副反应和催化剂失活，因为会发生烧结和焦炭沉积。研究人员正在通过开发策略来应对这些挑战，例如引入促进剂、封装、羟基锚定和支持修改，以创建具有增强稳定性和抵抗烧结和焦炭形成的高性能催化剂。然而，这些策略面临的问题包括过度使用金属促进剂的不经济性，用于羟基锚定的复杂和昂贵过程，以及封装技术中需要适当的配体。此外，使用稀有模板来制备具有大外表面的支持物以限制扩散，这阻碍了工业应用。
