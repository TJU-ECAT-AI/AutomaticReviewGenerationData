[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
[2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
[3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
[4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites. At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
[5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
[6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."

1.The primary challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production include the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts due to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to build high-performance catalysts with resistance to sintering and coke formation. However, there are issues with the use of excessive metal promoters, the complexity and cost of hydroxyl anchoring and encapsulation methods, and the need for support modifications that can decrease diffusion restrictions while maintaining hydrothermal stability and repeatability.
