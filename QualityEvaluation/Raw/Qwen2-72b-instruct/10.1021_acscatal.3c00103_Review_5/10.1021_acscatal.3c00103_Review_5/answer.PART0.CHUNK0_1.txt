[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
[2] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
[3] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
[4] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
[5] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
[6] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
[7] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
[8] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key technique for industrial propylene production, with high temperatures preferred for high propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitations. However, high temperatures can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation, primarily through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies such as introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to create high-performance catalysts with resistance to sintering and coke formation. Specific areas of focus include understanding promoter effects, improving hydroxyl anchoring methods, optimizing encapsulation techniques, and utilizing hierarchical zeolites as supports to enhance catalytic performance and stability.
