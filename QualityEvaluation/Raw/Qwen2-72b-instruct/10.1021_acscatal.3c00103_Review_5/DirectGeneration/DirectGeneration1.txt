The development of high-performance catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in industrial propylene production is a critical area of research, driven by the increasing demand for propylene as a key petrochemical feedstock. PDH catalysts face significant challenges, primarily related to high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity. High temperatures are necessary to achieve the desired conversion rates, but they also lead to catalyst deactivation and sintering, reducing the catalyst's lifespan and efficiency. Moreover, achieving high propylene selectivity while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts such as coke and carbon monoxide is a major hurdle. Ongoing research in this field is exploring various strategies to address these issues. One approach involves the development of bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts that can enhance both stability and selectivity by optimizing the active sites' electronic properties. Another focus is on understanding the fundamental thermodynamic limitations of PDH, which can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Researchers are also investigating the use of advanced materials such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that offer tunable porosity and acidity, which can improve the diffusion of reactants and products and enhance selectivity. These efforts not only aim to improve the economics of propylene production but also to reduce the environmental impact by minimizing energy consumption and waste generation.
