[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
[2] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
[3] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
[4] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
[5] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
[6] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
[7] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the efficient adsorption and activation of propane, as well as the desorption of propylene on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. The reaction is highly endothermic, and thermodynamics favor higher temperatures and lower pressures for increased propane conversion. However, this also increases the rates of side reactions, necessitating the regulation of reaction conditions and kinetics to improve propylene selectivity and productivity. The development of stable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly catalysts is crucial, particularly in light of the limitations of current Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content, developing low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts through special preparation methods, and investigating new strategies to improve catalyst stability and find alternative catalysts.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括在异质催化剂表面有效吸附和活化丙烷，以及随后脱附丙烯。该反应高度吸热，且是一个气体分子数增加的过程，这意味着提高反应温度和/或降低分压有利于提高丙烷的转化率，正如热力学分析所示。然而，这也会增加副反应的速率，因此需要调节反应条件和反应动力学，以抑制副反应，提高丙烯的选择性和产量。开发稳定、低成本和环境友好的催化剂至关重要，特别是在考虑到当前Pt基和CrOx基催化剂的局限性的情况下。研究人员正在通过探索低或非铬含量的替代金属氧化物催化剂、通过特殊制备方法开发低Pt含量和稳定的Pt基催化剂，以及研究新的策略来提高催化剂稳定性和寻找替代催化剂来应对这些需求。
