[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
[2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
[3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
[4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
[6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
[7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
[8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
[9] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
[10] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
[11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
[12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
[13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
[14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
[15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
[17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
[18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
[19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
[20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
[21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
[22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
[23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
[24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
[25] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
[27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
[28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
[29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need to inhibit overoxidation of propylene to COx in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and the complexity of identifying active sites and reaction mechanisms. Opportunities include the potential of ODH to improve reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics, the development of alternative catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with high olefin selectivity, and the exploration of chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH to promote propane transformation.
2.Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions by developing novel methods for catalyst preparation, such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation. They are also focusing on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single-site Pt for PDH, aiming to develop thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts. Additionally, researchers are investigating alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, although their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts.
3.To overcome the challenges, researchers are encouraged to use operando/in situ characterization techniques like XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM) to reveal the active sites and mechanisms of catalysts under reaction conditions. They are also working on establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity, paying special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts. The scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures remains a grand challenge, but novel methods provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.
