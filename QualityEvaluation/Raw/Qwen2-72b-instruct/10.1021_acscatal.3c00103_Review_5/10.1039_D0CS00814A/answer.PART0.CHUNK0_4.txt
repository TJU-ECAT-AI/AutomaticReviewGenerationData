[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
[2] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
[3] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
[4] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
[5] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
[6] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
[7] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
[8] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
[9] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the efficient adsorption and activation of propane, as well as the subsequent desorption of propylene on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. Researchers are addressing these challenges by analyzing the active sites, reaction pathways, and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides. The goal is to design efficient catalysts that minimize reaction barriers and control selectivity towards propylene. Thermodynamic limitations necessitate the regulation of reaction conditions and kinetics to inhibit side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and productivity. Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content and improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts are key areas of focus. The high tendency of Pt catalysts to coking, sintering, and their high cost also require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts through special preparation methods and support and promoter effects.
