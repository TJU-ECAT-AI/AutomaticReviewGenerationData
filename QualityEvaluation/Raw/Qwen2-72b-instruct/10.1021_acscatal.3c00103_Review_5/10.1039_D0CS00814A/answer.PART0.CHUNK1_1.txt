[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
[2] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[3] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
[4] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
[5] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
[6] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
[7] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
[8] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
[9] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
[10] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
[11] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
[12] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[13] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
[14] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
[15] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
[16] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
[17] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
[18] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
[19] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[20] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
[21] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need to inhibit overoxidation of propylene to COx in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and the limited CH activation ability of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts. Opportunities include the potential of ODH to improve reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics, the development of chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, coupling exothermic reactions with PDH to promote propane transformation, and the reduction of energy consumption and operating costs through ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes.
2.Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions by exploring alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, although their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with industrial catalysts. Developing novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired.
3.Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge, and operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors in industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and various species exist on metal oxide-based catalyst surfaces, making it difficult to identify the actual active sites.
4.Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing.
5.Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of challenges, as the preparation of such catalysts is highly fine and requires specific operation steps, especially for shaped and single atom catalysts. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired, and novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括丙烷生产力的热力学限制、在氧化脱氢(ODH)中抑制丙烯过度氧化为COx的需要以及光催化剂和电催化剂的CH活化能力有限。机会包括ODH由于热力学有利而有可能提高反应效率，基于氧化还原催化剂的化学循环氧化脱氢(CL-ODH)的发展，将放热反应与PDH耦合以促进丙烷转化，以及通过接近环境温度或环境温度下的催化脱氢过程降低能耗和运营成本。
2.研究人员通过探索替代传统金属和金属氧化物基催化剂的催化剂，如VOx和GaOx基催化剂，来解决对高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂的需求，尽管它们的脱氢性能与工业催化剂相比仍然不令人满意。开发提高其脱氢性能的新型高效方法是高度期望的。
3.在反应条件下揭示这些催化剂的活性位点和机制是一个重大挑战，应鼓励和操作原位/操作中表征技术。工业PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中不同Sn物种的作用和焦化行为仍然未知，金属氧化物基催化剂表面存在各种物种，这使得识别实际活性位点变得困难。
4.理论计算越来越多地被采用来辅助解释实验结果，但由于实际催化剂和过程的复杂性，实验细节和DFT模型之间的匹配程度有限。建立结构和活性之间的普遍关系是紧迫的。
5.具有明确定义结构的脱氢催化剂的放大仍然充满挑战，因为这种催化剂的制备非常精细，需要特定的操作步骤，特别是对于形状和单原子催化剂。开发热力学稳定的单原子催化剂是高度期望的，强静电吸附、电置换、顺序还原和初始湿浸渍共浸渍等新型方法为单原子催化剂生产的放大提供了机会。
