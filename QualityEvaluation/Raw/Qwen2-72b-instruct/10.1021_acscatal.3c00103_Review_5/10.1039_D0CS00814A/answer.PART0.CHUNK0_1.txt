[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
[2] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
[3] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
[4] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
[5] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
[6] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
[7] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
[8] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
[9] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the efficient adsorption and activation of propane, as well as the subsequent desorption of propylene on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. Researchers are addressing these challenges by analyzing active sites, reaction pathways, and deactivation mechanisms over metals and metal oxides to design efficient catalysts that minimize reaction barriers and control selectivity towards propylene. The need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions is being considered, especially given the thermodynamic limitations of the PDH process. Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content and low Pt-content stable Pt-based catalysts are highly desired to overcome the issues of toxicity, coking, sintering, and high cost. The exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts remain significant challenges.
