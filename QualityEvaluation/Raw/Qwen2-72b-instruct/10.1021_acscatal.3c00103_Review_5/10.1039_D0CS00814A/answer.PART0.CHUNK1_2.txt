[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
[2] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[3] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
[4] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
[5] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
[6] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
[7] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results. However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
[8] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need to inhibit overoxidation of propylene to COx in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and the development of efficient catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes such as ODH, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH), coupling exothermic reactions with PDH, and developing ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes.
2.Researchers are also focusing on developing alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions, improving the matching degree between experimental details and theoretical models, and scaling up dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures.
