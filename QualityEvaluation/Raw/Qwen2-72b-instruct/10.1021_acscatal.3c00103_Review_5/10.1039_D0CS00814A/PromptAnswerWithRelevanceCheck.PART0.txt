[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
[2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
[3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
[4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
[6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
[7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
[8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
[9] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
[10] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
[11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
[12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
[13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
[14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
[15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
[17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
[18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
[19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
[20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
[21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
[22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
[23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
[24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
[25] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
[27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
[28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
[29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need to inhibit overoxidation of propylene to COx in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and the complexity of identifying active sites and reaction mechanisms. Opportunities include the potential of ODH to improve reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics, the development of alternative catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with high olefin selectivity, and the exploration of chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH to promote propane transformation.
2.Researchers are addressing the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions by developing novel methods for catalyst preparation, such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation. They are also focusing on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single-site Pt for PDH, aiming to develop thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts. Additionally, researchers are investigating alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, although their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts.
3.To overcome the challenges, researchers are encouraged to use operando/in situ characterization techniques like XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM) to reveal the active sites and mechanisms of catalysts under reaction conditions. They are also working on establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity, paying special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts. The scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures remains a grand challenge, but novel methods provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the efficient adsorption and activation of propane, as well as the desorption of propylene on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. The reaction is highly endothermic, and thermodynamics favor higher temperatures and lower pressures for increased propane conversion. However, this also increases the rates of side reactions, necessitating the regulation of reaction conditions and kinetics to improve propylene selectivity and productivity. The development of stable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly catalysts is crucial, particularly in light of the limitations of current Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the efficient adsorption and activation of propane, as well as the subsequent desorption of propylene on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing new catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Thermodynamic limitations necessitate the regulation of reaction conditions and kinetics to inhibit side reactions and improve propylene selectivity and productivity. The development of alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired, and there is a need for low platinum-content and stable Pt-based catalysts. The exploitation of new strategies to improve the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and the search for alternative catalysts remain significant challenges.

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
[2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
[3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
[4] "In addition, activating alkane CH bonds at low temperature may provide opportunities to improve the propylene selectivity."
[5] "Therefore, developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is the direction for their industrial application for ODH reactions."
[6] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
[7] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
[8] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
[9] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
[10] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
[11] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
[12] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
[13] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
[14] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
[15] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
[16] "Besides conventional Pt and oxide-based catalysts, transition-metal nitrides and carbides may offer promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts."
[17] "A key issue for improving this class of materials is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range."
[18] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
[19] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
[20] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
[21] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
[22] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
[23] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
[24] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
[25] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
[26] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
[27] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
[28] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
[29] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
[30] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
[31] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
[32] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
[33] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."

They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms.

1.工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括热力学限制丙烷生产力、需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂。研究人员正在通过探索替代脱氢过程,如氧化脱氢(ODH),来应对这些挑战,ODH具有有利的热力学特性,但存在抑制丙烯过度氧化为COx的挑战。他们还在研究新的催化剂,如六方氮化硼(h-BN)和硼氮化纳米管(BNNTs),这些催化剂对烯烃具有高选择性。正在开发低温和高选择性催化剂用于ODH反应,基于氧化还原催化剂的化学循环氧化脱氢(CL-ODH)正被视为一种温和的脱氢技术。将放热反应与吸热PDH耦合是另一种促进丙烷转化的策略。正在探索接近环境温度或环境温度下的催化脱氢过程,如太阳能光催化和电催化,以减少能源消耗和运营成本,尽管它们的性能目前受到CH活化能力不足和复杂反应机制的限制。
2.研究人员还专注于研究替代传统金属和金属氧化物基催化剂的新型催化剂,如VOx和GaOx基催化剂,这些催化剂正在被开发为CrOx基和Pt基催化剂的潜在替代品。然而,这些催化剂的脱氢性能与工业催化剂相比仍然不令人满意。支撑材料的类型、促进剂和制备方法对催化剂结构有显著影响,需要开发新的高效方法来提高它们的脱氢性能。过渡金属氮化物和碳化物正被视为传统贵金属催化剂的有希望的经济替代品,但关键问题在于开发产生具有高表面积和纳米级粒径的材料的合成方法。
3.揭示这些催化剂在反应条件下的活性位点和机制是一个重大挑战。正在鼓励和操作原位/在位表征技术来应对这一挑战。工业PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中不同Sn物种的作用和焦化行为仍然未知,在金属氧化物基催化剂的表面上存在各种物种,特别是在PDH反应条件下,识别实际活性位点是困难的。理论计算越来越多地被采用来协助解释实验结果,但由于实际催化剂和过程的复杂性,实验细节和DFT模型之间的匹配程度有限。建立结构和活性之间的普遍关系是紧迫的,特别是在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中,Sn物种可能在反应条件下动态变化。
4.具有明确定义结构的脱氢催化剂的规模化仍然是一个巨大的挑战。具有明确定义结构的脱氢催化剂的制备高度精细,需要特定的操作步骤,特别是对于那些形状和单原子催化剂。最近关于单点催化的研究集中在利用单原子和/或单点Pt进行PDH,但单原子Pt在PDH条件下仍遭受烧结和重构。在丙烷脱氢领域,开发热力学稳定的单原子催化剂是高度期望的。强静电吸附、电化学置换、顺序还原和初始湿浸渍共沉淀等新方法为单原子催化剂生产的规模化提供了机会。
