[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
[3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
[4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
[5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
[6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
[7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
[8] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."

1.Current commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are mainly divided into two categories: Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalysts are low selectivity to propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have studied the dehydrogenation of propane on different Pt surfaces, including Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211), and found that the dehydrogenation activity follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111). The selectivity of propylene is higher than 85% on both surfaces, which is related to the thermodynamic correction that significantly reduces the free energy barrier for desorption steps. The stepped surface has a stronger activity for the dehydrogenation mechanism. The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers are similar in all three ring-opening pathways, but the transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary significantly. The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during the conversion. The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1, and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer.

1.目前商业丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂主要分为两类:Cr基和Pt基催化剂。Pt基催化剂的主要问题是丙烯选择性低和由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活。研究人员研究了不同Pt表面的丙烷脱氢,包括Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211),发现脱氢活性遵循Pt(211)>Pt(100)>Pt(111)的趋势。两种表面的丙烯选择性均高于85%,这与热力学修正有关,显著降低了脱附步骤的自由能势垒。阶梯表面在脱氢机制方面具有更强的活性。三种环开裂途径中的脱氢和再氢化势垒相似,但CC键断裂的过渡态和势垒差异显著。计算得到的CHC解离势垒高于形成CHC的脱氢势垒,表明在转化过程中可能积累CHC。Pd(111)上最低的CC键断裂势垒为122 kJ mol1,相应的前体为C2二聚体。
