[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
[3] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
[4] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
[5] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
[6] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."
[7] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases."
[8] "The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation for Pt-based catalysts. Researchers are addressing these challenges by studying the dehydrogenation mechanism on different Pt surfaces, such as Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211), to understand the activity and selectivity. Stepped surfaces, like Pt(211), show higher dehydrogenation activity, but the selectivity towards propylene can be higher on surfaces with a large area of Pt(111). The binding energy of propylene on different surfaces affects the selectivity, with a smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicating a stronger preference for propylene desorption. Despite higher desorption barriers, experimental selectivities of propylene are still high, which can be attributed to the lack of thermodynamic correction in DFT calculations that would reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps.

1.丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括基于铂的催化剂对丙烯的低选择性和因焦炭形成导致的快速失活。研究人员通过研究不同铂表面(如Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211))上的脱氢机制来应对这些挑战，以了解活性和选择性。台阶表面，如Pt(211)，显示出更高的脱氢活性，但具有大量Pt(111)表面区域的表面的选择性可能更高。不同表面上丙烯的结合能影响选择性，Pt(111)上较小的能垒差表明丙烯脱附的偏好更强。尽管脱附能垒较高，但丙烯的实验选择性仍然很高，这可以归因于DFT计算中缺乏热力学修正，这将降低脱附步骤的自由能垒。
