[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
[3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
[4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
[5] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
[6] "The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[7] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
[8] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[9] "The continuing improvements of computer hardware, the development of new functionals, as well as the increasing sophistication of computational electronic structure software have insured the ability of a computational study to access more complicated catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces."
[10] "Although the general trend of catalytic activity is not as easy to be addressed for these as for metal systems, the case studies still shed light on dehydrogenation mechanisms in these systems, and more insights emerge which are normally difficult to be explored at molecular level even by the most advanced experimental equipment."
[11] "However, there are still limitations for current theoretical calculations to model more realistic catalytic systems."
[12] "In more complicated cases such as oxides, the reacting molecules can induce change of the structure of a catalyst, creating vacancies or oxidizing surface metal atoms, resulting in a large amount of different types of sites for elementary reactions, and dramatically increase the computational complexity."
[13] "Moreover, many catalytic reactions are catalyzed at the interface of a bi-functional catalyst, which is also not easy to be well described by calculations."
[14] "The lattice mismatch between the particle and support results in a shift of relative positions between sites on particle and surface, which results in different environments of given sites, leading to a large number of possibilities to be considered in a single study."
[15] "Similar issues occur in the case of zeolites, where the possibility to distribute Al atoms in the framework increase rapidly with increase of Al/Si ratio."
[16] "The complexity of the systems mentioned above seems to beyond the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces to a large extent with DFT calculations, which limits most of the current studies which focus to understand one aspect of the catalyst instead of the complete picture of dehydrogenation."
[17] "There is still a long way to go for theoretical studies to generate a complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems."
[18] "In addition to the development of computational approaches, the progress of advanced in situ characterizations has helped in the identification of active sites in complex catalytic systems and offers more guidelines for theoretical studies to build more reliable models."
[19] "On the other hand, controllable synthesis via colloidal chemistry is also necessary which can maximize the content of the theoretically identified highly active and selective sites and structures in a real catalyst."

1.Current commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are mainly divided into two categories: Cr-based and Pt-based. Pt-based catalysts have issues with low selectivity for propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have studied propane dehydrogenation on different Pt surfaces, finding that Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity. The selectivity for propylene is influenced by the thermodynamic correction for desorption barriers, which is not included in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces have been shown to have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The accumulation of CHC during the conversion process is a concern, as it can lead to coke formation. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes. Advances in computational methods have allowed for the study of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. However, there are still limitations in modeling realistic catalytic systems, particularly in cases where the structure of the catalyst can change, such as with oxides, and in bi-functional catalysts where reactions occur at the interface. The complexity of these systems makes it challenging to fully explore the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations. Theoretical studies still have a long way to go to provide a complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization techniques and controllable synthesis methods are necessary to identify active sites and maximize the content of highly active and selective sites in real catalysts.

1.目前商业丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂主要分为两类:Cr基和Pt基。Pt基催化剂存在丙烯选择性低和因焦炭形成导致快速失活的问题。研究人员研究了不同Pt表面的丙烷脱氢,发现Pt(211)具有最高的脱氢活性。丙烯的选择性受脱附能垒的热力学修正影响,而DFT计算中并未包含这一修正。阶梯表面显示出更高的脱氢活性。在转化过程中CHC的积累是一个问题,因为它可能导致焦炭的形成。理论研究的最终目标是为特定化学过程识别最优催化剂。计算方法的进步使得能够研究更复杂的催化系统,而不仅仅局限于简单的过渡金属表面。然而,在模拟现实的催化系统方面仍存在局限性,特别是在催化剂结构可以改变的情况下,如氧化物,以及在双功能催化剂中,反应发生在界面。这些系统的复杂性使得使用DFT计算完全探索势能表面变得困难。理论研究在提供复杂催化系统完整准确的描述方面还有很长的路要走。原位表征技术和可控合成方法对于识别活性位点和在实际催化剂中最大化高活性和选择性位点的含量是必要的。

However, thermodynamic corrections are necessary to accurately estimate the free energy barrier for desorption steps, as the entropy of gas phase propylene is significantly higher than that of the adsorbed form.
