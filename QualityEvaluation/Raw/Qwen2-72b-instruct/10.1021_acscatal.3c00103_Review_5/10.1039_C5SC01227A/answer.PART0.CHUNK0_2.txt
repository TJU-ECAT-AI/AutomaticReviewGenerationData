[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
[2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
[3] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
[4] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
[5] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
[6] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."
[7] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases."
[8] "The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation for Pt-based catalysts. Researchers are addressing these challenges by studying the dehydrogenation mechanism on different Pt surfaces, such as Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211), to understand the activity and selectivity. Stepped surfaces, like Pt(211), show higher dehydrogenation activity, but the selectivity towards propylene can be improved by using octahedral Pt particles with a large surface area of Pt(111). The binding energy of propylene on Pt(111) is lower than on Pt(100), which favors propylene desorption and reduces deep dehydrogenation. Despite higher desorption barriers, experimental selectivities of propylene are still high, which can be further enhanced by considering thermodynamic corrections in DFT calculations.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括基于铂的催化剂对丙烯的选择性低和因焦炭形成导致的快速失活。研究人员通过研究不同铂表面（如Pt(111)、Pt(100)和Pt(211)）上的脱氢机制来应对这些挑战，以理解活性和选择性。阶梯表面，如Pt(211)，显示出更高的脱氢活性，但通过使用具有大Pt(111)表面面积的八面体Pt颗粒可以提高丙烯的选择性。丙烯在Pt(111)上的结合能低于Pt(100)，这有利于丙烯的解吸并减少深度脱氢。尽管解吸势垒较高，但丙烯的实验选择性仍然很高，这可以通过在DFT计算中考虑热力学修正来进一步增强。
