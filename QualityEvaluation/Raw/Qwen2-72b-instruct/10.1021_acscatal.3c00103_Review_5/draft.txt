1. The challenges, opportunities, and ongoing research in developing high-performance catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in industrial propylene production, with a focus on addressing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and thermodynamic limitations.

        The challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are multifaceted, encompassing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, all within thermodynamic constraints \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5\]. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5\]. Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal Pt(211) exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Despite progress, no ODH catalyst has yet achieved a propene yield attractive to industry \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Efforts are concentrated on understanding CH activation and reaction routes to improve dehydrogenation catalysts \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the need for innovative catalyst design and process engineering in PDH for industrial propylene production. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced thermodynamic stability, improved propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides and non-conventional materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), offers promising avenues for improving selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The development of single atom catalysts with thermodynamic stability is a high priority, facilitated by methods like strong electrostatic adsorption and galvanic replacement \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Novel methods for scale-up production of these catalysts present significant opportunities for industrial application. Theoretical calculations and operando/in situ characterization techniques will be crucial for identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].
