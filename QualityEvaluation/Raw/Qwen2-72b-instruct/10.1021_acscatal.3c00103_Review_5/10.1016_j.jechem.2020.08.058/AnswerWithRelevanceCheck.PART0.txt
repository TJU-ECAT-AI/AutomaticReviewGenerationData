          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy wastes, and the need to improve the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize the precious metal and reduce costs. Opportunities exist in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while addressing thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene and investigating eligible catalysts with good overall performance. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene production, which is economically and environmentally attractive due to the abundance of shale gas containing light alkanes. PDH is significant for industrial relevance. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their considerable activity in PDH reactions, and there is a strong desire to enhance their activity to better utilize the precious metal platinum and reduce catalyst costs. However, the challenge of metal species agglomeration during reactions or regeneration processes, which leads to catalytic deactivation, must be addressed for potential industrial applications. The introduction of a second component has the potential to improve catalytic performance and suppress coke formation during PDH, but stabilizing platinum species on supports under high-temperature reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative to traditional petrochemical routes for producing propylene, a key chemical intermediate. The challenge is to develop efficient catalysts that can operate at high temperatures with good propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions and waste. Researchers are focusing on improving the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize this precious metal and reduce costs. They are also addressing the issue of metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during reactions or regeneration processes, which are critical for the industrial application of PDH catalysts.
