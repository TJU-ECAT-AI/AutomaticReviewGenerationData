[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] . More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment."
[2] "Pt-based catalyst has been developed as a well-known type of catalysts that shows considerable activity for PDH reaction. It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene production, which is economically and environmentally attractive due to the abundance of shale gas containing light alkanes. PDH is significant for industrial relevance. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their considerable activity in PDH reactions, and there is a strong desire to enhance their activity to better utilize the precious metal platinum and reduce catalyst costs. However, the challenge of metal species agglomeration during reactions or regeneration processes, which leads to catalytic deactivation, must be addressed for potential industrial applications. The introduction of a second component has the potential to improve catalytic performance and suppress coke formation during PDH, but stabilizing platinum species on supports under high-temperature reaction conditions remains a significant challenge.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）是替代石油基丙烯生产的一种途径，由于富含轻烷的页岩气的丰富，PDH在经济和环境上具有吸引力，对工业具有重要意义。铂基催化剂因其在PDH反应中的显著活性而闻名，强烈希望提高其活性，以更好地利用贵金属铂并降低催化剂成本。然而，反应或再生过程中金属物种的聚集导致催化失活的问题，必须为潜在的工业应用解决。引入第二种成分具有改善催化性能和抑制PDH过程中焦炭形成的巨大潜力，但在高温反应条件下在载体上稳定铂物种仍然是一个重大挑战。
