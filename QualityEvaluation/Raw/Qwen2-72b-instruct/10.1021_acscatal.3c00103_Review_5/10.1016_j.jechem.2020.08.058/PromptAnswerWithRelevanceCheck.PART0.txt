[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
[2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
[4] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] . More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an alternative route to produce propylene, which is significant for industrial relevance and is more economically and environmentally attractive due to the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes. Pt-based catalysts have been developed for PDH, but there is a need to improve their activity to better utilize precious metal platinum and reduce catalyst cost. The agglomeration of metal species during reaction or regeneration and the resulting catalytic deactivation are challenges that need to be addressed for industrial applications. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ti, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Zn, have been investigated to improve the activity and stability of Pt species in PDH reactions. The introduction of a second metal species can significantly promote the activity and stability of Pt species, and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH. However, stabilizing Pt species on supports under high-temperature reaction conditions remains a challenge. The migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction is more relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits. High-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls, such as Al2O3 or SiO2, are widely used to disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH.

1.丙烷脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的替代途径，具有重要的工业相关性，并且由于富含轻烷烃的页岩气的可用性，从经济和环境角度来看更具吸引力。已经开发了基于Pt的催化剂用于PDH，但需要提高其活性以更好地利用贵金属铂并降低催化剂成本。在反应或再生过程中金属物种的聚集以及由此导致的催化失活是工业应用中需要解决的挑战。已经研究了基于Pt的双金属催化剂，如Pt-Ti、Pt-Ga、Pt-Cu、Pt-Sn和Pt-Zn，以提高PDH反应中Pt物种的活性和稳定性。引入第二种金属物种可以显着促进Pt物种的活性和稳定性，并且还可以在PDH过程中抑制不需要的焦炭形成。然而，在高温反应条件下在载体上稳定Pt物种仍然具有挑战性。在PDH反应期间，亚纳米级Pt物种的迁移与Pt-Sn催化剂的失活相关性更大，而不是焦炭沉积的形成。具有丰富表面羟基的高比表面积载体，如Al2O3或SiO2，被广泛用于分散和稳定PDH的基于Pt的双组分物种。
