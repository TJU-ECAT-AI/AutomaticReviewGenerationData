[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
[2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
[4] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications."

1.The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy wastes, and the need to improve the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize the precious metal and reduce costs. Opportunities exist in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while addressing thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene and investigating eligible catalysts with good overall performance.
