[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
[2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
[4] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative to traditional petrochemical routes for producing propylene, a key chemical intermediate. The challenge is to develop efficient catalysts that can operate at high temperatures with good propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions and waste. Researchers are focusing on improving the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize this precious metal and reduce costs. They are also addressing the issue of metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during reactions or regeneration processes, which are critical for the industrial application of PDH catalysts.
