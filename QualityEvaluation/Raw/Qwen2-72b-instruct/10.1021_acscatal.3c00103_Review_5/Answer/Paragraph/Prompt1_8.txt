{"DOC": "PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Alternative catalysts like metal oxides have been explored but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and poor regeneration. Researchers aim to improve noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price gap between propane and propylene.

{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and vital for industrial polymers, driving efforts for direct alkane conversion. However, increasing temperature enhances alkane conversion but reduces alkene selectivity due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a lower energy pathway. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield. Research is advancing understanding of CH activation and reaction routes, aiming to design efficient catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation, with a focus on propane for propene production. ODH operates at lower temperatures than non-ODH, motivating its development into an industrial technology. However, despite progress, no ODH catalyst has yet met industry standards for propene yield.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition (Quote 1). Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring (Quote 4), and support modifications (Quote 2) to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, excessive metal promoters (Quote 3) and complex processes for hydroxyl anchoring and encapsulation (Quote 10) pose economic and practical issues. Utilizing supports with large outer surfaces (Quote 6) and hierarchical zeolites (Quote 12) can alleviate diffusion limitations. Understanding promoter effects (Quote 8) and affordable support preparation (Quote 11) remain urgent research areas.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "Commercial PDH catalysts are Cr- and Pt-based, with Pt-based ones facing low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation (Quote 1). Studies show Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity (Quote 2). Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not considered in DFT calculations (Quote 3). Stepped surfaces like Pt(221) exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity (Quote 4). CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than dehydrogenation, leads to coke formation (Quote 11). Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization and controlled synthesis are crucial for identifying and maximizing active, selective sites in real catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
{"DOC": "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for enhanced Pt-based catalysts to optimize platinum use and reduce costs. Opportunities lie in PDH as an alternative to petrochemical routes, economically and environmentally attractive due to shale gas. Researchers aim to develop catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, addressing thermodynamic limitations. Bimetallic Pt-based catalysts, like Pt-Sn, have shown promise in improving activity and suppressing coke formation, but stabilizing Pt species under high-temperature conditions remains a challenge.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, challenges include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to improve reaction efficiency, despite the challenge of inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. Alternative catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise for high selectivity to olefins. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is considered a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH can promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, offer energy savings but are limited by insufficient CH activation ability and complex reaction mechanisms. VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts are being developed as alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is a significant challenge, addressed through operando/in situ characterization techniques. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is challenging, and developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired. Novel methods provide opportunities for the scale-up of single atom catalyst production.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for industrial propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, but PtSn and CrOx systems remain superior due to lower deactivation rates and higher space velocities. Current technologies require improvement in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price gap between propane and propylene, and the technique's ability to yield a specific olefin. Dozens of new PDH installations are in development globally, mirroring a similar trend in BDH, driven by automotive demand and the high cost of naphtha cracking.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
