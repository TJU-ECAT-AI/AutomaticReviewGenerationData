The development of high-performance catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in industrial propylene production is a critical area of research, driven by the increasing demand for propylene as a key petrochemical feedstock. PDH catalysts face significant challenges, primarily related to high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity. High temperatures are necessary to achieve the desired conversion rates, but they also lead to catalyst deactivation and sintering, reducing the catalyst's lifespan and efficiency. Moreover, achieving high propylene selectivity while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts such as coke and carbon monoxide is a major hurdle. Ongoing research in this field is exploring various strategies to address these issues. One approach involves the development of bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts that can enhance both stability and selectivity by optimizing the active sites' electronic properties. Another focus is on understanding the fundamental thermodynamic limitations of PDH, which can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. Researchers are also investigating the use of advanced materials such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that offer tunable porosity and acidity, which can improve the diffusion of reactants and products and enhance selectivity. These efforts not only aim to improve the economics of propylene production but also to reduce the environmental impact by minimizing energy consumption and waste generation.

The challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are multifaceted, encompassing the inertness of lower alkanes, high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Researchers address these issues by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical, and hydroxyl anchoring and encapsulation techniques can be complex and expensive \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Utilizing hierarchical zeolites as supports can alleviate diffusion limitations, but rare templates hinder industrial application \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Commercial PDH catalysts, predominantly Cr- and Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal that Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not accounted for in DFT calculations \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier, poses a risk for coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. In situ characterization and controlled synthesis are crucial for identifying and maximizing active and selective sites in real catalysts \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the critical role of catalyst development in overcoming the challenges of propane dehydrogenation for industrial propylene production. The pursuit of high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions is central to ongoing research. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can address thermodynamic limitations while maintaining high selectivity and stability. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based materials, presents an opportunity to diversify the catalyst portfolio and potentially overcome the limitations of current Pt-based systems. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is a high priority, with novel methods for scale-up production offering promising avenues for progress. The integration of in situ characterization techniques and theoretical calculations will be crucial for understanding the dynamic changes of active sites under reaction conditions and for optimizing catalyst performance. The development of efficient and cost-effective encapsulation and hydroxyl anchoring techniques could lead to more stable and economically viable catalysts. The potential of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation, suggests a promising direction for future research. Coupling exothermic reactions with PDH and exploring ambient temperature catalytic processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis could reduce energy consumption and enhance the efficiency of propylene production. The identification of active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions remains a significant challenge, necessitating the continued development of operando/in situ characterization techniques. The scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures presents significant challenges, particularly for single atom catalysts, which suffer from sintering and reconstruction under PDH conditions. Addressing these challenges will require a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from materials science, chemical engineering, and computational chemistry.
