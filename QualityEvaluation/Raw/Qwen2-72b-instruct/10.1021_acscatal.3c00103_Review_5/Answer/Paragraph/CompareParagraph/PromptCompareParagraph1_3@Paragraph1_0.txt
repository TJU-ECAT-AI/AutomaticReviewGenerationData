In the realm of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, the quest for high-performance catalysts is paramount, with a focus on addressing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and thermodynamic limitations \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. The inertness of lower alkanes necessitates indirect conversion routes to valuable chemicals, with alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, serving as essential intermediates in polymer production \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is desirable but faces thermodynamic limitations, with alkene selectivity decreasing at higher temperatures due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, and coke formation \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry's propene yield requirements \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

                    High-temperature stability and propylene selectivity in PDH catalysts are critical, with thermodynamic limitations and side reactions posing significant challenges \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. High temperatures, while necessary for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Researchers are developing high-performance catalysts using strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Encapsulation is a hot topic for size control and spatial segmentation \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. However, excessive metal promoters and complex processes for hydroxyl anchoring are uneconomical \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Selecting proper ligands for encapsulation and using rare templates for supports with large outer surfaces hinder industrial application \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\].

                    Commercial PDH catalysts are Cr- and Pt-based, with Pt-based catalysts facing low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not accounted for in DFT calculations \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Stepped surfaces exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by higher dissociation barriers, aligns with experimental observations and is a concern for coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems, requiring in situ characterization and controlled synthesis for active site identification \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

                    PDH presents an alternative to petrochemical propylene production, leveraging abundant shale gas for economic and environmental benefits \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Key challenges include high energy use, waste production, and enhancing Pt-based catalysts for better platinum utilization and cost reduction \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Researchers aim to develop catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, addressing thermodynamic limitations \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Sn, have shown promise in improving activity and stability, but stabilizing Pt species under high-temperature conditions remains a significant hurdle \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. The introduction of a second metal component can suppress coke formation, yet controlling metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation is crucial for industrial PDH applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\].

                    Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Alternative catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise with high selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Strategies include developing low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for ODH, considering chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, and coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis aim to reduce energy consumption, though their performance is limited \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, are being developed but have unsatisfactory dehydrogenation performances \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is challenging, necessitating operando/in situ characterization techniques \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is a grand challenge, with single atom catalysts showing potential but suffering from sintering and reconstruction \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is a high priority \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

                    PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, which have not yet matched the performance of PtSn and CrOx systems, particularly in terms of deactivation rates due to coke deposition \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Further research aims to lower noble metal loading, enhance catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene, and dehydrogenation technologies yield specific olefins of polymer-quality purity \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Increased demand and reduced supply have led to a surge in butadiene prices, prompting investment in BDH installations globally \[10.1021/cr5002436\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while maintaining high propylene selectivity and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene production, such as the utilization of abundant shale gas, presents a promising avenue for economic and environmental benefits. The development of thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts, which can overcome the challenges of sintering and reconstruction, is a high priority. Additionally, the optimization of existing catalysts, such as Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, to improve activity and stability under high-temperature conditions is crucial. Strategies like chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH offer potential for improving efficiency. The identification of active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, facilitated by advanced operando/in situ characterization techniques, is essential for the design of more efficient catalysts. The scale-up of well-defined catalysts remains a significant challenge, necessitating the development of novel synthesis methods. Theoretical calculations can assist in understanding experimental results, but matching experimental details with DFT models requires further refinement. The establishment of a structure-activity relationship, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, is crucial for the rational design of catalysts. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based materials, as potential replacements for CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts, is ongoing, with a focus on enhancing dehydrogenation performance. The development of ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes, like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, offers potential for reducing energy consumption, although their performance is currently limited by CH activation ability and complex reaction mechanisms. The roles of Sn species and coking behaviors on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts remain areas of ongoing research. The potential of single atom catalysts for PDH is promising, but their stability under PDH conditions needs to be improved. Novel synthesis methods offer opportunities for the scale-up of single atom catalyst production.
