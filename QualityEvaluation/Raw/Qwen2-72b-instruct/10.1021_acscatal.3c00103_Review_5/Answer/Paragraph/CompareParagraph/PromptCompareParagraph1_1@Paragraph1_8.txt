The challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are multifaceted, encompassing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, all within thermodynamic constraints \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal Pt(211) exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Despite progress, no ODH catalyst has yet achieved a propene yield attractive to industry \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Efforts are concentrated on understanding CH activation and reaction routes to improve dehydrogenation catalysts \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the need for innovative catalyst design and process engineering in PDH for industrial propylene production. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced thermodynamic stability, improved propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides and non-conventional materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), offers promising avenues for improving selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The development of single atom catalysts with thermodynamic stability is a high priority, facilitated by methods like strong electrostatic adsorption and galvanic replacement \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Novel methods for scale-up production of these catalysts present significant opportunities for industrial application. Theoretical calculations and operando/in situ characterization techniques will be crucial for identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production confronts significant challenges, including the conversion of inert lower alkanes into valuable alkenes, particularly propene, a key polymer monomer \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Direct conversion is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a lower energy path, requiring innovative catalysts and process design to synergize endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Despite progress, gaps remain between lab achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry's propene yield requirements \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

High-temperature stability and propylene selectivity are critical in PDH catalysts, amidst thermodynamic limitations and side reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. High temperatures, though beneficial for propane conversion, exacerbate sintering and coke deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation. Researchers are developing strategies: introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications, to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Encapsulation and hydroxyl anchoring show promise, but face issues like excessive metal promoters and complex ligand selection \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

Commercial PDH catalysts are Cr- and Pt-based, with Pt-based catalysts facing low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation from coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies show Pt(211) surfaces have the highest dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not considered in DFT calculations \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Stepped surfaces exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. CHC accumulation during conversion is a concern, indicating possible coke formation, as the CHC dissociation barrier is higher than the dehydrogenation barrier, aligning with experimental observations \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

PDH for industrial propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for improved Pt-based catalysts to reduce costs \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Opportunities lie in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers aim to enhance Pt-based catalysts' activity and address metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation, crucial for industrial applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\].

PDH for industrial propylene production faces challenges including thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity and the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Researchers explore ODH, which has favorable thermodynamics but requires inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise with high selectivity to olefins \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. CL-ODH based on redox catalysts is considered for moderate dehydrogenation, and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH promotes propane transformation \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis aim to reduce energy consumption, though their performance is limited \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Alternative catalysts like VOx- and GaOx-based are being developed as alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is unsatisfactory \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, have been explored but lack the stability and regeneration capabilities of PtSn and CrOx systems \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Research aims to reduce noble metal loading, enhance catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency \[10.1021/cr5002436\]. Strategies are sought to overcome equilibrium conversion limits and side reactions \[10.1021/cr5002436\].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can address the high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as h-BN and BNNTs, presents a promising avenue for improving olefin selectivity while mitigating overoxidation issues \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The utilization of CL-ODH based on redox catalysts and the coupling of exothermic reactions with PDH could potentially enhance propane transformation efficiency \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Additionally, the optimization of Pt-based catalysts to reduce costs and improve activity, addressing metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation, is crucial for industrial applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. The development of thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts, which can overcome the challenges of sintering and reconstruction under PDH conditions, is a high priority \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Novel synthesis methods offer opportunities for the scale-up of single atom catalyst production, potentially revolutionizing the PDH process for industrial propylene production.
