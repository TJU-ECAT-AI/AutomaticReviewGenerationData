The challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are multifaceted, encompassing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, all within thermodynamic constraints \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal Pt(211) exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Despite progress, no ODH catalyst has yet achieved a propene yield attractive to industry \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Efforts are concentrated on understanding CH activation and reaction routes to improve dehydrogenation catalysts \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the need for innovative catalyst design and process engineering in PDH for industrial propylene production. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced thermodynamic stability, improved propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides and non-conventional materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), offers promising avenues for improving selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The development of single atom catalysts with thermodynamic stability is a high priority, facilitated by methods like strong electrostatic adsorption and galvanic replacement \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Novel methods for scale-up production of these catalysts present significant opportunities for industrial application. Theoretical calculations and operando/in situ characterization techniques will be crucial for identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production confronts significant challenges due to the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating the development of economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\]. Direct conversion to alkenes is desirable but faces thermodynamic limitations, as alkene selectivity decreases with temperature and chain length, leading to side reactions. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield for industry \[10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016\].

                    In PDH for industrial propylene production, challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations. High temperatures, though beneficial for propane conversion, cause side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke. Strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications aim to create stable catalysts. However, excessive metal promoters, complex hydroxyl anchoring, and proper ligand selection in encapsulation pose issues \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\].

                    Pt-based catalysts face challenges including low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies reveal Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity. Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not accounted for in DFT calculations. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than dehydrogenation, aligns with experimental observations and is a concern for coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

                    PDH for propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for improved Pt-based catalysts to optimize platinum use and reduce costs. Opportunities lie in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene, leveraging the economic and environmental benefits of shale gas. Enhancing Pt-based catalysts' activity and addressing metal agglomeration and deactivation are critical for industrial applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\].

                    Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Ongoing research explores alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but requires inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. Alternative catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise with high selectivity to olefins. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is considered for moderate dehydrogenation. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH and ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are being explored to reduce energy consumption, though their performance is limited \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production, including high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations, necessitate innovative catalyst design and process optimization. The ongoing research in developing alternative catalysts, such as h-BN and BNNTs, and exploring processes like ODH and CL-ODH, indicates a promising direction for overcoming the limitations of current technologies. Future research efforts might focus on enhancing the stability and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts, developing novel catalysts with high-temperature stability and resistance to side reactions, and optimizing processes to reduce energy consumption and waste production. The economic and environmental benefits of shale gas offer an opportunity to explore alternative routes to propylene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and efficient industrial processes.
