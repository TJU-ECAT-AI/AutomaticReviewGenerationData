Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production are multifaceted, encompassing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, all within the constraints of thermodynamics \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Researchers are developing strategies such as promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\], and encapsulation techniques require proper ligands, adding complexity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Diffusion restriction in supports with large outer surfaces is hindered by the use of rare templates \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\]. Hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports offer a solution to diffusion limitations \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103\_5\].

                    Commercial PDH catalysts, particularly Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Studies reveal that Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. Thermodynamic corrections are crucial for accurate selectivity calculations, as they significantly reduce free energy barriers for desorption steps \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\]. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier, poses a risk for coke formation, aligning with experimental observations \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

                    PDH offers an alternative to petrochemical routes for propylene production, leveraging abundant shale gas \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Challenges include high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for enhanced Pt-based catalysts \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Researchers aim to develop catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Pt-based catalysts require improvement for better utilization and cost reduction \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\]. Agglomeration of metal species and catalytic deactivation are critical issues for industrial applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production, including high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, necessitate innovative strategies and advanced catalyst development. The ongoing research in developing high-performance catalysts for PDH, with a focus on addressing high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and thermodynamic limitations, is promising. Future directions might include the exploration of novel catalyst supports, such as hierarchical zeolites, to mitigate diffusion limitations and enhance catalyst performance. Additionally, the development of advanced encapsulation techniques with optimized ligands could offer a solution to the complex issue of catalyst stability and resistance to sintering and coke formation. Theoretical studies and computational methods, such as DFT calculations, can play a pivotal role in understanding the active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, guiding the design of more efficient and selective catalysts. The scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures, particularly single atom catalysts, remains a grand challenge, but novel synthesis methods and stabilization strategies offer opportunities for improving their stability and performance under PDH conditions.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the need for innovative catalyst design and process engineering in PDH for industrial propylene production. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced thermodynamic stability, improved propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. The exploration of alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides and non-conventional materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), offers promising avenues for improving selectivity and stability \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. The development of single atom catalysts with thermodynamic stability is a high priority, facilitated by methods like strong electrostatic adsorption and galvanic replacement \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\]. Novel methods for scale-up production of these catalysts present significant opportunities for industrial application. Theoretical calculations and operando/in situ characterization techniques will be crucial for identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, guiding the design of more efficient catalysts \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].
