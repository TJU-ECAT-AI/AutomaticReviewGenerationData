{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations, catalyst stability, selectivity, and side reactions. Researchers explore oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite overoxidation challenges. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise for high olefin selectivity. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH are considered. Ambient temperature catalytic processes aim to reduce energy consumption but need improved CH activation. Alternative catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based, are developed but require performance enhancement. Supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly impact catalyst structures. Operando/in situ techniques are crucial for understanding active sites and mechanisms. Identifying active sites on metal oxides under PDH conditions is complex. Theoretical calculations assist in explaining experimental results but have limitations. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is challenging. Single-site catalysis, focusing on single-atom Pt, is pursued, but thermodynamic stability is needed. Novel methods offer opportunities for single atom catalyst scale-up.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints. Alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, have shown promise but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and irrecoverable activity. Pt-based catalysts outperform in terms of deactivation rates and space velocities. Ongoing research aims to lower noble metal loading, enhance catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Strategies are being developed to overcome equilibrium conversion limits and side reactions at high temperatures. Favorable market conditions for PDH are driven by the price difference between propane and propylene, making the technology profitable. Dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, yielding pure olefins. Industrial processes are optimized for polymer-quality olefin production. A surge in PDH installations is anticipated globally, with many already in construction. Similar market advantages exist for butane dehydrogenation, spurred by automotive demand and reduced naphtha cracking supply, leading to increased butadiene prices and investments in BDH facilities in the US, China, and Japan.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for direct conversion to alkenes, which are more reactive and valuable as industrial polymer intermediates. Alkene selectivity decreases with temperature due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation, highlighting the need for high-temperature stability in catalysts. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but ODH offers potential energy savings. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design to synergize dehydrogenation with hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield for industry. Efforts are focused on understanding CH activation and designing efficient catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation, with a specific emphasis on propane dehydrogenation as an alternative technology for propene production.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations. High temperatures, though necessary for propane conversion, cause side reactions and catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers address these by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical, encapsulation requires proper ligands, and hydroxyl anchoring is complex. Utilizing supports with large outer surfaces can decrease diffusion restriction, but rare templates hinder industrial application. Hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports offer a solution to diffusion limitations.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "Commercial PDH catalysts are Cr- or Pt-based, with Pt catalysts facing low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation (Quote 1). Studies show Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces (Quote 2). Propylene selectivity is higher than 85% on Pt(111) and Pt(100), influenced by thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers not included in DFT calculations (Quote 3). Stepped surfaces exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity, and the accumulation of CHC during conversion may lead to coke formation, a concern for catalyst performance. Theoretical studies aim to identify optimal catalysts, but limitations in modeling realistic catalytic systems persist, necessitating in situ characterization and controlled synthesis methods to maximize active and selective sites in real catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for propylene production faces challenges including high energy use, waste production, and the need for enhanced Pt-based catalysts. Opportunities lie in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers aim to improve Pt catalyst activity for better utilization and cost reduction, while addressing metal agglomeration and deactivation issues. The introduction of a second metal component can boost performance and suppress coke formation, but stabilizing Pt species under high temperatures remains a challenge. PDH, as an alternative to petrochemical routes, is economically and environmentally attractive due to shale gas availability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058"},

Researchers explore oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise with high olefin selectivity. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) using redox catalysts is considered for moderate dehydrogenation. Coupling exothermic reactions with PDH can promote propane transformation.
