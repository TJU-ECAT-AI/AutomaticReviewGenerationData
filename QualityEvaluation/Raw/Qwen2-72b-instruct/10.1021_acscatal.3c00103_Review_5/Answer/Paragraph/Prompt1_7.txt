Researchers are exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene, focusing on enhancing Pt-based catalysts' activity and addressing metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation. Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ti, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Zn, have shown promise in improving activity and stability, with the Oleflex PDH process using Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 successfully commercialized.

{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx. Alternative catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise with 79% propylene selectivity. Ongoing research includes chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH. Ambient temperature catalytic processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis aim to reduce energy consumption, but their performance is limited by CH activation ability and complex reaction mechanisms. VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts are being developed as alternatives to CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is unsatisfactory compared to industrial standards. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is urgent, necessitating operando/in situ characterization techniques. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures remains challenging, particularly for single atom catalysts, which suffer from sintering and reconstruction under PDH conditions. Novel synthesis methods offer opportunities for improving single atom catalyst stability.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for propylene production, key challenges include developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints. Researchers are exploring alternatives to PtSn and CrOx systems, like metal oxides, but these often deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and regeneration inefficiencies. Improvements are sought in noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price gap between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation is advantageous for producing specific olefins of high purity. New PDH installations are proliferating globally. Similar market dynamics apply to butane dehydrogenation, driven by automotive demand and naphtha cracking costs, leading to butadiene price hikes and investment in BDH facilities.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect or multi-step routes for conversion to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are more reactive and key to industrial polymers, driving the need for direct conversion technologies. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers potential energy savings. ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process designs to synergize endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield for industry. Research focuses on understanding CH activation and reaction routes to improve dehydrogenation efficiency, with propane dehydrogenation as a critical area for alternative propene production methods.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations. High temperatures, necessary for propane conversion, induce side reactions and catalyst deactivation via sintering and coke deposition. Researchers address these by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, excessive metal promoters are costly, hydroxyl anchoring is complex, and encapsulation requires proper ligands, making these strategies uneconomical. Diffusion restriction in supports with large outer surfaces is hindered by the need for rare templates, impacting industrial application.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "Commercial PDH catalysts, primarily Pt-based, face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies reveal Pt(211) exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces. Selectivity for propylene is higher than 85% on these surfaces, influenced by thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers not considered in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces, like Pt(221), show enhanced activity for dehydrogenation. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier, poses a risk for coke formation. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization and controlled synthesis are crucial for identifying and maximizing active, selective sites in real catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
