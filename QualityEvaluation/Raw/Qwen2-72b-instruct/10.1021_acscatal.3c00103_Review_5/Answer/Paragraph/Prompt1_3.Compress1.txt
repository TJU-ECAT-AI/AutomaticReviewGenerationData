{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect conversion routes to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and serve as industrial polymer intermediates. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is desirable but faces thermodynamic limitations, with alkene selectivity decreasing at higher temperatures due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but ODH offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry's propene yield requirements.

{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise for high olefin selectivity. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH are being considered to improve efficiency. Ambient temperature catalytic processes offer energy savings but require improved CH activation ability. Alternative catalysts like VOx- and GaOx-based materials are being developed to replace CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts, though their performance is currently unsatisfactory. Research is needed to understand active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions, and to scale up well-defined catalyst structures. Single atom catalysts are promising but suffer from sintering under PDH conditions. Novel synthesis methods offer opportunities for scale-up.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are developing alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, but they deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and regeneration issues. Opportunities lie in improving noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene.

{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect conversion routes to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are crucial for industrial polymers, driving the need for direct alkane conversion. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but ODH offers a lower energy pathway. Commercial ODH requires innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between lab achievements and industrial application. Propane dehydrogenation is a focus for alternative propene production, with ongoing efforts to understand CH activation and design efficient catalysts. ODH operates at lower temperatures than non-ODH, motivating its development into an industrial technology. However, no ODH catalyst has yet achieved a propene yield attractive to industry.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations. High temperatures, essential for propane conversion, can cause side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke formation. Researchers address these by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical, encapsulation requires proper ligands, and hydroxyl anchoring can be complex and expensive. Utilizing supports with large outer surfaces can decrease diffusion restriction but needs rare templates, hindering industrial application.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
