{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, challenges include the inert nature of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, like propene, are key industrial polymers. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is desirable but faces thermodynamic limitations, with alkene selectivity decreasing at higher temperatures due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design, including synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion steps. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Researchers aim to design efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, focusing on propane dehydrogenation for alternative propene production. Non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches are being surveyed, with the goal of developing ODH into an industrial technology.

High temperatures, crucial for propane conversion, can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction and encapsulation to enhance catalyst stability and resistance to sintering and coke formation. Encapsulation, in particular, is a promising approach for size control and spatial segmentation, while modifying support structures with large outer surfaces can reduce diffusion restrictions.

The influence of supports, promoters, and preparation methods on catalyst structures necessitates novel methods for performance enhancement. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is challenging, requiring operando/in situ characterization techniques. The roles of Sn species and coking behaviors on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are unknown, complicating the identification of active sites on metal oxides. Theoretical calculations assist in explaining experimental results, but matching experimental details with DFT models is limited. Establishing a structure-activity relationship is crucial, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

Stepped surfaces, like Pt(221), show enhanced activity for dehydrogenation (Quote 4). The high barrier for CHC dissociation (138 kJ mol-1) compared to its formation indicates potential CHC accumulation, aligning with experimental observations (Quote 6). On Pt(100), propylene binds strongly (118 kJ mol-1), while on Pt(111), the binding is less (94 kJ mol-1), and the dehydrogenation barrier is higher (73 kJ mol-1), suggesting a preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) (Quote 9).", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
{"DOC": "PDH offers an alternative to petrochemical propylene production, leveraging abundant shale gas for economic and environmental benefits. Challenges include high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for improved Pt-based catalysts to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Researchers aim to develop catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, addressing thermodynamic limitations. Bimetallic Pt catalysts, like Pt-Sn, have shown promise in commercial processes, but stabilizing Pt species under high-temperature conditions remains a critical challenge. The introduction of a second metal can boost activity and suppress coke formation, yet controlling metal agglomeration is essential for industrial viability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Ongoing research explores oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) show promise with high selectivity to olefins. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is considered for moderate dehydrogenation. Coupling exothermic reactions with PDH can promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes, like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, aim to reduce energy consumption but are limited by CH activation ability and complex mechanisms. Alternative catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based, are being developed but have unsatisfactory performance. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is challenging, necessitating operando/in situ characterization techniques. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures presents significant challenges. Single atom Pt catalysts show potential but suffer from sintering and reconstruction. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is a high priority. Novel methods offer opportunities for scale-up production of single atom catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production involve developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring alternatives to PtSn and CrOx systems, like metal oxides, but these deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and regeneration inefficiency. Opportunities include improving noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies yield specific olefins and produce polymer-quality purity.

{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect or multi-step conversion routes. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and serve as industrial polymer intermediates. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is sought after, but faces thermodynamic limitations, with alkene selectivity decreasing at higher temperatures due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but ODH offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design to synergize endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry standards for propene yield. Efforts focus on understanding CH activation and designing efficient catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation, with propane dehydrogenation as a critical area due to the need for alternative propene production methods. ODH's lower temperature requirement compared to non-ODH is encouraging for its development into an industrial technology.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include achieving high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity in catalysts, while overcoming thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures, necessary for propane conversion, can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, issues persist, such as the uneconomical use of metal promoters, complex hydroxyl anchoring processes, and the need for proper ligands in encapsulation. Diffusion restriction in supports with large outer surfaces, often requiring rare templates, also hinders industrial application.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
