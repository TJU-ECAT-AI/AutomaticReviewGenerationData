{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect or multi-step routes for conversion to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and serve as industrial polymer intermediates, driving the need for direct conversion technologies. However, increasing temperature boosts alkane conversion but reduces alkene selectivity due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but ODH offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH hinges on innovative catalyst and process design, including synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between lab achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry's propene yield standards. Researchers are focusing on CH activation insights and rational catalyst design for efficient dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, with a particular emphasis on propane dehydrogenation as an alternative propene production method. Non-ODH and intermediate reaction routes are also being explored.

{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, challenges include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Ongoing research explores ODH for its thermodynamic benefits, despite overoxidation challenges. New catalysts, such as h-BN and BNNTs, show promise with high olefin selectivity. Alternative dehydrogenation processes, like CL-ODH, and coupling exothermic reactions with PDH are being considered. Ambient temperature catalytic processes aim to reduce energy consumption but face limitations in CH activation. VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts are potential alternatives to CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is unsatisfactory. Supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly impact catalyst structures, necessitating novel methods for improvement. Identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is challenging, requiring advanced characterization techniques. Scale-up of well-defined catalysts is difficult, especially for single atom catalysts prone to sintering. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is crucial. Theoretical calculations assist in understanding experimental results, but matching experimental details with models is limited.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints. Alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, have been explored but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and irrecoverable activity. Research aims to enhance noble metal efficiency, improve catalyst stability, and optimize energy use. Strategies are sought to address equilibrium conversion limits and side reactions at high temperatures. Favorable market conditions for PDH, driven by the price gap between propane and propylene, and the exclusive olefin yield of dehydrogenation technologies, have led to a surge in PDH installations globally. Similar market dynamics for butane dehydrogenation, influenced by automotive demand and naphtha cracking costs, have increased butadiene prices and spurred BDH investments in the US, China, and Japan.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion to alkenes. Alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key industrial polymer intermediates. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is desirable but faces challenges due to increased dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation at higher temperatures. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design, including synergy between endothermic dehydrogenation and exothermic hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield for industry. Efforts are focused on understanding CH activation and designing efficient catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation, with propane dehydrogenation as a key area due to the need for alternative propene production technologies. ODH of alkanes at lower temperatures compared to non-ODH is encouraging for industrial technology development.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures, though beneficial for propane conversion, can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers address these by developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, issues like uneconomical use of metal promoters, complex hydroxyl anchoring, and ligand selection in encapsulation hinder progress. Utilizing hierarchical zeolites as supports offers a solution to diffusion limitations, but rare templates needed for large outer surfaces pose industrial application challenges.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for propylene production, Pt-based catalysts face challenges with low selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies reveal Pt(211) exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces. Selectivity for propylene is influenced by thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers, not accounted for in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces, like Pt(221), show enhanced dehydrogenation activity. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than dehydrogenation, aligns with experimental observations and may lead to coke formation. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems. In situ techniques and controlled synthesis are crucial for identifying and maximizing active, selective sites in real catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
