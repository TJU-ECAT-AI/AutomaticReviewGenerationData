{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion to alkenes. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and vital for industrial polymers. Direct conversion of lower alkanes to alkenes is desirable but faces thermodynamic limitations, as alkene selectivity decreases with temperature and chain length, promoting dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a lower energy pathway. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process design, focusing on the synergy between dehydrogenation and hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry standards for propene yield. Researchers aim to understand CH activation and reaction routes to improve PDH catalysts, focusing on propane due to the need for alternative propene production methods. Non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches are being explored, with ODH showing promise at lower temperatures, motivating its development into an industrial technology.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

High temperatures, necessary for propane conversion, can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition. Researchers address these by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. Encapsulation is a promising strategy for size control and spatial segmentation, while hydroxyl anchoring can anchor active sites effectively. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical, and the selection of proper ligands for encapsulation adds complexity.

Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis aim to reduce energy consumption, though their performances are limited by insufficient CH activation ability and complex reaction mechanisms. Alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, are being developed but have unsatisfactory dehydrogenation performances. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is urgent. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are encouraged. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is challenging. Single atom Pt catalysts for PDH suffer from sintering and reconstruction, necessitating the development of thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts. Novel methods for scale-up production of single atom catalysts provide opportunities.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for industrial propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints. Researchers aim to improve upon PtSn and CrOx systems, which outperform metal oxides in deactivation rates and space velocities. Alternative catalysts, like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, show promise but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and irrecoverable activity. Enhancements are sought to reduce noble metal use, boost catalyst stability, and enhance energy efficiency. Strategies are explored to tackle limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Favorable market conditions for PDH, driven by the price gap between propane and propylene, and the exclusive olefin yield, make dehydrogenation technologies attractive. Optimized for polymer-quality purity, industrial processes are expanding, with numerous PDH installations planned globally. Similar market dynamics for butane dehydrogenation, spurred by automotive demand and naphtha cracking costs, lead to increased butadiene prices and new BDH investments in the US, China, and Japan.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating economic and environmentally friendly processes for their conversion to valuable chemicals. Direct conversion of alkanes to alkenes is sought after due to the reactivity of alkenes in polymer production. However, dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, with alkene selectivity decreasing at higher temperatures due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process designs to synergize dehydrogenation with hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in achieving sufficient propene yields. Ongoing research focuses on gaining insights into CH activation and developing efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation, with a particular emphasis on PDH as an alternative technology for propene production.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures, necessary for propane conversion, can cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke deposition (Quote 1). Researchers address these by introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications (Quote 2), but face issues like excessive metal promoter use (Quote 3) and complex hydroxyl anchoring processes. Encapsulation techniques require proper ligands, and preparing supports with large outer surfaces for diffusion restriction is hindered by the need for rare templates (Quote 11).", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, Pt-based catalysts face challenges including low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies reveal that Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211). Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not accounted for in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces, like Pt(221), show enhanced dehydrogenation activity. The accumulation of CHC intermediates during conversion can lead to coke formation, impacting catalyst performance. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization and controlled synthesis are crucial for identifying and maximizing active, selective sites in real catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
