{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers address these by exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its favorable thermodynamics, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation to COx. New catalysts, like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise with high selectivity to olefins. Alternative metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based, are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is still unsatisfactory. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes, including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, offer energy savings but are limited by insufficient CH activation ability. Revealing active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is urgent, necessitating operando/in situ characterization techniques. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures remains challenging, especially for single-atom catalysts, which suffer from sintering and reconstruction under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is a high priority.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for propylene production faces challenges in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, within thermodynamic constraints. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, which, though promising, deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and have yet to match the performance of PtSn and CrOx systems. Efforts are needed to enhance catalyst stability, reduce noble metal loading, and improve energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price gap between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies offer the advantage of producing a specific olefin, optimized for polymer-quality purity. The global increase in PDH installations and the parallel growth in butane dehydrogenation, driven by automotive demand and naphtha cracking costs, highlight the sector's growth potential.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inertness of lower alkanes, which necessitates indirect or multi-step routes for conversion to valuable chemicals. Developing direct routes for lower alkanes to alkenes is crucial due to the higher reactivity of alkenes and their role as industrial polymer intermediates. However, direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, and alkene selectivity decreases with temperature due to dehydrocyclization, aromatization, cracking, and coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a potential solution by lowering energy requirements. Despite progress, gaps remain between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, particularly in developing ODH catalysts with sufficient propene yield for commercial viability. Research efforts are concentrated on gaining insights into CH activation and designing efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation as an alternative technology for propene production.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for industrial propylene production, key challenges include catalyst deactivation from sintering and coke deposition, necessitating high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity. Strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications aim to build stable catalysts. Hydroxyl anchoring and encapsulation are promising, but excessive promoters and complex ligand selection can be uneconomical. Utilizing supports with large outer surfaces and hierarchical zeolites helps overcome diffusion limitations. High temperatures, though beneficial for conversion, increase side reactions and demand robust catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "Commercial PDH catalysts are Cr- or Pt-based, with Pt-based catalysts facing challenges of low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies show Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt surfaces. Propylene selectivity is higher than 85% on Pt(111) and Pt(100), despite higher desorption barriers, due to thermodynamic corrections not included in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces like Pt(221) exhibit stronger dehydrogenation activity. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier, aligns with experimental observations and suggests a pathway for coke formation. Theoretical studies aim to optimize catalysts for specific processes, but limitations exist in modeling complex catalytic systems, necessitating in situ characterization and controlled synthesis methods to identify and maximize active and selective sites.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
{"DOC": "PDH presents an alternative to petrochemical propylene production, leveraging abundant shale gas. Challenges include high energy use, waste production, and improving Pt-based catalysts for better platinum utilization and cost reduction. Researchers aim to develop catalysts with high-temperature stability, selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, addressing thermodynamic constraints. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts show promise, but stabilizing Pt species under high-temperature conditions remains a hurdle. The introduction of a second metal can enhance performance and reduce coke formation, yet controlling metal agglomeration is critical for industrial application.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058"},

Opportunities lie in improving noble metal loading, catalyst stability, and energy efficiency. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene.
