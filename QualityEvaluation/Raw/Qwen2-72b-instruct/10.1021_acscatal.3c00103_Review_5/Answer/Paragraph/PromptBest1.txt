                    In PDH for industrial propylene production, challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations. High temperatures, though beneficial for propane conversion, cause side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke. Strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications aim to create stable catalysts. However, excessive metal promoters, complex hydroxyl anchoring, and proper ligand selection in encapsulation pose issues \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5\].

                    Pt-based catalysts face challenges including low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Studies reveal Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity. Thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers significantly influence propylene selectivity, not accounted for in DFT calculations. CHC accumulation during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than dehydrogenation, aligns with experimental observations and is a concern for coke formation \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\].

                    PDH for propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for improved Pt-based catalysts to optimize platinum use and reduce costs. Opportunities lie in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene, leveraging the economic and environmental benefits of shale gas. Enhancing Pt-based catalysts' activity and addressing metal agglomeration and deactivation are critical for industrial applications \[10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058\].

                    Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Ongoing research explores alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but requires inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. Alternative catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise with high selectivity to olefins. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is considered for moderate dehydrogenation. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH and ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes like solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are being explored to reduce energy consumption, though their performance is limited \[10.1039/D0CS00814A\].
