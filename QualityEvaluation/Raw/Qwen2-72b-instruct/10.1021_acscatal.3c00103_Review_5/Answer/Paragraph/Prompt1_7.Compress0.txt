Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},

Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
