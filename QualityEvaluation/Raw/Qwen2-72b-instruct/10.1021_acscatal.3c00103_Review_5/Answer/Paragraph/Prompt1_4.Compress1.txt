{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the inertness of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect or multi-step conversion routes. Alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are more reactive and key to industrial polymers, motivating direct conversion technologies. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers potential energy savings. However, alkene selectivity decreases with temperature, and ODH catalysts must balance endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory successes and industrial application, with no ODH catalyst yet meeting industry's propene yield requirements. Ongoing research focuses on CH activation, reaction routes, and developing efficient catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation, with propane dehydrogenation as a critical focus for alternative propene production methods.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},

Researchers are exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for its thermodynamic benefits, despite challenges in inhibiting overoxidation. New catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), show promise in olefin selectivity. Alternative catalysts like VOx- and GaOx-based materials are being developed as potential replacements for CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts, but their performance is currently unsatisfactory. Low-temperature and selective catalysts are crucial for ODH, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) is considered a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with PDH can enhance propane transformation. Ambient temperature catalytic dehydrogenation processes, including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, aim to reduce energy consumption, but their performance is limited by insufficient CH activation ability and complex reaction mechanisms. Identifying active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions is challenging, necessitating the use of operando/in situ characterization techniques. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures presents significant challenges, and developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is a high priority. Novel methods offer opportunities for the scale-up of single atom catalyst production.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS00814A"},
{"DOC": "Challenges in PDH for industrial propylene production involve developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts, like metal oxides, but they deactivate too quickly due to coke deposition and regeneration issues. Current technologies require improvement to lower noble metal loading, increase stability, and enhance energy efficiency. Strategies are needed to overcome limited equilibrium conversion and side reactions at high temperatures. Market conditions favor PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies yield specific olefins and produce polymer-quality purity. New PDH installations are increasing globally, mirroring a similar advantageous market for BDH, driven by automotive demand and high butadiene prices.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"DOC": "In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production, key challenges include the inert nature of lower alkanes, necessitating indirect conversion routes to valuable chemicals. Alkenes, particularly ethene and propene, are more reactive and serve as essential intermediates in industrial polymers, driving efforts for direct alkane conversion. However, high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity are compromised by increased dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation is energy-intensive, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a more efficient alternative. Commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalysts and process designs to synergize endothermic dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogen combustion. Despite extensive research, gaps remain between laboratory successes and industrial application, particularly in achieving sufficient propene yields. Ongoing research aims to understand CH activation and improve catalysts for efficient dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, focusing on propane for alternative propene production methods. The temperature for conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching, and ODH operates at lower temperatures than non-ODH, motivating its development into an industrial technology.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.04.016"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for propylene production, key challenges include high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures, though beneficial for propane conversion, can cause sintering and coke deposition, leading to catalyst deactivation. Researchers are developing strategies like promoter introduction, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to enhance catalyst stability and resistance. However, excessive metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical, encapsulation techniques require proper ligands, and hydroxyl anchoring can be complex and expensive. Utilizing hierarchical zeolites as supports can alleviate diffusion limitations, but rare templates hinder industrial application. Strategies like hydroxyl anchoring and encapsulation show promise, but require further optimization for cost-effectiveness and practicality.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_5"},
{"DOC": "In PDH for propylene production, Pt-based catalysts face challenges with low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation (Quote 1). Research indicates that Pt(211) surfaces exhibit the highest dehydrogenation activity among Pt(111), Pt(100), and Pt(211) (Quote 2). Selectivity for propylene is influenced by thermodynamic corrections for desorption barriers, which are not considered in DFT calculations (Quote 3). The accumulation of CHC during conversion, indicated by a higher dissociation barrier than the dehydrogenation barrier, suggests a propensity for coke formation (Quote 11). These findings highlight the need for catalysts with improved selectivity and stability, addressing thermodynamic limitations in PDH processes.", "Doi": "10.1039/C5SC01227A"},
{"DOC": "PDH for industrial propylene production faces challenges including high energy consumption, waste production, and the need for improved Pt-based catalysts. Opportunities lie in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers aim to enhance Pt-based catalysts for better utilization and cost reduction, addressing metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation. PDH, an alternative to petrochemical routes, is economically and environmentally attractive due to shale gas. Ongoing research focuses on stabilizing Pt species on supports under high-temperature conditions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058"},

{"DOC": "Challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, but these deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and poor regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Market conditions are favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene, and dehydrogenation technologies yield a specific olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial processes are optimized for polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations are under construction worldwide. Similarly, the dehydrogenation of butanes is advantageous due to increased demand from the automotive industry and a decrease in supply from naphtha cracking, leading to higher butadiene prices and investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
