          [1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."
          [11] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [12] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [13] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [14] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."

          Current commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are mainly divided into two categories: Cr-based and Pt-based. Pt-based catalysts have issues with low selectivity for propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have studied propane dehydrogenation on different Pt surfaces, finding that Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity. The selectivity for propylene is influenced by the thermodynamic correction for desorption barriers, which is not included in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces have been shown to have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The accumulation of CHC during the conversion process is a concern, as it can lead to coke formation. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes. Advances in computational methods have allowed for the study of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. However, there are still limitations in modeling realistic catalytic systems, particularly in cases where the structure of the catalyst can change, such as with oxides, and in bi-functional catalysts where reactions occur at the interface. The complexity of these systems makes it challenging to fully explore the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations. Theoretical studies still have a long way to go to provide a complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization techniques and controllable synthesis methods are necessary to identify active sites and maximize the content of highly active and selective sites in real catalysts.

          目前商业丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂主要分为两类:Cr基和Pt基。Pt基催化剂存在丙烯选择性低和因焦炭形成导致快速失活的问题。研究人员研究了不同Pt表面的丙烷脱氢,发现Pt(211)具有最高的脱氢活性。丙烯的选择性受脱附能垒的热力学修正影响,而DFT计算中并未包含这一修正。阶梯表面显示出更高的脱氢活性。在转化过程中CHC的积累是一个问题,因为它可能导致焦炭的形成。理论研究的最终目标是为特定化学过程识别最优催化剂。计算方法的进步使得能够研究更复杂的催化系统,而不仅仅局限于简单的过渡金属表面。然而,在模拟现实的催化系统方面仍存在局限性,特别是在催化剂结构可以改变的情况下,如氧化物,以及在双功能催化剂中,反应发生在界面。这些系统的复杂性使得使用DFT计算完全探索势能表面变得困难。理论研究在提供复杂催化系统完整准确的描述方面还有很长的路要走。原位表征技术和可控合成方法对于识别活性位点和在实际催化剂中最大化高活性和选择性位点的含量是必要的。
