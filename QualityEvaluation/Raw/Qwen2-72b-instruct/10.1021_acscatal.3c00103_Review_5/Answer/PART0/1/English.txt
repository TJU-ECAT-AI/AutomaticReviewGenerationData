The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the development of economic and environmentally friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, lacking low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons, which makes their conversion to valuable chemicals often involve indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are more reactive than alkanes due to their π-electrons and are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. There is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy-intensive reaction, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. Commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite extensive research over two decades, there are still gaps between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Researchers are focusing on gaining insights into CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation, aiming to rationally design new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Propane dehydrogenation is a particular focus due to the need for alternative technologies for propene production. They are surveying non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches and examining intermediate reaction routes between these two main approaches. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching. ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperatures compared to the corresponding non-ODH, which is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design. Despite over two decades of research, there is still a gap between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, and no ODH catalyst has yet been developed that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity in catalysts, while managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures are preferred for high propane conversion, but they can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies such as introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to create high-performance catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to sintering and coke formation. However, these strategies face issues such as the uneconomical use of excessive metal promoters, complex and expensive processes for hydroxyl anchoring, and the need for proper ligands in encapsulation techniques. Additionally, the use of rare templates in preparing supports with large outer surfaces for diffusion restriction is a hindrance to industrial application.

Current commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are mainly divided into two categories: Cr-based and Pt-based. Pt-based catalysts have issues with low selectivity for propylene and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Researchers have studied propane dehydrogenation on different Pt surfaces, finding that Pt(211) has the highest dehydrogenation activity. The selectivity for propylene is influenced by the thermodynamic correction for desorption barriers, which is not included in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces have been shown to have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The accumulation of CHC during the conversion process is a concern, as it can lead to coke formation. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes. Advances in computational methods have allowed for the study of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. However, there are still limitations in modeling realistic catalytic systems, particularly in cases where the structure of the catalyst can change, such as with oxides, and in bi-functional catalysts where reactions occur at the interface. The complexity of these systems makes it challenging to fully explore the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations. Theoretical studies still have a long way to go to provide a complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization techniques and controllable synthesis methods are necessary to identify active sites and maximize the content of highly active and selective sites in real catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy wastes, and the need to improve the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize the precious metal and reduce costs. Opportunities exist in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while addressing thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene and investigating eligible catalysts with good overall performance. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene production, which is economically and environmentally attractive due to the abundance of shale gas containing light alkanes. PDH is significant for industrial relevance. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their considerable activity in PDH reactions, and there is a strong desire to enhance their activity to better utilize the precious metal platinum and reduce catalyst costs. However, the challenge of metal species agglomeration during reactions or regeneration processes, which leads to catalytic deactivation, must be addressed for potential industrial applications. The introduction of a second component has the potential to improve catalytic performance and suppress coke formation during PDH, but stabilizing platinum species on supports under high-temperature reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative to traditional petrochemical routes for producing propylene, a key chemical intermediate. The challenge is to develop efficient catalysts that can operate at high temperatures with good propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions and waste. Researchers are focusing on improving the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize this precious metal and reduce costs. They are also addressing the issue of metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during reactions or regeneration processes, which are critical for the industrial application of PDH catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, which have received significant attention but have not yet provided a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternative formulations often deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Additionally, strategies are being explored to overcome the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The market conditions are very favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being on-purpose techniques, yielding exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.

The selectivity for propylene is influenced by the thermodynamic correction for desorption barriers, which is not included in DFT calculations. Stepped surfaces have been shown to have higher activity for dehydrogenation. The accumulation of CHC during the conversion process is a concern, as it can lead to coke formation. The ultimate goal of theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for specific chemical processes. Advances in computational methods have allowed for the study of more complex catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces. However, there are still limitations in modeling realistic catalytic systems, particularly in cases where the structure of the catalyst can change, such as with oxides, and in bi-functional catalysts where reactions occur at the interface. The complexity of these systems makes it challenging to fully explore the potential energy surfaces with DFT calculations. Theoretical studies still have a long way to go to provide a complete and accurate description of complex catalytic systems. In situ characterization techniques and controllable synthesis methods are necessary to identify active sites and maximize the content of highly active and selective sites in real catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include high energy consumption, production of heavy wastes, and the need to improve the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize the precious metal and reduce costs. Opportunities exist in developing catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while addressing thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by exploring alternative routes to non-petroleum based propylene and investigating eligible catalysts with good overall performance. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene production, which is economically and environmentally attractive due to the abundance of shale gas containing light alkanes. PDH is significant for industrial relevance. Platinum-based catalysts are known for their considerable activity in PDH reactions, and there is a strong desire to enhance their activity to better utilize the precious metal platinum and reduce catalyst costs. However, the challenge of metal species agglomeration during reactions or regeneration processes, which leads to catalytic deactivation, must be addressed for potential industrial applications. The introduction of a second component has the potential to improve catalytic performance and suppress coke formation during PDH, but stabilizing platinum species on supports under high-temperature reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative to traditional petrochemical routes for producing propylene, a key chemical intermediate. The challenge is to develop efficient catalysts that can operate at high temperatures with good propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions and waste. Researchers are focusing on improving the activity of platinum-based catalysts to better utilize this precious metal and reduce costs. They are also addressing the issue of metal agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during reactions or regeneration processes, which are critical for the industrial application of PDH catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity, the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions. Researchers are addressing these challenges by exploring alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which has favorable thermodynamics but presents challenges in inhibiting overoxidation of propylene to COx. They are also investigating new catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which show high selectivity to olefins. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, which have received significant attention but have not yet provided a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternative formulations often deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Additionally, strategies are being explored to overcome the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The market conditions are very favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being on-purpose techniques, yielding exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the development of economic and environmentally friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds. Lower alkanes are relatively inert, lacking low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons, which makes their conversion to valuable chemicals often involve indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are more reactive than alkanes due to their π-electrons and are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. There is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes. However, the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, while alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking, and coke formation. Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy-intensive reaction, but oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation. Commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, including proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts. Despite extensive research over two decades, there are still gaps between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Researchers are focusing on gaining insights into CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation, aiming to rationally design new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. Propane dehydrogenation is a particular focus due to the need for alternative technologies for propene production. They are surveying non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches and examining intermediate reaction routes between these two main approaches. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching. ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperatures compared to the corresponding non-ODH, which is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology. Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation. Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies require innovative catalyst and process design. Despite over two decades of research, there is still a gap between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, and no ODH catalyst has yet been developed that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity in catalysts, while managing thermodynamic limitations and side reactions. High temperatures are preferred for high propane conversion, but they can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies such as introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, and support modifications to create high-performance catalysts with enhanced stability and resistance to sintering and coke formation. However, these strategies face issues such as the uneconomical use of excessive metal promoters, complex and expensive processes for hydroxyl anchoring, and the need for proper ligands in encapsulation techniques. Additionally, the use of rare templates in preparing supports with large outer surfaces for diffusion restriction is a hindrance to industrial application.

Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are being developed for ODH reactions, and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts is being considered as a moderate dehydrogenation technology. Coupling exothermic reactions with endothermic PDH is another strategy to promote propane transformation. Ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes, such as solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are being explored to reduce energy consumption and operating costs, although their performances are currently limited by insufficient CH activation ability and the complex reaction mechanisms. Researchers are also focusing on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which are being developed as potential alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts' dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared to industrial catalysts. The types of supports, promoters, and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures, necessitating the development of novel efficient methods to improve their dehydrogenation performance. Transition-metal nitrides and carbides are being considered as promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts, but the key issue is the development of synthesis methods that produce materials with high surface areas and particle sizes in the nanometer range. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is a significant challenge. Operando/in situ characterization techniques are being encouraged and operated to address this challenge. The roles of different Sn species and coking behaviors on industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are still undiscovered, and the identification of actual active sites on metal oxide-based catalysts, especially under PDH reaction conditions, is difficult due to the presence of various species on their surfaces. Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results, but the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes. Establishing a universal relationship between structure and activity is pressing, especially for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, where the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions. Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH, but the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction, especially under PDH conditions. Developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, which have received significant attention but have not yet provided a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternative formulations often deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Additionally, strategies are being explored to overcome the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The market conditions are very favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being on-purpose techniques, yielding exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.
